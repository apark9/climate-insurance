Robert, take your point about not reading too much into small fluctuations in terms of the average renewal
premium rate increases, but I guess, one thing that stands out is that, at least in the last hard market,
you did see what was very clear acceleration from quarter-to-quarter, in terms of the magnitude of rate
increases, and I was wondering if you could talk about why you think we're not seeing just more obvious
acceleration?
