Well, that’s an ongoing question that we go through with the rating agencies, but if we see the
opportunity, we will shift our risk exposures so that we can be above one-to-one and more in line with 1.2
to 1.0, but that might make us do some things differently on the investment side and it certainly wouldn’t
be a significant expansion on the catastrophe side.
