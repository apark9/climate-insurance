next steps for risk management*

to better integrate climate risks into our risk management process, we intend to perform

the following work in 2023:

— update/enhance the climate risk section of our risk appetite and tolerance;

— perform quantitative scenario analyses (stress tests);

— draft a governance framework for the risks associated with climate change;

— determine whether any key elements of our integrated risk management framework
should be adapted to better reflect the unique nature of climate-related risks;

— ensure that risk owners and other team members who have risk management
responsibilities have the knowledge and capacity needed to effectively identity,
assess and manage climate-elated risks."

activities, underwriting activities and own operations."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"to accelerate
zurich’s understanding of climate risk and ensure consistent management of this risk and
implementation of our commitments to a climate-neutral economy, zurich has established a
cross-functional 1.5°c taskforce that reports into the council and is under the sponsorship of
the group chief underwriting officer."

the un-convened net-zero asset owner alliance."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,carbon_emissions,"as part of the net-zero asset owner alliance, zurich will seek to transition its investment
portfolio to net-zero greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum
temperature rise of 1.5°c."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,carbon_emissions,"during 2020, zurich actively participated in the work of industry bodies such as the net-zero
asset owner alliance and science based targets initiative to develop and test target setting
methodologies for investment portfolios and own operations."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"zurich has developed internal scenarios representing a transition pathway and a physical risk
pathway to guide its assessment of climate change impacts as well as a starting point for in-depth
assessments of related risks and opportunities."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"in the physical risk scenario, an insufficient societal response to limit climate change is assumed,
leading to changes in the frequency, severity and geographical distribution of extreme weather
events such as tropical cyclones and extreme rainfall and associated flooding or heat waves."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"the transition risk scenario is built on an accelerated transition to a low-carbon economy,
requiring fundamental changes to all parts of the economy."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"while limiting climate change to 2°c
or below will lower physical climate risk, the technological and policy changes required create
their own sets of risks."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"transition risks
are considered more uncertain than physical risks, given their dependency on both climate~
related policy changes that could emerge within a short time horizon and other policy changes
related to the management of the global economy."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"zurich uses a climate scorecard to measure transition risk-related indicators, which uses
quantitative data and draws on various climate change scenarios constructed by the ipcc and the
international energy agency (iea)."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"zurich’s assessment shows that a physical risk pathway
currently is significantly more likely than a transition pathway."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"transition risks and physical risks are not mutually exclusive and can potentially co-exist
depending on the timing, speed and effectiveness of the transition pathway."

2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"to accommodate the unfolding nature of climate risk,
zurich considers both near-term (three to five years) and long-term (five to 10 years) time
horizons."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"overall, the group considers its near-term climate change-related physical risks to be
manageable and foreseeable, whereas long-term risks are elevated and highly uncertain."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"zurich is most directly exposed to physical risk of climate change through the property
underwriting and real estate investment portfolios."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"as commercial catastrophe models are typically based on historical data and hence
backward looking, they might not sufficiently account for climate risks already materializing."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"generally, annual policy
renewals provide mitigation increasing physical risks for short-tail business."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"zurich considers the risk to its own operations from climate risk to be less material, as they are
generally not located in highly exposed areas and business continuity plans are in place to ensure
resilience in the face of extreme weather events."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"climate-related transition risk
zurich could be exposed to transition risks if it fails to manage changing market conditions and
customer needs as part of the transition to a climate-neutral economy, resulting in asset
impairment, opportunity cost and lost market share."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"failure to manage transition risk could also lead to reputational impacts, both internal and
external, resulting from a failure to deliver on publicly stated commitments."
2020 TCFD Report.pdf.pdf,climate_risk,"similar to physical risk, the annual nature of the
