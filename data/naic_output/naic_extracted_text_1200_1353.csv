Governance
Priority Health is a nationally recognized nonprofit health benefits company focused on
improving the health and lives of over one million members across Michigan. For over 30 years,
and with 1,600+ employees, Priority Health continues to be recognized as a leader for quality,
customer service, transparency and product innovation. Priority Health is part of an integrated
health system with Corewell Health, a Michigan-based not-for-profit health system with a team
of 65,000+ team members including 11,500+ physicians and advanced practice providers and
15,000+ nurses providing care and services in 22 hospitals, 300+ outpatient locations and
several post-acute facilities. Corewell Health is not only Michigan's largest health system, but
also Michigan's largest private employer. Through experience and collaboration, we are
reimagining a better, more equitable model of health and wellness.
Sustainability is woven into various departments throughout the organization with three
departments predominantly owning the climate change mitigation and resiliency initiatives,
needed to prepare for the effects of climate change. Those three departments include
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Business Assurance, and Sustainability.
The Priority Health enterprise risk management program encompasses the culture, capabilities,
and practices, integrated with strategy-setting and its performance, that organizations rely on to
manage risk in creating, preserving, and realizing value. The program examines the
organization's risks, considers how these risks interrelate and develops an appropriate risk
mitigation approach to address high risk areas in a manner consistent with the organization's
longer-term strategy and overall risk appetite. The goal of the enterprise risk management
process is to identify the organization's most pressing exposures and uncertainties and to focus
improvement activities on actions to manage those exposures more effectively. The Priority
Health Board of Directors has delegated oversight of the Priority Health ERM program to the
Board Finance and Audit committee, and Priority Health relies on the Corewell Health
Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Program to mitigate climate risks through
sustainability efforts.
The Business Assurance Program provides a framework using four distinct domains
(emergency preparedness, operational readiness, business continuity, and situation
management) to promote proactive risk and opportunity identification, analysis, evaluation, and
treatment. This includes loss control and risk strategies that minimize adverse effect of loss and
enhances opportunities within the operational, clinical, safety, human capital, reputational,
strategic, financial, regulatory, technological, and hazard domains of the organization. This team
is currently redesigning their governance structure.
Environmental Sustainability is overseen by the Director of Supplier Performance Management
and Sustainability Analyst who report to the SVP of Supply Chain, the Executive Sponsor for
Sustainability, and the CFO for Corewell Health. Social Sustainability rolls up to the Chief DEI
and Sustainability Officer of Corewell Health. Accountability and transparency have been
established through an executive level Quarterly Steering Team to review goals, progress
against each, celebrate wins, and discuss challenges. Output of the steering team is a quarterly
sustainability report with a deep dive on each goal on at least an annual basis that is shared
with the senior leadership team (SLT).
Metrics and Targets
In line with the Healthcare Anchor Network, the metrics we use to measure progress towards
sustainability related goals include various qualitative and quantitative KPIs respective to each
goal. We have deployed sustainability initiatives broadly across the Corewell Health and Priority

Health integrated system, with goals touching various departments and teams. There is a
sustainability policy in place to provide shared ownership and accountability over sustainability
goals. Our sustainability goals that are relevant to Priority Health include:
** Corewell Health Sustainability Goals relevant to Priority Health
= By 2025:
+ Recycle, compost or reprocess 40% of waste.
* Purchase 20% of total food products from local, diverse and sustainable sources.
* Reduce carbon emissions from energy consumption by 15%.
+ Beginning in 2025:
* 50% of newly purchased or leased fleet vehicles will be electric, hybrid or other
alternative fuel vehicles.
= By 2040:
+ All Corewell Health facilities carbon neutral.
Climate risk related metrics and targets are to be determined. Measurement of Scope 1 and 2
GHG emissions are underway.
Strategy
At Priority Health and Corewell Health, we understand that if we are to deliver on our mission to
improve health, instill humanity and inspire hope, we must purposefully choose actions that
make a positive, sustainable impact on people, our environment, and the economic health of the
communities we serve: People, Planet and Prosperity. Our goal is to be able to meet our
needs without compromising the ability for future generations to fulfil their needs. As an
organization, we view sustainability holistically, taking into consideration all potential influential
aspects, from product procurement to patient treatment, customer service and everything in
between.
By integrating business continuity and emergency management practices, Corewell Health and
Priority Health can effectively address climate risks and reduce vulnerability to potential
disruptions. The Business Assurance team contributes to climate risk mitigation and resiliency
by:

+ Identifying and prioritizing the essential functions and assets that are most exposed to
climate hazards and implementing strategies to protect them.

+ Developing and testing contingency plans and procedures for responding to and
recovering from different types of emergencies and disasters, such as floods, storms,
wildfires, or cyberattacks.

+ Building and maintaining relationships with internal and external stakeholders, such as
employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, and emergency responders, and ensuring
effective communication and coordination during a crisis.

+ Enhancing the capacity and capability of the organization to adapt to changing
conditions and to learn from past experiences and best practices.

+ Promoting a culture of preparedness and resilience that fosters awareness,
engagement, and innovation among staff and leaders. The Business Assurance team is
essential for ensuring operational continuity in a changing and uncertain environment.

Additionally, the sustainability team is focused on climate change mitigation and resiliency by
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste at an operational level. To date, Corewell
Health and Priority Health has committed to the Impact Purchasing Commitment (IPC) through
the Healthcare Anchor Network (HAN), which is an organization that catalyzes health systems
to build inclusive local economies to address economic and racial inequities in community
conditions that create poor health. By signing the IPC, we have committed to aligning our

purchasing power to improve societal health and well-being and to catalyze prosperity for all,
particularly those impacted by a legacy of divestment and discrimination. Below is a list of
sustainability initiatives we accomplished in 2023:

* Energy efficiency, optimization and shift to renewable energy resulted in 2.7% reduction
in carbon emissions specific to energy use.

* Installation of ten EV level 2 charging stations at our business service center located in
Southfield, MI which provides energy to fleet, staff, and visitor electric vehicles.

+ Transitioned 12% of fleet vehicles to hybrid vehicles.

+ In 2023, Corewell Health and Priority Health recycled and composted 2,535 tons of
waste.

* Significant progress made on each of our four HAN goals (Waste Anesthesia Gas,
Alternative Fuel Vehicles, Greening the Operating Room, and Sustainable Food) through
workgroup structure, quarterly progress and data reporting, as well as clinical and
executive support.

+ Corewell Health signed an agreement with our energy company, DTE, called the
MiGreenPower program, to offset 50% of our East region emissions to be generated from
renewable resources,

+ Weare in the end stages of conducting our first ever Sustainability Materiality Assessment
which has invited input from nearly 100 internal and external stakeholders to help guide our
environmental sustainability strategy over the next 3-5 years.

* Launched a green team business resource group called Planet Health BRG. This is a
grassroots employee group focused on sustainability for Corewell Health and Priority Health.

*  Acontinued focus on sustainable, local, and diverse owned food/beverage businesses
resulted in 13% sustainable food spend, 28% in local food spend, and 23% in diverse-
owned food/beverage business spend in 2023.

* In May of each year, the Greater Grand Rapids Bicycle Coalition organizes a week in
which the goal is to walk, run, ride a bike, or carpool to work called Active Commute
Week. Priority Health takes a prominent role in helping to promote and sponsor this
weeklong event.

* Hosted an electronics recycling event for team members to bring in old, damaged, or
unwanted electronics to be recycled, diverting 14,938 Ibs. of electronic waste from going
to the landfill in honor of Earth Day.

+ Corewell Health's goal to be carbon neutral by 2040 represents a long-term investment
in improving the local, regional, and global environment that reflects the organization's
longstanding commitment to improving community health.

Risk Management

Priority Health's Enterprise Risk Management program includes design of metrics - KPIs and
KRis - related to Operational, Financial, Strategic, Information Security, and Compliance risk
domains. Climate Change has been added to the 2025 Strategic Risk Assessment which will be
used to help determine the top risks for 2025. Enterprise Risk Management will partner with
business owners to evaluate the current environmental initiatives we have in place as they
relate to sustainability. Metrics will be adjusted based on feedback from business owners during
the annual risk assessment process.

1. Governance
‘At the core of our organizational structure lies two reciprocal exchanges. Privilege Underwriters
Reciprocal Exchange (“PURE”) is an admitted insurance company domiciled in the state of
Florida. PURE Specialty Exchange (“PSE”) is a non-admitted insurance company domiciled in the
state of Arizona. For each reciprocal, there is a for-profit attorney-in-fact appointed to manage
the affairs of the insurance company on behalf of the policyholders (“members”). Each attorney-
in-fact is owned by a holding company called Privilege Underwriters Inc. (“PUI”) and ultimately
by Tokio Marine Holdings (“TMHD""). The insurance companies are member-owned and each
have an advisory committee constructed of members and/or their broker representatives. A
diagram of our organizational structure is provided below. Throughout our responses to the
survey, we will refer to the “PURE Group” for all companies owned by or managed by PUI.
All public statements regarding climate risk have been made at the TMHD level and can be
viewed at the following web site:
https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/sustainability/
In addition, specific to the PURE Group, we are committed to the following:
= Providing insurance solutions and risk management practices to our target market in the
personal lines insurance space
= Abstaining from knowingly financing or directly investing in companies that generate
revenues from the ownership, exploration, mining or refining of thermal coal and coal-
fired energy production
- Committing to ESG-focused investments within our PURE Foundation and seeking out
additional impact-focused investments within the portfolios of our insurance companies

- Stress testing the physical risks our members face given potential climate change
outcomes

= Remaining carbon neutral from 2021 onwards, and reducing our scope 1 and scope 2
emissions to the extent feasible

‘As mentioned above, all public climate-related disclosure is currently provided by TMHD.
However, climate-related matters are discussed both with the PUI Board of Directors and with
each of the advisory committees for the member-owned reciprocals on an annual basis, at
minimum. The PURE Group has compiled a TCFD report that can be found in the “Sustainability
News” section of the web site mentioned above.

Within the PURE Group, we have adopted a “Three Lines of Defense” risk governance model:
1. First line of defense ~ day-to-day accountability for departmental risks lies with the
associated business unit employees and managers who own and manage risks.

2. Second line of defense ~ management establishes various risk management and
compliance functions to help build and/or monitor the first line of defense controls. We
have a Risk Steering Committee and a Sustainability Committee within the second line
of defense.

a. The Risk Steering Committee consists of seven members, is responsible for
enterprise risk management oversight, and has identified catastrophe risk, and
the impacts of climate change, as a material risk to the insurance companies we
manage. We monitor catastrophe trends and report KPI's to the PUI board on a
quarterly basis.

b. The Sustainability Committee consists of ten members and is responsible for
documenting the companies’ commitments and organizing workflows to
accomplish sustainability efforts including tracking and offsetting our carbon
footprint annually.

3. Third line of defense - the Internal Audit function provides the Board of Directors and
Senior Management assurance based on assessment of key risks, test of Sabanes-Oxley
controls, and risk based internal audits.

‘MHD has put in place the Sustainability Division of the Corporate Planning Department,
dedicated to the advancement of the Group's sustainability efforts including climate change
countermeasures. The Sustainability Division identifies major challenges, develops and
implements group-wide related strategies, and supports regular monitoring of sustainability
efforts.

Group Chief Sustainability Officer (CSUO)

‘TMHD established the new position of CSUO in April 2021 to further accelerate the promotion
of sustainability strategy across the entire Group Companies (GCs) including climate change
countermeasures. The CSUO is responsible for its sustainability strategy and for addressing
sustainability issues facing the entire Group with regular reporting to TMHD’s Group CEO.
Sustainability Committee

TMHD also established the Sustainability Committee in April 2021, chaired by the CSUO and
comprised of members including the CEO and other C-suites. The Sustainability Committee has

the primary mandate to establish sustainability strategies and develop target measurement for
the entire Group to weight the risk and return of global sustainability initiatives.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is charged with discussion of Group sustainability policies including
climate change countermeasures as well as the evaluation and determination of mid-term and
single-year plans.
Membership includes outside directors and Audit/Supervisory Board members to fully utilize the
knowledge available from outside of TMHD.
Organizational Structure for Promoting Sustainability
The TMHD Sustainability Division, CSUO, and Sustainability Committee are responsible for the
promotion of Group-wide initiatives and coordination with other subcommittees and task
forces, which have dotted line connections for support and input. Under this structure, TMHD
aims to simultaneously achieve two goals:
‘© Specifically enhance Tokio Marine Group's social value by solving social issues
through its business activities and contributing to a sustainable society; and
‘© Enhancing its economic value by achieving medium- to long-term growth for Tokio
Marine Group (the Group) through such initiatives.
The Group will realize medium to long-term growth while promoting a shared understanding of
the aims and context of its mid to long-term sustainability strategy throughout the Group and
strengthen its initiatives to solve issues relating to a sustainable earth and society.

2. Strategy
2.1. Corporate Responsibility

‘At the end of September 2020, TMHD published its thoughts on climate change in “Tokio
Marine: Our Climate Strategy,” which was revised at the end of September 2021 and the end of
September 2022. In the statement, TMHD commits itself to supporting the Group's clients and
investees in the transition to a decarbonized society.
Within the PURE Group, we discuss climate-related matters within the PUI Board and with the
subscribers advisory committees of the reciprocal exchanges we serve. In addition, we have
disclosed our carbon neutral status to members in our annual report.
PURE maintains an active greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, which is used to quantify all
unabated emissions produced within our organizational and operational boundary. This
inventory contains a list of emission sources and the associated emissions quantified using
standardized methods developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and guidance from the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by the World Resources
Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), which is
the global standard for calculating corporate GHG emissions (GHG Inventory Development
Process and Guidance 2021).
PURE has adopted and implemented the following 4-step process recommended by the EPA for
GHG Inventory development and emissions tracking to quantify company carbon emissions for
the year 2023 and plans to purchase carbon credits to offset all scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions to
achieve carbon neutrality for the year 2023:

Step 1: Scope and Plan Inventory

Step 2: Collect Data and Quantify GHG Emissions

Step 3: Develop a GHG Inventory Management Plan

Step 4: Set a GHG Emission Reduction Target and Track and Report Progress
PURE’s emissions in 2021 are used as a baseline for future comparisons of emissions and to
track the impact of mitigation strategies put in place. One such mitigation strategy PURE has
begun to implement is the conversion of the company vehicle fleet from traditionally powered
vehicles using only gasoline or diesel engines to a hybrid vehicle fleet. In 2023, we made
progress towards our goal of adding hybrid vehicle options for employees. As of October 2023,
over 50% of our fleet (117 of 192 cars) are hybrid vehicles.
Additionally, to ensure that the calculation of emissions is consistent with standards and
principles of GHG Protocol, PURE commissioned an independent verification of emissions which
provides confidence that the reported emissions represent a faithful, true, and fair account of
the company's emissions.

2.2. Risks & Opportunities to PURE Insurance
Within the PURE Group, we have aligned with the short, medium and long-term guidance from
the TCFD framework. The chart below represents our identification of key risks and
opportunities in each timeframe.

Our insurance products have been designed solely for the personal lines industry. We do not
insure commercial lines.
Our risk management practices include in-person engagement with members to discuss
resiliency of their homes and frequently includes requirements and recommendations for

improvements to uphold to catastrophic exposures. We have a well-trained Risk Management
team that performs inspections, researches new technologies, and works with top vendors in
the industry. Home inspections performed by our risk managers on new homeowner policies
can identify hazards of the property that could lead to, or increase the magnitude of, climate
related losses. Our risk managers are trained to educate and instruct members on ways to avoid
and contain risk to effectively cover climate change risks as they arise. The vendors we partner
with offer various services and product recommendations that include arborist evaluation
services, natural gas generator solutions, wildfire mitigation programs, and lightning
suppression systems. The company also offers credits to promote the installation of leak
defense water automatic shutoff devices which help to conserve water and prevent large water
damage claims.
‘Our understanding is that we are one of the few carriers to offer a wildfire mitigation program.
‘Our program includes pre-fire and emergency response services intended to reduce, and even
prevent, loss from wildfire. Those enrolled in this program receive a visit from a reputable
vendor who is a leader in wildfire protection. The preventive service includes an inspection for
wildfire vulnerability concerning the landscape around the home and identification of
flammable materials close to the home, such as a wood pile on a porch or a wood shingle roof.
This vendor can also apply Phos-Chek, the same long-term fire retardant that is used by the US
Forest Service.
2.3. Climate Scenarios
To date, our stress testing scenarios have been focused on testing flood and hurricanes. We
employ industry-leading catastrophe models to simulate risk across a stochastic set of events.
‘Assuming changes in both the frequency of hurricanes and construction of the storms, we have
estimated probabilities of loss thresholds under various circumstances using guidance from the
U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority. The figures below provide relative differences between
current estimates and stress tests under Scenario A: A sudden disorderly transition in 2022;
Scenario B: A long-term orderly transition into 2050; and Scenario C: Four degrees Celsius
warming by 2100.

If those scenarios were to occur, our actions would need to contemplate a combination of the
following: creating a more resilient membership in terms of home construction and risk
mitigation techniques; a moderation of increases in capacity for coastal risks; or increases in
premiums and/or capital to support the underlying risk.

3. Risk Management
‘MHD conducts enterprise risk management (ERM), which includes the management of climate
risks. Through the ERM cycle, TMHD comprehensively identifies and assesses risks, using both
qualitative and quantitative approaches. In the insurance business, which pursues profit through
risk-taking, risk assessment is the foundation of the Group’s business. TMHD has been working
for many years to assess material risks (including those due to natural disasters) both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Specific initiatives are as follows.
(1) Qualitative Risk Management
‘TMHD identifies all forms of risk exhaustively, including natural disasters such as major storms
and newly emerging risks due to environmental changes. TMHD defines risks that will have an
extremely large impact on the Group's financial soundness and business continuity as “material
risks.”
‘TMHD includes the risk of major windstorms and floods in the “material risks” category, which
could become more frequent and severe due to the effects of climate change. TMHD also
formulates control measures prior to risk emergence and response measures for after risks
occur.
(2) Quantitative Risk Management
For material risks, through measuring risk amounts and implementing stress tests as part of the
‘TMHD's quantitative risk management, TMHD is able to perform a multifaceted review of the
adequacy of capital relative to the risks held for the purpose of maintaining ratings and
preventing bankruptcy. TMHD calculates risk amounts posed by natural disasters using a risk
model (for Japan, a risk model developed in-house based on engineering theory and the latest
knowledge of natural disasters, and for overseas, models provided by outside vendors). TMHD.
independently analyzes past tropical cyclones (typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United
States), torrential rains, and other changing trends and incorporate this data as necessary to
properly assess current weather phenomena. Furthermore, within material risks, TMHD
conducts stress tests based on scenarios in which extreme economic losses are expected and
scenarios where multiple material risks occur at the same time. As for risks involving major wind
and flood disasters, for example, TMHD assumes these scenarios to be on a much larger scale
than the major typhoons that hit the Greater Tokyo Area in 2018 and 2019 causing extensive
damages. TMHD updates scenarios continuously while taking into account stress tests released
by regulatory authorities of every country, the latest knowledge (including that of climate
change), and recent case studies.

Specific to the PURE Group, internal audit and ERM teams collaborate with departmental
leaders annually to review existing processes, identify both existing and emerging trends, and
assess potential risks. Scores are provided for each potential risk on an inherent basis (prior to
controls) and a residual basis (after applying controls). An operational risk distribution is then
created and included within our economic capital model. A final emerging risks heat map is
produced which can have an effect on medium to long-term corporate strategy. For climate
change effects, our catastrophe modeling team performs an annual assessment as disclosed
above. In addition, our Sustainability Committee meets regularly to coordinate activities of
functional departments to meet our objectives. Action is then taken at the functional level.
PURE has adopted the following investment guideline to mitigate the transition risk associated
with this movement away from carbon: The Company shall not make loans to finance any of the
{following types of projects: (i) coal-fired power generation, (ii) thermal coal mining, (iii) oil sands
‘mining, or (iv) oil and gas mining in the Arctic region. In compliance with the California
Department of Insurance's Climate Risk Carbon Initiative, the Company shall not invest in other
{forms of thermal coal investments. Thermal coal investments are defined as direct investments
in companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from either the ownership,
exploration, mining, or refining of thermal coal. The restriction also applies to all publicly and
privately-owned utility companies that generate 30% or more of their electricity from thermal
coal.
The Company has an Investment & Finance Committee (the “Committee”), which consists of five
Directors from the Company’s Board which oversees PURE’s investment portfolio. The

Committee meets quarterly to monitor, review and determine strategy for PURE’s investment
portfolio. The Committee will discuss climate-related risks and opportunities as they are
relevant at the direction of Management.

PURE considers climate-related risks and their investment impact in the following categories.
With regards to investments, PURE regards the below risks in order of impact from most impact
to least impact.

1. Transition Risk. Risks arising from market, policy, technological and social changes,
affecting business models and profitability of companies and sectors (e.g. energy,
industry, transportation, agriculture) leading to impacts on financial assets and
portfolios. Generally, PURE’s exposure to carbon-intensive companies likely to face
regulatory pressure is limited but we view this as the largest risk for investments. In
2016 PURE voluntarily sold all of its current holdings of thermal coal assets as defined by
the California Department of Insurance and voluntarily agreed not to make any new
such investments in the future. Additionally, transition risk is considered by PURE’s
outsourced investment managers during the acquisition of investment securities.

2. Physical Risk. Impacts of physical climate events and trends on assets, firms and sectors,
affect the profitability and cost of businesses leading to the impacts on financial assets
and portfolios. The physical risk of climate change relates to our investment portfolio to
a lesser extent but is far more prevalent in our main course of business ~ insuring
residential homes in areas with climate change risk. Sound diversification of investment
assets across geography, sector and individual securities (single-name risk) reduces the
potential impact of physical risk from climate change for PURE’s overall investment
portfolio.

3. Liability Risk. Reputational and litigation-related risks from not taking into account or
disclosing climate change impacts, leading to impacts on financial assets and portfolios.
We feel this risk is also limited within the investment portfolio and more prevalent in
‘our main course of business.

4, Metrics and Targets

4.1. Catastrophe Risk

PURE has in place risk tolerance statements to inform portfolio management activities and
reinsurance needs of the memberships. The statements are not publically available; however,
we can share they are a function of the modeled catastrophe risk at various probabilities, the
amount of premium written within the insurance company, and policyholder surplus. While
hurricanes and flooding are the main climate-related risks assessed via licensed in-house
catastrophe models, we also model earthquake, winter storm, severe convective storm, and
wildfire perils on a quarterly basis, along with other perils on an ad-hoc basis.
The aforementioned risk tolerance statements are established and monitored quarterly at the
PUI Board level. The company manages catastrophe exposure to a number of KPls, mostly

related to capital consumption. Key measures related to climate include the 1:250 year VaR and
the 1:100 xTVar.
The insurance companies we manage limit the amount of capital depleted in 1:250 year
catastrophe scenarios and have explicit access to additional capital beyond that level.
4.2. Investment Risk
PURE has adopted the investment guideline to mitigate the transition risk associated with this
movement away from carbon as disclosed above.
4.3. Environmental Responsibility
The PURE Group has achieved carbon neutrality as of 2022 and our goal is to remain carbon
neutral in all future years while working to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions to the extent
possible. The figure below represents full year 2023 emissions for the PURE Group.

Sustainability and Our Environmental Commitment
Overview
ProAssurance’s mission states that We Protect Others. We strive to achieve that mission by
adhering to a set of core values, unbending Integrity, Leadership that works, superior
Relationships and infectious Enthusiasm. As we apply these values to achieve our mission in
business, we also apply them to our stewardship of the environment. We are committed to policies
and practices that demonstrate our concern for the environment and the impact our operations will
have today and into the future. We are attentive to the environmental effects of the materials we
use in our daily operations, the systems we use to efficiently serve our customers, and our facilities
management.
The environmental impact of ProAssurance is minimal because of the nature of our business.
Nevertheless, we will work within our operations to mitigate our environmental impact and
promote a respect for our environment within our workforce.
ProAssurance Environmental Policy
ProAssurance must balance the needs of many stakeholders, ranging from our policyholders to our
distribution partners to our shareholders and our employees. The decisions we make about energy
use, the purchase of consumables and supplies, and workplace practices all must take into account
our environmental footprint. We are committed to continually improving the environmental
sustainability of our operations and business activities. Our Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee has responsibility for Environmental, Society and Governance impact.
We pledge to comply with relevant environmental regulations wherever we operate. We will
continue to work to implement energy-efficiency initiatives and will consider the conservation/
environmental features of buildings where we rent or lease space and will utilize and promote
environmentally sustainable construction practices and building features when renovating existing
spaces where we operate in order to produce healthy, sustainable workplaces for our employees
and onsite contractors.
We continually work, to reduce our energy consumption through efficiency initiatives that address
energy use associated with lighting and other energy consuming systems.
Asanon-manufacturing company, our water usage is limited to personal consumption and hygiene.
Because of the variability of water consumption and use, we are unable to reliably report total
water use by location or at the enterprise level. We do not monitor wastewater discharge given the
non-manufacturing nature of our consumption, We are unable to recycle water consumed
personally or used in hygiene, and thus cannot report on the percentage of water recycled or reused.
Also as a non-manufacturing company, we do not generate industrial-seale emissions of nitrogen
oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) or particulate matter (PM)
and other significant air pollutants, but we recognize that our employees’ commuting and business
travel do produce such emissions. We believe our expanded commitment to telework programs
and the reduction of travel through video conferencing and teleconferencing will continue to
mitigate such personally-created emissions. As an enterprise, we do not produce non-methane
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and are committed to the use of non-VOC products,
especially paint and coatings, in our buildings as a matter of employee and contractor and
environmental health,
1[Page ffeetive July 10, 2024

ry PROASSURANCE.

Sustainability and Our Environmental Commitment
Further, because of the nature of our business, we do not produce hazardous waste. Each of our
facilities provide containers for the proper disposal of personally-created hazardous waste such as
needles used for prescribed injections (e.g., insulin).
We do not have any projects in areas of high biodiversity, and we are committed to the use of
external standards or guidelines to identify areas of high biodiversity before embarking on any
new or expansion projects, which we believe to be highly unlikely at this point.
Environmental Actions
We are reducing our use of paper and increasing our efficiency and time-to-market through the use
of technology that promotes a paperless transaction flow to reduce the amount of paper we
purchase. By moving toward a paperless transaction environment, we expect to increase the quality
and efficiency of the services provided to our insureds, our distribution partners and our
employees. In addition to saving on paper costs and reducing our waste stream, the creation and
delivery of documents electronically will have the added benefit of reducing a variety of direct
costs including those for photocopier supplies and postage as well as reducing the need for storage
space and filing equipment.
We are already ensuring that sensitive data that is printed and no longer used for a legitimate
business purpose, or documents of that nature that have reached the end of their required/allowable
retention period are shredded and recycled.
As we adapted our work practices to respond to the dislocations of the COVID-19 pandemic, we
introduced highly flexible remote work options for virtually all employees whose jobs do not
require physical presence in an office. Approximately 40% of our workforce is entirely remote,
and 55% work under hybrid arrangements. We thus have substantially reduced emissions
associated with automobile commuting and carbon footprint associated with leased office space.
By reducing the number of commuting days, we will positively affect the environment and provide
a much-desired benefit to employees.
Further, since 2014 we have spent in excess of $7.25 million installing teleconferencing and video
conferencing equipment to link all our facilities. As a result, we have decreased travel costs and
increased productivity by facilitating frequent communication as we have averaged approximately
8300 electronically-facilitated meetings per month.
Addressing Climate Change
ProAssurance recognizes the need for a sustainable environment as a fundamental requirement for
a stable society and a strong economy, which benefits consumers and businesses alike. Regardless
of how one interprets the science of climate change, the bottom line is that it is occurring and is
‘one of the most significant risks facing our world right now. Thus, addressing climate change is an
economic imperative as mitigation now will be exponentially less expensive than repairing the
damage should society fail to act in the near term. We are cognizant of the need to do everything
‘we can to ensure our business reflects environmentally-friendly practices.
2[Page ffeetive July 10, 2024

ry PROASSURANCE.

Sustainability and Our Environmental Commitment
ProAssurance is committed to policies and planning that address cost-effective solutions to
mitigating the risks associated with the threat of climate change. Where applicable, we are
addressing potential outcomes in our strategic decision making by including the risks of climate
change in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, both in our lines of business and at
the corporate level. If potential risks are identified within our lines of business, we engage in a
comprehensive evaluation process by involving relevant internal stakeholder groups. These risks
are elevated, as appropriate, to our corporate-level ERM process, where they are considered
alongside threats specific to corporate-level functions. The resulting report of ERM risk factors is
reported to, and discussed with, the Board of Directors which serves as our corporate Risk
Committee.

Our Workers’ Compensation and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segments are also affected
by changing climate conditions, as extreme weather has often been linked to a higher incidence of
work-related accidents. As a further example of our response to identified threats, we have
tightened our underwriting, addressed needed pricing changes and expanded our risk management
programs to mitigate these potential risks.

Plan Response to Governance - Narrative
Providence Health Plan and Providence Health Assurance (collectively, “PHP”) are part of the Providence
Health System (“Providence”). Providence has adopted the WE ACT framework focused on five key
areas of environmental stewardship, including: waste, energy and water, agriculture and food,
chemicals, and transportation. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions in these areas, Providence is
working toward carbon negative by 2030. Providence maintains the following website outlining its goals
and commitments: https://www.providence.org/about/advocacy-and-social-
responsibility/environmental-stewardship. Climate related disclosures for PHP are handled at the
individual legal entity level. The Compliance and Risk Committee of PHP’s board is responsible for
climate risk governance as part of its delegated enterprise risk oversight and receives bi-annual updates
on material enterprise risks from the Chief Compliance & Risk Officer. Detailed reporting to the board
on a climate-related risk would take place should such risk be assessed as material under PHP’s
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. PHP’s ERM framework and processes are leveraged for
identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks across the enterprise, including climate-related risks. This
framework includes an established Compliance & Risk Committee consisting of senior leaders for
providing ongoing review, management and monitoring of PHP’s key enterprise risks. As PHP has not
identified any climate change risks posing a material impact on its business, it is not actively managing
any climate-related risks at this time.

Plan Response to Risk Management — Narrative
Climate risk is addressed by PHP’s established ERM Framework, which includes the annual enterprise
risk assessment process for identifying enterprise level risks having a material impact on PHP’s business.
PHP’s updated risk taxonomy includes climate change and provides a comprehensive set of risk
categories for review and consideration by those involved in the enterprise risk identification process.
This process includes interviews with senior leaders and survey questionnaires to key leaders across the
organization by which an expansive list of risks is narrowed down to a set of key risks. Upon arriving at a
final consolidated list of key risks, members of the Compliance & Risk Committee participate in a risk
voting session to score risks based on both the likelihood of occurrence and impact. Financial
implications of each key risk are assessed as part of assigning an impact score. Results of the voting
session include a list of PHP’s “Top risks.”
PHP's top enterprise level risks are reviewed by executive leadership and action plans for mitigating
these risks are developed by applicable risk owners. As PHP has not identified climate-related risks
materially impacting its business or affecting trend or utilization of healthcare services amongst its
members, it has not developed risk management practices specific to climate change. Should a climate
risk be deemed material through PHP’s enterprise risk assessment process, formal controls, and action
plans for addressing related risk exposures and impacts would be developed. Physical risks relating to
climate change are also addressed as part of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery programs at
PHP, which addresses data loss prevention and recovery of critical business functions during unexpected
disruption. To date, PHP has not observed or quantified meaningful changes in the value of its
investment portfolio that are principally attributable to climate change.

applications, the use of cloud infrastructure, hybrid work schedules for employees, centrally controlled HVAC, and
automatic lighting in the office. PLICA’s assessment, reduction and mitigation of its greenhouse gas emissions is an
ongoing discussion. PLICA does not perform sensitivities using climate change metrics due to the nature of the
business it writes.

Introduction
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) established the Task Force on Climate-Related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in December 2015 to design a set of recommendations
for consistent disclosures to improve and increase reporting of climate-related
financial information. The recommendations are structured around four thematic areas
that represent core elements of how companies operate: governance, strategy, risk
management, and metrics and targets.
In this report, we disclose the progress we have made throughout the 2023 reporting
year in developing our processes as we further integrate the recommendations of the
CFD across our existing business.

Business risks, including those associated with climate change, are identified and assessed by the
ERM Council, consisting of mid-to-senior level employees, and its results are shared with the ERM
Executive Steering Committee at least quarterly. The ERM Executive Steering Committee is responsible
for assisting the Board in the fulfilment of its risk oversight responsibilities.
Our senior executive management team regularly monitors and discusses risks related to our
businesses through various management committees. The ESG Steering Committee, which comprises
a cross-functional management team is responsible for assisting leadership and ensuring the business
considers climate-related risks and opportunities throughout its strategy development, reporting and
communications.
The ESG Steering Committee consists of officers and other employees with varied experiences and
disciplines including but not limited to environmental, health and safety, operations, legal, investor
relations, government affairs, risk management, corporate governance, finance, human capital
management and communications.
‘The ERM Council and ESG Steering Committee regularly engage with subject matter experts across
our businesses to ensure climate-related risks and opportunities are accurately identified, assessed
and managed.
Strategy and Risk
TCFD guidance requests that companies disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-
related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial
planning where such information is material.
We recognize that climate change is a complex issue which
presents a range of risks and opportunities that may impact
our ability to successfully achieve our business strategy
over time.

Vv,
To ensure our business remains resilient, we aim to identify,
assess and manage the current and emerging climate-
related risks and opportunities across our business as per
the TCFD-aligned guidance. 4

Q
We have identified three transition risks, representing those
risks associated with the transition to a decarbonized
economy. In addition, we have identified two physical risks,
representing those risks associated with the physical impact
of climate change.
Moving forward we aim to continuously enhance our climate risk assessment to ensure new and
evolving risks and opportunities associated with climate change are accurately identified, assessed
and accounted for throughout our business strategy and decision making.
In addition to our own efforts to manage climate-related risks, the vast majority of the loans we insure are
sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs), who are the largest beneficiaries of our mortgage insurance
and are actively analyzing and managing the climate-related risks in their own portfolios.

Risk Management

We utilize an ERM framework that is designed to

identify and evaluate the most significant risks

we face and to calibrate risk mitigation strategies

to account for challenges in the current business

environment, as well as external factors that may

negatively impact our operations.

A cross-functional team, guided by subject matter

experts and experienced managers, follows a ad

systematic method to identify, evaluate and

monitor both known and emerging risks, including

the impact of climate change.

Quarterly risk reviews are conducted, during

which various risk scoring metrics are re-assessed, to account for changes in markets and the

regulatory environment, in addition to other internal or external factors. Risk scoring and validation

of the effectiveness of risk management plans through management reporting facilitate program
sustainability and promote accountability for risk management activities throughout the company.

Radian categorizes risks based on their current or potential future impact on the organization when

evaluating them in ERM quarterly risk review assessments. Climate-related considerations are

interwoven into the risks that we monitor, including the following potential risks: climate/natural
catastrophe, political/socio-economic, business interruption, model forecasting, counterparty
disruption, supply chain disruption, and our various strategic and operational risks associated with
our key business areas.

Risk Mitigation and

IT Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

Efforts to Manage this Risk

+ Radian’s IT Disaster Recovery and Safety, Security, and Resilience programs are designed to
assess and mitigate environmental risks, including natural disasters, that may impact Radian’s
sites, personnel, and operations. The team coordinates across enterprise critical functions
and leadership to develop appropriate strategic and mitigative risk responses and business
continuity/recovery solutions. The management-led ERM Council, ERM Executive Steering
Committee, Executive Information Security Committee, Enterprise Information Governance
Committee, Resilience Executive Committee, and other enterprise-wide management committees
regularly discuss the disaster recovery and business continuity risks across the organization.

+ Radian’s Safety, Security, and Resilience program annually assesses the risk of natural
catastrophe across key office and geographic locations, including climate-related catastrophes
and risks, and for the past four years, the program generally has determined that these risks
represent a low residual business interruption risk for the company.

8

Mortgage Insurance
Efforts to Manage this Risk
+ Radian Guaranty’s mortgage insurance Master Policy generally excludes coverage for any cost or
expense related to the repair or remedy of any physical damage to a property insured by Radian
Guaranty if physical damage was the principal cause of the mortgage default. Therefore, Radian
Guaranty’s Master Policy, subject to certain conditions, generally does not provide protection
against property loss or physical damage, including damage caused by hurricanes or other
severe weather events or natural disasters.
+ Premiums for our mortgage insurance products are generally established based on performance
models that consider a broad range of borrower, loan and property characteristics as well
as current and projected market and economic conditions, which may include the impact of
climate-related events on home prices and employment in a specific geographic region. If a
property that is being underwritten for mortgage insurance is impacted by a natural disaster,
a recertification of the property inspection and valuation may be required prior to us agreeing
to insure the mortgage in the property. For properties in our mortgage insurance portfolio that
have been impacted by a natural disaster, we work with the mortgage servicers to ensure that
borrowers are offered loss mitigation options, such as payment forbearance, to assist borrowers
through a short-term hardship.
Title Insurance
Title insurance does not cover claims resulting from environmental risks, including natural disasters
such as hurricanes, so these are not factored into the underwriting of the title insurance product.

RESPONSE TO GOVERNANCE
Various initiatives related to climate action are reported to the Board of Directors of Tokio Marine Holdings (TMHD),
the ultimate parent company of Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company, First Reliance Standard Life
Insurance Company and Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York (the Reliance Companies), after
the execution level discussion at the Sustainability Committee and Management Meeting. In TMHD's governance
structure, each relevant execution body promotes initiatives under the supervision of TMHD's Board of Directors.
Key related bodies and their roles are as follows.
A Division Dedicated to Promoting Sustainability
TMHD has put in place the Sustainability Division of the Corporate Planning Department, dedicated to the
advancement of the Tokio Marine Group's (the Group) sustainability efforts including climate change
countermeasures. The Sustainability Division identifies major challenges, develops and implements group-wide
related strategies, and supports regular monitoring of sustainability efforts.
Group Chief Sustainability Officer (CSU)
TMHD established the new position of CSUO in April 2021 to further accelerate the promotion of sustainability
strategy across the entire Group Companies (GCs) including climate change countermeasures. The CSUO, a
Director, oversees the promotion and permeation of TMHD’s sustainability strategy, presents related policies to
its Board of Directors and the Management Meeting for discussion and takes the role of reporting the progress
to these bodies. The CSUO is responsible for its sustainability strategy and for addressing sustainability issues
facing the entire Group with regular reporting to TMHD's Group CEO.

2

Sustainability Committee
TMHD also established the Sustainability Committee in April 2021, chaired by the CSUO and comprised of
members including the CEO and other C-suites. The Sustainability Committee has the primary mandate to
establish sustainability strategies and develop target measurement for the entire Group to weight the risk and
return of global sustainability initiatives.
Reliance Companies’ Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") Committee
The Reliance Companies have an ESG Committee, chaired by the Chief Underwriting Officer of Reliance Standard
Life (RSL) and comprised of members from RSL’s Human Resources, Legal & Compliance, Marketing and
Communications, Finance, Risk Management and Sales departments. The ESG Committee has the primary
mandate to undertake and execute ESG initiatives supporting the Reliance Companies’ mission and strategic plan
in continuance of our ESG Strategy.
The ESG Committee will from time to time produce reports and share climate-related risk and opportunities in
the pursuit of the Reliance Companies’ ESG long-term goals, shared at the RSL Enterprise Risk Management
Committee (""ERMC""), which encompasses all of senior executive management of the Reliance Companies.
Board of Directors
TMHD's Board of Directors recognizes responding to climate change as a material management issue and
assumes the role of supervising Tokio Marine Holdings’ entire sustainability promotion scheme. The Board is
charged with discussion of Group sustainability policies including climate change countermeasures as well as
the evaluation and determination of mid-term and single-year plans. In monitoring the implementation status
of sustainability initiatives, it receives reports from the Sustainability Committee every quarter in principle and
provides instructions as necessary. In addition, the Board of Directors holds deliberation on corporate strategy
on the themes of the management environment and management issues, including climate action. Membership
includes outside directors and Audit/Supervisory Board members to fully utilize the knowledge available from
outside of TMHD.
‘At the Reliance Companies’ level, their intermediate parent company, Delphi Financial Group (Delphi), has
designated its Board of Directors as the body responsible for overseeing climate risks at its subsidiaries, including
the Reliance Companies. Delphi has also designated a member of its senior management; ie, its Senior Vice
President and Chief Risk Officer, as responsible for management of climate risks.
‘Compensation System for Directors and Executive Officers
In fiscal 2022, TM HD started incorporating non-financial indicators concerning the tasks on climate action and
other key issues in our sustainability strategy into the performance-linked compensation for Directors and
Executive Officers. TMHD uses the progress of each task toward our vision as an indicator, and after performing
the first assessment of compensation amounts at the Sustainability Committee, holds a deliberation and gives a
final decision at the Compensation Committee.
Organizational Structure for Promoting Sustainability
The TMHD Sustainability Division, CSUO, and Sustainability Committee are responsible for the promotion of
3

Group-wide initiatives and coordination with other subcommittees and task forces, which have dotted line
connections for support and input. Under this structure, TMHD aims to simultaneously achieve two goals:
* Specifically enhance the Group's social value by solving social issues through its business activities and
contributing to a sustainable society; and
+ Enhancing its economic value by achieving medium- to long-term growth for the Group through such
initiatives
The Group will realize medium- to long-term growth while promoting a shared understanding of the aims and
context of its mid- to long-term sustainability strategy throughout the Group and strengthen its initiatives to
solve issues relating to a sustainable earth and society. Please see page 11 of the 2022 Annual Sustainability
Report for a graphic of the Organizational Structure for Promoting Sustainability which includes (1) Role of the
Sustainability Committee as well as the (2) Roles of other organizations.

2. STRATEGY

Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's businesses,

strategy, and financial planning where such information is material. In disclosing the actual and potential impacts

of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's businesses, strategy and financial planning, insurers
should consider including the following:
* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and
resiliency.
+ Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its operations
of organizations.

‘A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium, and
long term. In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
medium, and longer term, insurers should consider including the following:

* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-Syears as short term, 5-10years as medium
term, and 10-30years as long term,

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business, strategy, and
financial_planning._In_describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
business, strategy, and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:

* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low carbon
economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
‘+ Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon economy,

C._ Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios,
including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

RESPONSE TO STRATEGY

In responding to climate change, which poses a global social issue critical to human history and important for the
Group, the Group promotes initiatives toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 in keeping with the promise
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As an insurance business operator (insurance products and services),
institutional investor and asset manager, the Group provides support both in terms of mitigating and adapting to
climate change and helps customers and investment and financing recipients solve their respective issues. Efforts
include providing insurance products and services to support the transition to a decarbonized society, such as
those promoting the more widespread use of renewable energy; providing insurance to cover damages caused by
natural disasters; services that will lead to prevention or reduction of damages; and undertaking sustainable
investment and financing.

‘As a global company, the Group intends to contribute to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change and

seek growth together with our stakeholders. Social contribution activities are also key to climate action. As

examples of such activities, the Group plants mangroves and engages in research and educational activities to
increase society's resilience, thereby contributing to climate action asa good corporate citizen in local communities
5

Recognition of Risks
‘The Group specifies climate change risk events by reflecting changes in the external and business environment
caused by the emergence of climate change, and identifies and assesses the impact on the Group. Climate-
related risks include risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (physical risks) and risks related to
the transition to a decarbonized society (transition risks).
Please see page 56 of the 2022 Annual Sustainability Report for a graphic depicting examples of Physical risks
and Transition risks for each risk category in the TCFD recommendations, as well as examples of risks from the
Group's business activities.
The Reliance Companies, as part of the Tokio Marine group, have a wide array of key ESG partners who we have
engaged to enhance our understanding of ESG risks and frameworks.
Under consideration of our ESG Committee we believe that reducing our companies’ environmental impact
and increasing climate awareness and education are desirable outcomes and that ensuring ethical operations
under principled and responsible leadership will lead to attracting and retaining team members who will
meaningfully contribute to the companies’ achieving their short- and long-term goals. The Reliance Companies
are in the process of reporting benchmark data to inform where there could be opportunities. While these plans
have not yet been made public, we will seek to be in a position to do so in the near future.
Policies Concerning Insurance Underwriting as well as Investment and Financing The Group's basic policy on
climate change is to support the de-carbonization of customers and local communities through insurance products
and services as well as investments and financing while basing our activities on constructive dialogue with
stakeholders. For investment and financing fields that could cause significant negative impacts on the environment or
society, the Group individually set up a policy on each transaction.
At the end of September 2020, TMHD published its thoughts on climate change in “Tokio Marine: Our Climate
Strategy,” which was revised at the end of September 2021 and the end of September 2022. In the statement,
TMHD commits itself to supporting the Group's clients and investees in the transition to a decarbonized society.

Investment and Financing
With respect to investment and financing, the Group will not provide new financing for coal-fired power
generation projects or thermal coal mining projects. As with the Group's insurance underwriting policy,
exceptions may be granted for projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS and
mixed combustion, after careful consideration, aiming to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
In aligning with our insurance underwriting policy, Tokio Marine Group is also no longer providing new financing
for oil and gas extraction projects in the Arctic Circle (all areas north of latitude 66°33, including the ANWR) and
oil sands mining and are stepping up our efforts to support the protection of the natural environment and
transition to a decarbonized society.

Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. TCFD Report2023 p22
The RSL ESG Committee, in furtherance of its ESG activities, including responding to climate change, will assess
the Reliance Companies’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 Green House Gas (""GHG"") emissions. Our first climate impact
report on GHG was issued in 2024 on 2022 data.
The Reliance Companies’ climate-related risk and opportunities over the short, medium and long-term can be
summarized as follows:

+ Short term (2023-2028): Focus on solidifying the mandate of the ESG Committee and set out the 2023
objectives to deliver on for Tokio Marine. Develop a reporting framework to measure the Reliance
Companies’ GHG emissions and define their carbon credit strategy (if determined to be necessary)

+ Medium term (2028-2038): Position the Reliance Companies to be designated as carbon neutral. Read
the final Climate Risk Guidance (which to a great extent remains subject to interpretation). Possibly
develop TCFD. Understand the various climate risk guidance/regulation that will become full in-effect.

‘+ Long Term (2038 and beyond): To be determined

The Reliance Companies will continue to analyze and determine the climate-related actions to implement in our
business operations, strategy and financial plans. The ESG committee will produce, as part of its existence,
climate strategies for executive management to consider and where appropriate implement.

In describing our resilience to climate-related scenarios, a 2-degree Celsius warming scenario would likely
increase the intensity of seasonal heat and humidity and may change the Reliance Companies’ strategy. Global
warming may lead to susceptibility to the growth of higher rates of human deaths and injuries, generally in the
geographic area of the United States. This in turn could lead to higher levels of losses in the companies’ Group
Life line of business (""GL"") with more heat related deaths for working populations. Similarly, higher levels of
injuries could lead to increases in claims in the companies’ Long-term and Short-term disability lines of business.
Since this scenario has not materialized to date, we may consider this with an increase in mortality assumptions
and model this as a possible scenario. In addition, a higher level of GL losses due to global warming could cause
Us to alter our reinsurance strategy to transfer higher levels of risk as necessary.

RESPONSE TO RISK MANAGEMENT

TMHD conducts enterprise risk management (ERM), which includes the management of climate risks. Through

the ERM cycle, TMHD comprehensively identifies and assesses risks, using both qualitative and quantitative

approaches (please see page 63 of the 2022 Annual Sustainability Report).

In the insurance business, which pursues profit through risk-taking, risk assessment is the foundation of the

Group's business. TMHD has been working for many years to assess material risks (including those due to

natural disasters) both quantitatively and qualitatively. Specific initiatives as part of the ERM Governance

Initiatives can be found on page 190 of the 2022 Annual Sustainability Report

8

(1) Qualitative Risk Management
TMHD identifies all forms of risk exhaustively, including natural disasters such as major storms and newly
emerging risks due to environmental changes. TMHD defines risks that will have an extremely large impact on
the Group's financial soundness and business continuity as “material risks.”
TMHD includes the risk of major windstorms and floods in the ""material risks” category, which could become
more frequent and severe due to the effects of climate change. TMHD also formulates control measures prior
to risk emergence and response measures for after risks occur.
(2) Quantitative Risk Management
For material risks, through measuring risk amounts and implementing stress tests as part of the TMHD’s
quantitative risk management, TMHD is able to perform a multifaceted review of the adequacy of capital
relative to the risks held for the purpose of maintaining ratings and preventing bankruptcy.
TMHD calculates risk amounts posed by natural disasters using a risk model (for Japan, a risk model
developed in-house based on engineering theory and the latest knowledge of natural disasters, and for
overseas, models provided by outside vendors). TMHD independently analyzes past tropical cyclones
(typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United States), torrential rains, and other changing trends and
incorporate this data as necessary in order to properly assess current weather phenomena
Furthermore, within material risks, TMHD conducts stress tests based on scenarios in which extreme economic
losses are expected and scenarios where multiple material risks occur at the same time. As for risks involving
major wind and flood disasters, for example, TMHD assumes these scenarios to be on a much larger scale than
the major typhoons that hit the Greater Tokyo Area in 2018 and 2019 causing extensive damages. TMHD
updates scenarios continuously while taking into account stress tests released by regulatory authorities of
every country, the latest knowledge (including that of climate change), and recent case studies.
Appropriately Control Risk through Risk Diversification and Reinsurance, etc.
Natural disasters are inevitable in Japan, the Group's home market. For that reason, TMHD has sought to
control risk capital by geographic, business, and product risk diversification through M&A overseas.
In addition, reinsurance, as a hedge against risk, is also an effective way to protect the Group's capital and
stabilize profits. The Group utilizes reinsurance to prepare for natural disasters (capital events) that occur once
every few centuries, and TMHD determines earnings coverage from the standpoint of economic rationality and
take necessary measures.
Acquisition of Knowledge (e.g., Industry-Academia Collaboration)
TMHD is deepening collaboration with both inside and outside experts to acquire knowledge about risks.
Tokio Marine Research Institute collaborates with The University of Tokyo, Nagoya University, and Kyoto
University, among others, to carry out impact analysis based on the possibility for increased insurance losses
associated with natural disasters that are becoming more severe in nature.

9

Moreover, Tokio Marine dR and a team of experts in natural disasters working in Atlanta, the United States, are
leading efforts to upgrade natural disaster risk management across the entire Group, including various
evaluations of natural disaster risk models.

Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. TCFD Report2023 p24, 25
Reliance Companies
In addition to the risk management activities conducted at the TMHD level, as described above, the Reliance
Companies have established an ESG Committee, which will from time to time produce reports and share climate-
related risk and opportunities in the pursuit of the Reliance Companies’ ESG long-term goals, which it will report
to the RSL Enterprise Risk Management Committee.
The Reliance Companies’ intermediate parent, Delphi Financial Group (Delphi), has designated its Board of
Directors as the body responsible for overseeing climate risks at its subsidiaries, including the Reliance
Companies. Delphi has also designated a member of its senior management; ie, its Senior Vice President and
Chief Risk Officer, as responsible for management of climate risks, with whom information reported at the
Reliance Companies’ level will be shared and who will, in turn, report such information to Delphi's Board.
Delphi has incorporated climate risk into its risk management policy in addition to its investment guidelines
(which govern the investments of the Reliance Companies), and has initiated a plan to manage climate risks
through existing enterprise risk management functions, including risk assessment, compliance, internal control,
internal audit, and actuarial functions.

GHGEmissions

Emissions Associated with the Group's Business Activities and Achieving Carbon Neutrality

Each Tokio Marine Group company is working to reduce the environmental impact associated with
its business activities, and at the same time, aims to achieve carbon neutrality on a global basis, in
which the amount of GHG fixed and reduced through mangrove planting and the use of natural
energy exceeds GHG (CO.) emissions from business activities.

Achieving Carbon Neutrality in Fiscal 2021
Reduction of GHG (CO2) emissions from Tokio Marine Group operations"": 83,483 tons (32% reduction vs
2015)

+ (Scope 1:13,022 tons; Scope 2: 47,435 tons; Scope 3”:

23,026 tons) Amount of GHG(CO2) Fixed and Reduced:130,003 tons
Tokio Marine Group is working to reduce the environmental impact of the overall Group (domestic and
overseas)
and become carbon neutral by 1) conserving energy and using energy more efficiently, 2)
planting mangroves to absorb and fix CO2, 3) using natural energy (such as by procuring green electricity)
and 4) amortizing carbon credits. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2021 we achieved carbon neutrality
for the ninth consecutive year (since fiscal 2013) thanks to absorption and fixation effects of mangrove
planting and the use of carbon credits outperforming the CO2 emissions generated by the Group's overall
business activities. The value of ecosystem services generated through the Mangrove Planting Project over
the past 20 years (from April 1999 to the end of March 2019) has reached approximately 118.5 billion yen.
We expect the value to climb to 391.2 billion yen by the end of fiscal 2038 As of March 31, 2023, we have
planted a total area of 12,261 hectares of mangrove forest.

TCFD-ALIGNED QUESTIONS
UPDATED 2022
GOVERNANCE
1. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
In disclosing the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities insurers should consider
including the following:
* Identify and include any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and opportunities.
* Describe where climate-related disclosure is handled within the insurer’s structure, e.g., at a group level,
entity level, or a combination. If handled at the group level, describe what activities are undertaken at the

climate-related financial risks.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Company's climate-related disclosure is handled at the entity level. The Company's board of Directors,
together with the Audit, Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board (AFRM) are responsible for
oversight of climate-related risks. The Board appointed Amy Basel, CPA, CGMA, as the Director accountable for
the Company's assessment and management of the financial risks from climate change. The Board also
appointed Jessica Kenworthy, the Company's chief risk officer, as the executive staff member accountable for
climate-related risks. Kenworthy is responsible for assessing and reporting to the board on climate-related
risks, and for embedding climate risks into the Company's risk management framework. Basel is accountable
for ensuring timely reporting to both the Board and AFRM Committee on said risks and for ensuring the current
and forward- looking impact of climate related factors are considered when making business decisions.
STRATEGY
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.

Chief Risk Officer works with the identified risk owners (i.e. those responsible for the oversight of climate risk
as it pertains to their functional areas) to incorporate ongoing assessment and quantification of climate risks
affecting the Company. The Company incorporates into its assessment of strategic initiatives the
identification of opportunities to reduce and/or mitigate green gas emissions stemming from the Company's
‘operations. The Company has already taken steps to reduce emissions by converting to a significantly remote
work environment and promoting use of electronic materials where possible to reduce paper use and
printing, including recently migrating all group customers from paper to electronic invoices and brokers to
electronic statements. Note that the Company offers group dental, vision, life, and disability and individual
dental and vision insurance products and services, which do not carry an inherently material level of climate-
related insurance risk.

* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-tisk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.

'* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.
The Company's ERM program serves as the foundation for ensuring all known and emerging
risks are periodically assessed and that appropriate action plans are in place to manage those
risks, including climate-related risks. The ERM process is an ongoing cycle that involves several
key principles: (a) identifying the risks; (b) assessing, analyzing, and quantifying the risks; (c)
creating controls to mitigate the risk; (d) reporting risks to committees, executive leadership
and the board; and (e) monitoring the risk and the controls.
As part of the overall ERM program, the Company assesses and monitors each of the following
potential climate-related exposures, which have been deemed most relevant to the Company's,
risk profile:
a) Climate-related events adversely impacting Company assets, operational expenses, or
reputational risks (“Operational Risk”);
b) Climate events, trends or scenarios adversely impacting insurer’s competitive or
financial position (“Strategic Risk”);
©) Climate risks or perceived risks of credits impact the values or liquidity of current or
future investments (Investment & Liquidity Risk”);
d) Potential impact of climate change and associated risks on specified customer sectors
(“Pricing & Underwriting Risk”);
e) Reinsurer’s exposure to physical & transition risks (“Credit Risk”); and
) Litigation risk for failing to adapt to climate change or to avoid/minimize adverse
impacts on the environment (“Legal Risk”).
The risk assessment process is a continuous interrelated process of annual surveys, interviews,
and discussions to identify the risk areas with the highest potential impact on the mission,
goals, and objectives of the leader's respective area, as well as the effectiveness of existing
internal controls employed to mitigate the risks identified. Surveys are also used to help assess
the risks, including climate-related risks, in terms of likelihood (the likelihood of an event
occurring) and impact (the significance or impact the occurrence could have on the business’
ability to achieve its goals).
Executive leadership, with input from the Board of Directors, identifies risk limits, risk
tolerance, and risk appetite. Items including, but not limited to, (1) overall net assets; (2) net
income; (3) ability to absorb recurring issues; and (4) impact on strategic plan are used to
determine risk limits, tolerance, and appetite. Results are compared against risk limits,
appetite, and tolerance.
To ensure risks remain current, the Company utilizes various methods to collect risk and
data/information including but not limited to: in-person interviews and workshops, electronic
surveys, management meetings, quarterly risk management committee meetings, quarterly
compliance committee meetings, quarterly data privacy meetings, and the meetings of the
audit committee of the Board of Directors to continuously re-evaluate and assess risks and risk
tolerance, as well as to track emerging risks.

+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what
timeframes are considered.

The Company's direct exposure to underwriting risk related to physical climate risks is very
limited, as it underwrites only group dental, vision, life and disability and individual dental and

vision products. The Company monitors the geographic concentration of groups with potential
physical climate risk for its group life and disability blocks. The Company also has limited its
exposure to sectors with inherently high levels of transition climate risk (gas, oil, mining,
chemicals, etc) in its life and disability blocks, as those sectors comprise less than 5% of the
block.

As an additional mitigation, the Company underwrites its business almost entirely on a 1-year
contractual basis. Subsequently, the Company addresses potential climate-related risk
exposure on 1-year time horizons at each point of renewal or new sale. If the risk environment
were to change, the Company would have the opportunity to respond to those changes at least
annually.

+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.

The Company has a formal process that incorporates consideration of ESG, including climate-
related risks, in its investment management process. A Responsible Investing working group
was created June 2020 and created the Company's Policy on Responsible Investing. The
‘Company holds an ESG discussion in its weekly Capital Structure meetings and incorporates ESG
analysis in its credit review process as well. The analysis is based off of five metrics:

+ ISS Quality Score: Company Governance Assessment

+ S&P Global Rank: Corporate Sustainability Assessment

+ Sustainalytics Rank: Industry Peer Comparison

+ Bloomberg Disclosure Score: Disclosed ESG Data

+ MSCI Rating: Overall ESG rating (AAA ~ CCC)
An overall ESG score is determined based on sector specific weighting and rank and the score is
utilized in the overall credit score.
The Company's investment portfolio has very little exposure to climate-related counterparty
credit risks, as the majority of the Company's invested assets are in cash and cash equivalents
and government securities.

+ Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting
portfolio, and how the Company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to physical,

Based upon the current assessment of each of the primary risk owners, the Company does not have a material
level of exposure to climate-related risks. The Company monitors geographic location of life and disability
policies, including any concentration of life and disability policies in areas prone to natural disasters, such as
coastal areas. For both the life and disability lines, the Company has limited exposure to specific NAICS codes
that inherently have a higher level of potential exposure to climate-related risks, specifically transition risk,
and has limited exposure to those sectors to less than 5% of the block.
‘The Company has a reinsurance agreement in place with RGA, on the excess of retention for both group life and group
LTD policies. The reinsurance arrangement is assessed annually for disability and bi-annually for life, whereby the
company could terminate the agreement if there were any significant climate-related counterparty with the
reinsurance partner

B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Response to Governance The Company's Enterprise Risk Management Program (ERM) is led by the Risk
Management Committee (RMC) whose membership includes Chief Compliance
Officer (CCO-Chair), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Underwriting Officer (CUO),
and General Counsel (GC). The Company's Risk Management Committee is
responsible for oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities along with all
other risks. The Company's RMC reports to the CEO, provides leadership/oversight
of EIC’ s Enterprise Risk Management Framework, initiatives, mitigations,
implements risk metrics, monitors results and provides bi-annual reports to the
Audit Committee (AC). The Company's ERM program consists of five pillars which
the company has identified as critical risk areas: Underwriting, CAT Management,
Regulatory & Compliance, Financial Management and Operations Management. Each
pillar is led by a business subject matter expert who proactively identifies,
quantifies, measures and implements effective mitigations. Pillar updates include
status on top risks and emerging risks with proposed mitigation plans. Risks are
analyzed based on the likelihood of occurrence in years (Probability Analysis) and
the magnitude of impact as a % of surplus after tax (Severity Analysis). The RMC
meets quarterly, or on an as needed basis and provides bi-annual reports to the
Audit Committee. All relevant risk issues are escalated to senior leadership as per
Company's Governance structure (Pillar Leaders - RMC ~ Audit Committee-Board of
Directors). Specific to climate-related risks and opportunities, the Company
considers potential risk to losses, policyholder’s perspective, investments, and its
‘own carbon footprint.

B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Response:
Rock Ridge Insurance Company (the “Company,” “we,” or “our”), a Texas-domiciled insurance company, does
not have any publicly stated goals related to climate-related risks and opportunities at this time. However,
climate risk is considered an emerging risk area in our overall Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program.
Our ERM is a critical and continual process, and emerging risks are a crucial part of that effort. Climate
change, including its financial implications, is one of many risks we assess and manage regularly. When
appropriate, it may result in specific actions in the future as necessary and feasible.
The Company will continue to work on implementing a strategic approach to managing climate risks that
consider both current and forward-looking risks and identify actions required to manage those risks
proportionate to our business's nature, scale, and complexity.
The Company has a Risk Committee at the holding company level that focuses on identifying, managing, and
minimizing risk both from internal operations and external with our various insurance programs and
partners. This is done with continual assessment and identification of current and emerging risks,
maintenance of an ERM program with a comprehensive risk register and using dedicated internal risk-
focused personnel. The Company's Board of Directors at the holding company level is discussing designating
the Chief Risk Officer who would be responsible for the Company's climate risk management, overseeing the
financial impact of climate risks, reporting any activity to the Executive Committee at least annually, and
developing policies regarding risk appetite for the Company.
The Risk Committee reports its continued assessment and management of climate-related risks and
opportunities to management. Management reviews the comprehensive risk register at least annually for
their specific department for any necessary updates.

METRICS AND TARGETS

4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material.

In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:

'* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your
business. Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to assess, if
any.

Company Response: Given the volatility of CAT events and the changing risk environment, historical
CAT data may not always be indicative of future events. Therefore, pricing strategies need to not only
assess the likelihood and severity of past events but also forecast the likelihood and severity of future
events. Furthermore, pricing should evaluate catastrophes at a granular level, recognizing that certain
risks, such as those located in coastal areas and flood zones, are more susceptible to CAT events.
When evaluating prices by state, Root adjusts historical Comprehensive coverage data to account for
expected CAT risk. This adjustment considers industry data, competitor rate filings, and Root's internal
claims data. As a result of this analysis, Root sets prices based on a higher expectation of CAT events in
hurricane-prone states than what would be suggested by internal data alone. The Actuarial team
continues to monitor trends in CAT events to ensure that pricing accurately reflects the anticipated
future occurrence of CAT events at both an overall and detailed level.

A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process.

In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:

‘* In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate
scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the
amount of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.

Company Response: CAT risk perils: Earthquake, Hurricane, Severe Thunderstorm, Winter Storm and
Inland Flood are modeled using standard industry softwares that output Average Annual Loss, entire
Aggregate Exceedance Probability curve for Root's exposure. When evaluating risk exposures, Root
primarily focuses on 1in 100 years or 1 in 250 years scenario loss amount.

When evaluating prices by state, Root adjusts historical Comprehensive coverage data to account for
expected CAT risk. This adjustment considers industry data, competitor rate filings, and Root's internal
claims data. As a result of this analysis, Root sets prices based on a higher expectation of CAT events in
hurricane-prone states than what would be suggested by internal data alone.

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the

to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related physical risks [answer in absolute amounts
and percentages if possible], alignment with climate scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR,
carbon intensity], and the amount of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against
targets.
RESPONSE:
See Governance Response Above. As the Society does not currently consider climate related risks a significant risk to its life and
annuity business, it has not undertaken any modeling or stress testing to create metrics or targets related to potential climate
change impacts.

2023,2023_SELECTIVE INS .pdf,"INTRODUCTION
Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (“Selective,” “we,” “us,” or “our’) is a New Jersey insurance
holding company incorporated in 1977 that owns ten property and casualty insurance
subsidiaries (""Insurance Subsidiaries""). The Insurance Subsidiaries sell products and
services only in the United States (""U.S."") and exclusively through independent insurance
agents and wholesale brokers.
We have four reportable segments, each potentially impacted by climate-related risks or
events:
Standard Commercial Lines: This segment's underwriting risk appetite is focused on
small-to-medium sized accounts, with risks weighted more towards low- to medium-hazard
than high-hazard. Standard Commercial Lines provides insurance products and services to
commercial enterprises, typically businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government
agencies. This business represented 73% of ""Total revenues’ in 2023.
Standard Personal Lines: This segment provides insurance products and services to
individuals (primarily auto and homeowners insurance) acquiring coverage in the standard
marketplace. This business represented 9% of our “Total revenues"" in 2023. Our Personal
Lines segment also includes flood insurance coverage sold through the Write Your Own
(‘WY0"") program of the National Flood Insurance Program (""NFIP""). Based on 2023 direct
premiums written, we are the fourth-largest writer of this coverage through the NFIP.
Excess and Surplus Lines (""E&S”): This segment comprises commercial property and
casualty insurance products and services provided to customers unable to obtain coverage
in the standard marketplace, generally because of unusual or higher-risk exposures. This
business represented 9% of “Total revenues’ in 2023.
Investments: This segment represents 9% (including net realized and unrealized gains and
losses) of “Total revenues” and invests the (i) premiums our Insurance Subsidiaries collect
and (i) amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which include the
issuance of debt and equity securities.

OVERVIEW OF OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING CLIMATE RISKS.
Our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard Personal Lines, and E&S segments issue
policies that cover thousands of individuals and businesses against the financial impact of
insured losses, including catastrophic events. We support economic growth by providing our

1

policyholders the contingent capital that gives them the peace of mind and confidence to
take economic risk and protect them and their communities.
Changing climate conditions increase the unpredictability of weather-related loss frequency
and severity, posing a long-term risk to our customers’ lives and livelihoods — and our
business. We aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change by (i) prudently overseeing and
managing catastrophe risk exposure, (ii) helping our customers through responsive claims
handling, risk management services, and proactive weather alerts, (iii) preparing for the
continuing transition to clean energy, and (iv) reducing our carbon footprint. Understanding
and helping mitigate climate change perils for our business and customers is core to our
operations and strategy.
Our understanding of changing climate conditions permits us to develop products and
services that increase customer resiliency and respond to evolving customer needs.
Over the medium- to long-term, we believe that the economic transition to a low-carbon
future creates new business opportunities in emerging industries, such as those associated
with renewable energy and related construction projects.
Our Investments segment incorporates sustainability considerations into our robust
investment due diligence processes. To establish appropriate sustainability investment
governance, we maintain (i) a well-diversified portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset
classes and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and
maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. In addition, we work
with our third-party investment managers to ensure they incorporate sustainability guidelines
and protocols into their investment process while managing our mandates.
We believe our climate change-related efforts (i) demonstrate our corporate responsibility to
help mitigate the impact of climate change and (ii) reward our shareholders with sustained
superior financial and operating performance over time.
We have embraced the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) for the four core elements of an organization's climate approach: (i)
Governance, (ii) Strategy, (iii) Risk Management, and (iv) Metrics & Targets. This report
outlines our initiatives and progress in each of these areas.
Governance
Board Oversight: Our board's oversight of climate-related risks and
opportunities.
Our Board of Directors oversees our Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM"") process, which
includes identifying, assessing, and managing risks related to climate change. The Board
has six standing committees that oversee and report to the full Board on certain major risks,
2

including climate risk. Our Board's Risk Committee meets at least quarterly and is
responsible for helping the Board oversee and monitor our ERM function, including climate
change-related risks and oversight of our reinsurance program.
All Board committees oversee risks specific to their supervisory areas, and report their
activities and findings to the entire Board. For example, the Finance and Investments
Committee oversees management's incorporation of Environmental, Social, and
Governance (“ESG"") considerations into their due diligence and investment decision-making
process; and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (""“CGNC"") oversees
how management addresses sustainability trends.
The Board also oversees how we set our overall strategy, including monitoring and
addressing climate risks and opportunities.
Management: Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related
risks and opportunities.
Our senior leadership team implements our strategy, including assessing and pursuing
climate change-related business opportunities. The Executive Risk Committee (""ERC""),
chaired by our Chief Risk Officer (‘CRO’), is responsible for operational oversight of climate-
related risks. The ERM unit is responsible for assessing and managing climate change-
related financial risks. We describe the roles of the ERC and ERM unit below.
Executive Risk Committee:
Our ERC, which includes our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), his direct reports, the CRO,
and other key functional leaders, provides management oversight of the ERM function. The
ERC is responsible for the holistic evaluation and supervision of our risk profile and
determines future risk management actions supporting our overall risk appetite. Several
other management committees are responsible for the detailed analysis and management of
various individual risks, some of which are climate related. At least quarterly, the ERC
reviews all major risks.
For example, the ERM unit reports our modeled results for hurricane losses (our peak
catastrophe risk peril in more severe loss scenarios), gross and net of reinsurance in our
quarterly Reinsurance Risk Scorecard provided to the ERC and Board's Risk Committee.
ERM Unit:
The ERM unit, led by the CRO, is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and
reporting key individual and aggregated enterprise-wide risks. The CRO chairs the Emerging
Risk Committee and Market Security Committee (""MSC"") and is a member of the
Management Investment Committee (“MIC’), the Large Claims Committee, and the
Underwriting Committee. The CRO attends the quarterly Reserve Committee presentation,
3

quarterly Disclosure Committee meetings, and various other senior management leadership
meetings. These management committees and functions are responsible for monitoring
various risks, including climate-related risks, described further in this report's Risk
Management section.
The ERM unit is actively involved in climate-related issues, such as catastrophe exposure
coverages and pricing. The ERM unit also manages our economic capital model and
integrates catastrophe exposure into our holistic view of enterprise risk and capital
management.
The Graph below illustrates our three levels of corporate governance of Enterprise Risk
Management:

Compensation and Human Capital Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee, Finance and Investments Committee, and Risk Committee.

Climate Risks
1. Increased model uncertainty around severe weather events resulting from
potentially higher catastrophe loss activity (short-term)
The insurance industry has used traditional catastrophe risk models for decades to
inform underwriting strategy. A significant component of climate risk is that the frequency
and severity of extreme weather events may evolve differently than historical levels —
leading to increased model uncertainty. Our third-party modeling providers are starting to
develop models incorporating forward-looking climate variables. Later in this report we
discuss how we mitigate this uncertainty.
5

2. Potential investment losses from climate risk-related impacts (medium-
term)
We maintain (i) a well-diversified investment portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset
classes and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and
maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. Our investment
portfolio is exposed to climate change risk through (i) direct physical loss to assets and
infrastructure from catastrophic loss activity and (ji) transition risk related to technology
and energy production advances that could lead to stranded assets in certain carbon-
intensive sectors.
Physical investment risks: Climate-related catastrophic losses can cause business
disruption, destroy capital, increase costs to recover from disasters, reduce revenue,
and cause population displacement and migration. These, in turn, can lead to lower
residential and commercial property values, household wealth, and corporate
profitability, which can create financial and credit market losses impacting insurer asset
values.
Transition investment risks: These arise from society's transition towards a low-carbon
economy, driven by policy and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, and
shifting sentiment and societal preferences. This transition towards renewable energy
sources may lead to stranded assets in areas such as the fossil fuel and automotive
industries. Further, it could result in higher infrastructure reinvestment and replacement
costs and increased litigation against carbon-intensive industries. Transition risks may
lead to corporate asset devaluation and lower corporate profitability, property values,
and household wealth, creating financial and credit market losses impacting insurer
asset values.

3. Insurance market transition risk (medium-term)
Increased climate-related regulations and evolving consumer preferences could change
manufacturing and construction methods. As an insurer of small- and mid-sized
businesses in the construction, mercantile, and manufacturing sectors, we could
‘experience reduced demand for specific products. While we have minimal direct
underwriting exposure to environmentally hazardous classes of business, changing
societal preferences and climate change regulations may impact our customers.

4, Regulatory risk (medium-term)
Insurance regulations could limit our flexibility in reducing exposure to certain lines of
business most vulnerable to climate change. While our Personal Lines segment

6

represented 9% of “Total revenues” in 2023, it is subject to significant state regulation,
that limits our flexibility to exit lines quickly if results meaningfully deteriorate. We also
may not receive regulatory approvals for adequate rate levels reflecting catastrophe loss
‘exposure within our products. There is also a risk of expanded climate-related state and
federal disclosure requirements.

5. Climate change impact on frequency and severity of weather events (long-
term)
The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) is an
international body responsible for assessing climate change science. In 2021, the IPCC
estimated in its “Sixth Assessment Report: Physical Science Basis” that human activities
(i) have caused approximately 1.1°C of global warming to date above pre-industrial
levels and (ii) this could rise to an increase between 1.2°C and 3.0°C above pre-
industrial levels between 2041 and 2060. Climate change models also project significant
differences in global regional warming above pre-industrial levels, depending on future
levels of climate mitigation and geographic location. These global regional differences,
whether attributable to nature or human activities, include increases in (i) mean
temperature in most land and ocean regions, (ii) hot extremes in most inhabited regions,
(ii) heavy precipitation in several regions, and (iv) the probability of drought and
precipitation deficits in some regions. These temperature changes can impact weather
patterns and the frequency and/or severity of catastrophes, including hurricanes,
wildfires, severe convective storms, and flooding — all of which could cause our
catastrophe losses to increase relative to historical levels.

6. Reinsurance risk (long-term)
The availability, quality, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions,
including traditional privately placed reinsurance, retrocessional reinsurance, and
catastrophe bond market capacity. Most of our reinsurance contracts have annual terms.
Consequently, reinsurance costs may fluctuate significantly, not necessarily correlating
to the loss experience of our specific book of business. State insurance regulators
generally permit us to consider catastrophe reinsurance expense in our filed rates and
rating plans. However, the conditions and timing of regulatory approval may not align
with the actual expense of new reinsurance terms. Disproportionate increases in our
reinsurance expense that we cannot include in our filed rates and rating plans will
reduce our earings. If we cannot negotiate desired reinsurance amounts or terms, we
may experience increased reinsurance expense and increased risk retention on
individual or aggregate claim losses that could limit our ability to write future business.

Climate Opportunities

1. Producing renewable energy (short-term)
Selective strongly believes in a clean energy future. We built ground-mount and garage-
canopy solar photovoltaic facilities at our corporate headquarters. The facilities can
generate approximately five million kWh of electricity annually, and we sell the related
solar renewable energy credits to others. As we sell these solar renewable energy
credits to others, our GHG emissions are not offset — but we are invested in cleaner
energy production.

2. Enhancing customer resiliency (short-term)
Helping our customers prepare for severe weather events mitigates loss activity.
Examples include proactive messaging and outreach before catastrophic weather events
and risk management services, including risk evaluations, internet-based risk
management educational resources, and thermographic infrared surveys that help
strengthen our customer relationships. We are also evaluating value-added services and
technologies within our Standard Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments to
enhance customer resiliency, such as our newly rolled out Risk Management Center
found on our website and our partnerships with LeakBot and Phyn for intelligent water
solutions.

3. Providing products and services to lower customers’ carbon footprint
(short-term)
We recognize that customer demand for climate-friendly products and services may
increase, and we see opportunities to provide these services to our customers. We
describe programs we have implemented in the Impact of Risks and Opportunities on
Businesses, Strategy, and Financial Planning section below.

4, Investment Opportunities (short-term)
Selective currently invests in green bonds and energy-transition-related infrastructure
instruments. In addition, we invest in tax credit transactions that help encourage the
installation of solar energy systems.

5. Developing new insurance products tailored to emerging industries
(medium-term)
As part of an economic transition to a low-carbon future, we expect new technologies,
infrastructure, and processes to be introduced — all of which will require insurance

8

coverage. We believe that, over time, this will present a sizeable business opportunity. In
the following sections, we describe how new product development is a component of our
business strategy.
6. Additional investment opportunities (long-term)
We believe the transition to a low-carbon economy will provide new investment
‘opportunities, such as green bonds or investments in energy-transition-related
infrastructure instruments. These investment opportunities could increase our
diversification of financial assets. As the clean energy sector grows and matures, we
‘expect to continue to invest in new assets that support the transition to a low-carbon
‘economy.
Impact of Risks and Opportunities on Businesses, Strategy, and Financial
Planning: The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our
businesses, strategy, and financial planning.
The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our underwriting and investment
segments follows.
Underwriting
The principal impact of climate change on our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard
Personal Lines, and E&S business is the potential for greater frequency and/or severity of
insured property catastrophic loss activity.
Catastrophe Risk Management
The ERM function models and monitors catastrophe risk, including the ongoing assessment
of catastrophe risks within our pre-determined limits. Our underwriting and risk management
frameworks employ risk mitigation tools, including:
1. Comprehensive underwriting standards;
2. Limits on coastal property exposure;
3. Risk-sharing through (a) use of appropriate wind/weather-related deductibles, and
(b) prudent reinsurance placements with high-quality third parties;
4. Modeling and managing our catastrophe risk aggregations; and
5. Active oversight from senior management and the Board of Directors.

Due to our business risk profile and geographic concentration in the Northeast and Mid-
Atlantic states, hurricane risk is our portfolio’s most significant natural catastrophe peril
‘exposure. This risk influenced our decision to diversify our underwriting portfolio
geographically and set rigorous coastal property exposure guidelines. The following
depiction of our property writings in 2002, 2012, and 2023 shows our book's geographical
diversification as we have grown the business.
The table below illustrates results of our efforts to diversify our premium geographically.

We review our hurricane risk exposure using third-party vendor models and conducting our
proprietary analysis. The third-party vendor models provide a long-term view that closely
relates modeled event frequency to historical hurricane activity. However, climate change
may cause hurricane frequency and severity to differ from historical levels. In the short- to
medium-term, we mitigate this risk by purchasing significant reinsurance protection and
setting our retained loss thresholds at levels well below the amounts we believe would
cause significant financial stress. In the medium- to longer-term, we expect to continually
evolve our risk modeling and stress thresholds based on scientific and modeling advances.
We incorporate these modeled catastrophe loss expectations within our pricing plans and
have underwriting guidelines reflecting our catastrophe exposure appetite. Modeled results
are reported to the MSC and impact our reinsurance purchasing and strategic growth
decisions.
10

In addition to managing our peak hurricane exposure risk, we seek to manage our
‘exposures to other perils, such as severe convective storms, winter storms, flooding, and
wildfires. By building a geographically diverse book of business, implementing strong
underwriting guidelines, conducting risk modeling, and purchasing reinsurance, we seek to
manage our exposure to these types of losses.

In our standard commercial lines segment, we look to our insureds to retain an appropriate
level of risk in wind/hail exposure states to severe convective storms through the use of
wind/hail deductibles and use of endorsements that put limitations on coverage for roof
surfacing including for cosmetic damage or determining roof surfacing values on an actual
cash value basis. In our Personal Lines segment, we implement mandatory wind/hail
deductibles in states exposed to severe convective storms, where allowed by law.
Opportunities

In the short term, we have several initiatives aimed at helping customers lower their carbon
footprint and increase their resiliency to catastrophic losses.

+ We send messages to our customers, helping them prepare for severe weather
events. For example, we send weather preparation notices for large storms or
hurricanes, including guides on structural improvements, roof and drainage
maintenance, and measures to prevent clogged or frozen plumbing and sprinkler
systems.

+ Our field-based Risk Management Specialists visit the business locations of certain
current and potential commercial lines customers to conduct safety evaluations. Risk
Management staff provide risk mitigation recommendations to improve worker safety
and limit potential property losses, such as from flood, wind, or fire.

+ We are a member company that supports the Insurance Institute for Business &
Home Safety (“IBHS"") and regularly leverage its research to help our customers,
distribution partners, and internal staff further their knowledge to mitigate severe
weather losses. We have in person events as well as a library of training courses
available.

+ Our GreenPAC® endorsement allows Commercial Lines policyholders (within the
coverage limits) to repair or replace covered loss property damage using building
materials, components, products, equipment, construction and design methods, and
technologies that reduce environmental impact by conserving energy, water, and
other natural resources.

+ We have enhanced our commercial Automobile ElitePac® coverage form to include
a green automobile replacement coverage. Similar to our GreenPAC® commercial

1

property endorsement, this coverage permits policyholders to replace their insured
auto after a total loss with a hybrid or electric vehicle within the coverage limits.

+ We are assessing the incorporation of value-added services within our Commercial
Lines, Personal Lines, and Flood operations that will better prepare our customers
for potentially heightened environmental and climate risks. In 2024, we launched our
new Risk Management Center in the MySelective app and on our website for
Commercial Lines customers, which features online assessments, expert support,
and on-demand training. The Risk Management Center allows us to more broadly
provide resources to insureds.

In the medium-term, we continue to actively evaluate modifications to our existing coverages
and increase our product suite to match our expected new areas of insurance coverage
demand. As a significant writer of contractors and small manufacturing risks, we believe
Selective is well-positioned to support growing market share opportunities from new low-
carbon construction processes. Providing insurance capacity to renewable energy
production facilities and related construction projects would be a longer-term growth
opportunity.
Investments
Our investment portfolio is exposed to climate change risk through (i) direct physical loss to
assets and infrastructure from catastrophic loss activity and (ii) transition risk related to
technology and energy production advances that could lead to stranded assets in certain
carbon-intensive sectors.
Physical risks: Our investment managers take a conservative approach when investing in
commercial and residential real estate products that are potentially vulnerable to climate
change-related risks. As of December 31, 2023, around 70% of our residential mortgage-
backed securities were government agency-backed. We generally invest in the top tranches
of commercial mortgage-backed securities, with ample support to protect against losses
from property value declines.
Transition risk: We also monitor our exposure to specific carbon-intensive sectors defined
by the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) as vulnerable to longer-
term climate change transition risks. As of December 31, 2023, sectors we identified in our
corporate fixed income portfolio as carbon-intensive represented less than 5% of our total
invested assets. The identified sectors and their associated percentage of invested assets
are Automotive (0.4%), Aviation (0.6%), Cement (0.0%), Coal Mining (0.0%), Oil and Gas
(1.5%), Power Generation (1.6%), Shipping (0.0%), and Steel (0.1%).

Integrating ESG into our Investment Process:
We incorporate ESG considerations into our investment process. To establish appropriate
ESG investment governance, we work with our third-party investment managers to ensure
they have ESG guidelines and protocols in their investment process while managing our
mandates.
We also are not making any new direct debt or equity investments in thermal coal
enterprises, including companies that generate 30% or more of (i) their revenue from the
‘ownership, exploration, mining, or refining of thermal coal or (ii) their electricity generation
from thermal coal.
Resilience of Strategy Considering Climate-Related Scenarios: The resilience
of our strategy taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios,
including a 2°C or lower scenario.
Evaluating perils with different return periods is crucial to identifying, assessing, and
managing climate-related risks that influence our business strategy. Modeled estimates
provide a range of potential outcomes. We review multiple models from various vendors
over several time periods to understand our catastrophic risk, including physical risks that
may materialize more frequently because of climate change. We manage our catastrophe
risk conservatively, adjusting third-party vendor models to reflect assumptions for certain un-
13

modeled costs, such as the impact of loss expenses, residual market assessments, and
automobile-related losses.
Our current catastrophe reinsurance program exhausts at approximately a 1-in-260-year
return period. As of December 31, 2023, we estimated net exposure to a 1-in-250-year
(0.4% probability of exceedance) hurricane event to equal 4% of our GAAP equity, within our
established risk tolerance and unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

We assess the resilience of our strategy to mitigate climate-related risks quantitatively,
through natural catastrophe modeling, and qualitatively. Based on our assessment, we are
more vulnerable to physical climate risks than transitional risks. Accordingly, more severe
warming scenarios will likely increase catastrophe risk. Our primary exposure to transitional
risk is through our investment portfolio, where the percentage of fixed income assets
invested in carbon-intensive sectors was less than 5% of total assets as of December 31,
2023.
Our mix of business and underwriting approach has historically resulted in less of an impact
from catastrophe losses than the P&C insurance industry average (shown in the graph
14

below). We will continue to evaluate climate scenario analysis as a tool to complement our
catastrophe risk scenario analysis as industry guidance and models evolve.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Processes for Identifying and Assessing Climate-related Risks: Our processes
for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
Selective has a robust ERM framework that includes identifying and assessing our most,
significant risks through a combination of quantitative analysis and metrics and qualitative
assessment. Our ERM unit identifies and assesses physical, transition, and liability risks
related to climate change.
Our ERM framework includes an emerging risk management component led by a
designated Emerging Risk Committee. This committee identifies and monitors new and
evolving risk issues that may significantly impact our financial performance, reputation, or
long-term strategy. The Emerging Risk Committee has identified climate change as a “high”
level emerging risk, reviewing it at least quarterly with the ERC and our Board's Risk
Committee. The ERM unit, the ERC, and other specific employees stay informed on key
15

climate change risk developments through industry publications, webinars, conferences, and
regular engagement with outside sources, such as our reinsurance brokers, investment
managers, and trade associations.
The ERM unit evaluates our catastrophe risk exposure relative to our established
tolerances. This evaluation incorporates the results of third-party vendor models and
proprietary analysis in its review of exposure to hurricanes and other perils on both a gross
and net basis.
The table below shows the gross and net losses modeled results by peril of our underwriting
property portfolio as of July 1, 2023, The table highlights hurricane peril as our most
significant natural catastrophe exposure, driving the more significant events, or “tail,” of our
modeled catastrophe loss distribution.

+ Net losses are after-tax loses net of catastrophe reinsurance treaty, effective Jonuary 1, 2024, including reinstatement premiums.
We currently do not write crop insurance, have minimal exposure to private flood, and have
a small geographic footprint in the Western U.S., so our exposures to perils such as
droughts, wildfires, and flooding, tend to be relatively modest.
On the investment side, we monitor our exposure to carbon-intensive industries to measure
our vulnerability to climate-related risks from the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Processes for Managing Climate-related Risks: Our processes for managing
climate-related risks.
Underwriting
In managing physical climate-related risks to our insurance business, we model our property
portfolio for hurricanes and other wind events semi-annually, as of July and January.
Earthquake risk, which presents significantly lower exposure for our portfolio, is modeled
each July.
16

Annually, our Reinsurance team works closely with our reinsurance broker to produce an in-
depth analysis of the modeled results, which the MSC reviews.
We use various authority levels as underwriting controls for significant individual property
risks and large property accounts that could create or exacerbate a property aggregation
issue. If any individual location exceeds the Chief Underwriting Officer's property limit
authority, it must be approved by the Underwriting Committee (comprised of the Standard
Lines Chief Operating Officer, CFO, Standard Commercial Lines Chief Underwriting Officer,
Executive Vice President of E&S Lines, and CRO). When considering large property
accounts, the Underwriting Committee typically reviews an evaluation of property
aggregations in the particular county and state, projecting the marginal impact the specific
risk has on our aggregate modeled losses. The evaluation includes analysis of catastrophe
risk aggregation appetite and appropriate pricing for assuming the increased risk
aggregation.
We believe that we have created an effective control environment for managing natural
catastrophe risk on a gross exposure basis by (i) setting overall portfolio growth
expectations, (ii) monitoring actual results and property aggregations, (iii) having appropriate
underwriting authority controls around our largest accounts, and (iv) consistently focusing on
appropriate pricing of catastrophe risk.
Property insurance is our primary climate-related insurance operations risk. However, we
have potential climate-related claims under liability policies, such as directors’ and officers’
(""D&O"") liability insurance policies. We monitor these liability risks, but partially mitigate our
liability-related climate exposure through our (i) D&O appetite selection, which excludes
public companies and financial institutions, (ji) focus on business with small regional
footprints and without environmentally-hazardous risks, and (ii) reinsurance, should there
be a claim in excess of our $2 million casualty reinsurance retention.
Investments
Our internal investment team and external investment managers execute our investment
strategy and objectives. The MIC is responsible for (i) setting and implementing the
investment objectives and asset allocation, (ii) administering investment policies, (ii)
selecting qualified external investment managers and advisors, and (iv) monitoring
performance, transactions, and specific risk metrics, including those related to climate
change.
Operational Continuity
In addition to mitigating underwriting and investment risk, we have robust plans to ensure
operational continuity during unforeseen or catastrophic events. We have Business
Continuity Plans for our key data processing facility (Disaster Recovery Plan), the leadership
team (Executive Crisis Management Plan), and critical operational areas. We review,

7

update, and test these plans at least annually. Testing includes “tabletop” exercises and
planned hands-on tests.

Integration into Overall Risk Management: Our processes for identifying,
assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into our overall
risk management.

Because we are in the business of assuming risk, our management of climate-related risks
naturally integrates into our existing ERM framework.

We categorize our major risks into five broad categories:

1. Asset risk, which primarily stems from our investment portfolio and reinsurance
recoverables, including credit and market risk;

2. Underwriting risk, or the risk our insured losses exceed our expectations, including:
a. Losses from inadequate loss reserves;

b. Larger than expected non-catastrophe current accident year losses; and
c. Catastrophe losses that exceed our expectations or our reinsurance treaty limits.

3. Liquidity risk, or the risk we will be unable to meet our contractual obligations as they
become due because we cannot liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding without
incurring unacceptable investment losses or borrowing expenses;

4. Other risks, which include a broad range of operational risks, many challenging to
quantify, such as talent/human capital, market conditions, economic, legal,
regulatory, reputational, and strategic risks — and the risks of fraud, human failure,
modeling, inadequate business continuity plans, or failure of controls or systems,
including cybersecurity risk; and

5. Emerging risks, which can include risks in all categories that are new, rapidly
evolving, or increasing substantially compared to historical levels. For example, we
consider (i) heightened levels of economic and social inflation, (ii) the enactment of
reviver statutes for abuse victims, (iii) climate change, (iv) the increased threat of
cyber incidents, and (v) the increased use of artificial intelligence all to be emerging
risks.

Climate-related risks can impact these risk categories in a variety of ways. For example, asset
risk includes climate-related risks in our investment portfolio overseen by the MIC, and
underwriting risk includes catastrophe risk overseen by the MSC.
METRICS & TARGETS.
Metrics: Our metrics assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with
our strategy and risk management process.
Selective measures and reports on climate risks and opportunities in several different ways.
Our chief metrics and targets are the following:
1. Probability of hurricane losses and capital exposed
Our established catastrophic risk tolerance requires that we expose no more than 10%
of stockholders’ equity to a hurricane loss event at a 99.6% confidence level (1-in-250
year event or 0.4% probability) on a net of reinsurance and after-tax basis. For context,
Superstorm Sandy in 2012 was the largest tropical cyclone event in Selective’s history.
Net of reinsurance and after-tax basis, our Superstorm Sandy loss was approximately
3% of our prior year stockholders’ equity.
In addition to the 1-in-250-year modeled event, we evaluate the impact of several other
scenarios on stockholders’ equity. The table below projects hurricane losses, gross and
net of reinsurance, from the following scenarios:
+ Stochastic catastrophe modeling of our portfolio (1-in-100, 1-in-200, ete.);
+ Recasts of two large hurricanes that impacted our geographic footprint:
© 1938 New England Hurricane, one of the largest hurricanes to impact the
Northeast United States; and
19

© Hurricane Hazel, a Category 4 storm that made landfall near the border
between North Carolina and South Carolina in 1954; and
+ Realistic disaster scenarios (""RDS"") for significant potential storms in the Northeast
and the Carolinas based on Lloyds of London methodology:

We are within our established catastrophic risk tolerance as the table above reflects.
2. Capital allocation away from specifically environmentally hazardous classes of
business
Included below are targets and objectives that we have established for our Underwriting and
Investments segments:
+ We do not underwrite specific environmentally hazardous risks related to production
from coal mines, thermal coal plants, or oil sands extraction.
+ We do not invest in any new direct debt or equity of companies generating more than
30% of their revenues from thermal coal mining or electricity produced from coal.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Related Risks: Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if
appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and related risks.
We track our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions. However, as an
insurance holding company, we are a low greenhouse gas emitter relative to entities in many
other industries. Our Scope 1 emissions include consumption of natural gas, diesel,
20

refrigerant, and the fuel employees use for work travel in company cars. Our Scope 2
emissions consist of our electricity usage.
The table below summarizes our Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions across our operations and
does not include emissions from investment portfolio holdings, including limited
partnerships. For 2023, our overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions are down approximately 3%
compared to our 2019 baseline year. We chose 2019 as our baseline because the COVID-
19 pandemic significantly reduced office occupancy in 2020 and 2021, limiting our Scope 1
and 2 CO2 emissions.

“Our 2021 Scope 1 data has been restated to include an update to HFC-134A,
Since 2019, we have expanded our Commercial Lines footprint by three states, increased
‘employee count by approximately 10%, and grown net premiums written at a 10%
compound annual rate. Emissions remain below our 2019 reported baseline year despite
‘our growth.
To help calculate our GHG emissions, we engaged a third-party multinational engineering
firm specializing in energy management. Our 2019-2023 GHG inventory is consistent with
the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (GHG
Protocol).
Our only owned office location is our approximately 300,000 square foot headquarters in
Branchville, New Jersey, where we directly measure our GHG emissions. We lease 20 other
office locations (approximately 273,000 square feet), and we estimate these locations’ GHG
emissions based on square foot occupancy. We can generate approximately five milion
kWh of solar energy annually at our Branchville location, but we sell the renewable energy
credits to others, so our GHG emissions are not reduced.

Targets: The targets we use to manage climate-related risks and opportunities
and performance against targets.
We expect to continue to reduce our carbon emissions over the long term, and we have
initiatives expected to reduce GHG emissions similarly. Some include:
+ Upgrading our corporate headquarters building management system, which should reduce
heating and cooling natural gas consumption;
+ Re-designing work spaces to create more efficiencies and collaboration;
+ Reducing the use of paper with distribution partners;
+ Making efforts to transition our fleet from gasoline to hybrid vehicles; and
+ Migrating our information technology systems to the cloud.
We have also implemented additional initiatives at our corporate headquarters to lower our
environmental impact, including:
+ Enhanced waste management and recycling;
+ Recent LED conversion of all corporate headquarters light bulbs;
+ Hybrid work schedule;
+ Re-purposing commingled recyclables;
+ Installed electric vehicle charging stations for employee use;
+ Eliminating Styrofoam products in our cafeteria;
+ Recycling and more efficient energy use of electronic equipment; and
+ Reducing our water usage through automatic plumbing features.
Conclusion
We believe Selective is well positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy over
time. This TCFD report underscores our commitment to transparency and robust
management of climate-related risks and opportunities. Over the coming years, we will
continue to refine our approach, engage with stakeholders, and report on our progress.
By embedding sustainable initiatives into key aspects of our business, we have
delivered significant value over time for our shareholders by serving our internal and
external stakeholders.

"
2023,2023_SELECTIVE INS _1.pdf,"INTRODUCTION
Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (“Selective,” “we,” “us,” or “our’) is a New Jersey insurance
holding company incorporated in 1977 that owns ten property and casualty insurance
subsidiaries (""Insurance Subsidiaries""). The Insurance Subsidiaries sell products and
services only in the United States (""U.S."") and exclusively through independent insurance
agents and wholesale brokers.
We have four reportable segments, each potentially impacted by climate-related risks or
events:
Standard Commercial Lines: This segment's underwriting risk appetite is focused on
small-to-medium sized accounts, with risks weighted more towards low- to medium-hazard
than high-hazard. Standard Commercial Lines provides insurance products and services to
commercial enterprises, typically businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government
agencies. This business represented 73% of ""Total revenues’ in 2023.
Standard Personal Lines: This segment provides insurance products and services to
individuals (primarily auto and homeowners insurance) acquiring coverage in the standard
marketplace. This business represented 9% of our “Total revenues"" in 2023. Our Personal
Lines segment also includes flood insurance coverage sold through the Write Your Own
(‘WY0"") program of the National Flood Insurance Program (""NFIP""). Based on 2023 direct
premiums written, we are the fourth-largest writer of this coverage through the NFIP.
Excess and Surplus Lines (""E&S”): This segment comprises commercial property and
casualty insurance products and services provided to customers unable to obtain coverage
in the standard marketplace, generally because of unusual or higher-risk exposures. This
business represented 9% of “Total revenues’ in 2023.
Investments: This segment represents 9% (including net realized and unrealized gains and
losses) of “Total revenues” and invests the (i) premiums our Insurance Subsidiaries collect
and (i) amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which include the
issuance of debt and equity securities.

OVERVIEW OF OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING CLIMATE RISKS.
Our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard Personal Lines, and E&S segments issue
policies that cover thousands of individuals and businesses against the financial impact of
insured losses, including catastrophic events. We support economic growth by providing our

1

policyholders the contingent capital that gives them the peace of mind and confidence to
take economic risk and protect them and their communities.
Changing climate conditions increase the unpredictability of weather-related loss frequency
and severity, posing a long-term risk to our customers’ lives and livelihoods — and our
business. We aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change by (i) prudently overseeing and
managing catastrophe risk exposure, (ii) helping our customers through responsive claims
handling, risk management services, and proactive weather alerts, (iii) preparing for the
continuing transition to clean energy, and (iv) reducing our carbon footprint. Understanding
and helping mitigate climate change perils for our business and customers is core to our
operations and strategy.
Our understanding of changing climate conditions permits us to develop products and
services that increase customer resiliency and respond to evolving customer needs.
Over the medium- to long-term, we believe that the economic transition to a low-carbon
future creates new business opportunities in emerging industries, such as those associated
with renewable energy and related construction projects.
Our Investments segment incorporates sustainability considerations into our robust
investment due diligence processes. To establish appropriate sustainability investment
governance, we maintain (i) a well-diversified portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset
classes and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and
maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. In addition, we work
with our third-party investment managers to ensure they incorporate sustainability guidelines
and protocols into their investment process while managing our mandates.
We believe our climate change-related efforts (i) demonstrate our corporate responsibility to
help mitigate the impact of climate change and (ii) reward our shareholders with sustained
superior financial and operating performance over time.
We have embraced the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) for the four core elements of an organization's climate approach: (i)
Governance, (ii) Strategy, (iii) Risk Management, and (iv) Metrics & Targets. This report
outlines our initiatives and progress in each of these areas.
Governance
Board Oversight: Our board's oversight of climate-related risks and
opportunities.
Our Board of Directors oversees our Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM"") process, which
includes identifying, assessing, and managing risks related to climate change. The Board
has six standing committees that oversee and report to the full Board on certain major risks,
2

including climate risk. Our Board's Risk Committee meets at least quarterly and is
responsible for helping the Board oversee and monitor our ERM function, including climate
change-related risks and oversight of our reinsurance program.
All Board committees oversee risks specific to their supervisory areas, and report their
activities and findings to the entire Board. For example, the Finance and Investments
Committee oversees management's incorporation of Environmental, Social, and
Governance (“ESG"") considerations into their due diligence and investment decision-making
process; and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (""“CGNC"") oversees
how management addresses sustainability trends.
The Board also oversees how we set our overall strategy, including monitoring and
addressing climate risks and opportunities.
Management: Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related
risks and opportunities.
Our senior leadership team implements our strategy, including assessing and pursuing
climate change-related business opportunities. The Executive Risk Committee (""ERC""),
chaired by our Chief Risk Officer (‘CRO’), is responsible for operational oversight of climate-
related risks. The ERM unit is responsible for assessing and managing climate change-
related financial risks. We describe the roles of the ERC and ERM unit below.
Executive Risk Committee:
Our ERC, which includes our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), his direct reports, the CRO,
and other key functional leaders, provides management oversight of the ERM function. The
ERC is responsible for the holistic evaluation and supervision of our risk profile and
determines future risk management actions supporting our overall risk appetite. Several
other management committees are responsible for the detailed analysis and management of
various individual risks, some of which are climate related. At least quarterly, the ERC
reviews all major risks.
For example, the ERM unit reports our modeled results for hurricane losses (our peak
catastrophe risk peril in more severe loss scenarios), gross and net of reinsurance in our
quarterly Reinsurance Risk Scorecard provided to the ERC and Board's Risk Committee.
ERM Unit:
The ERM unit, led by the CRO, is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and
reporting key individual and aggregated enterprise-wide risks. The CRO chairs the Emerging
Risk Committee and Market Security Committee (""MSC"") and is a member of the
Management Investment Committee (“MIC’), the Large Claims Committee, and the
Underwriting Committee. The CRO attends the quarterly Reserve Committee presentation,
3

quarterly Disclosure Committee meetings, and various other senior management leadership
meetings. These management committees and functions are responsible for monitoring
various risks, including climate-related risks, described further in this report's Risk
Management section.
The ERM unit is actively involved in climate-related issues, such as catastrophe exposure
coverages and pricing. The ERM unit also manages our economic capital model and
integrates catastrophe exposure into our holistic view of enterprise risk and capital
management.
The Graph below illustrates our three levels of corporate governance of Enterprise Risk
Management:
Board oversight at the highest level, through the Executive Committee, Audit Committee,
Compensation and Human Capital Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee, Finance and Investments Committee, and Risk Committee.

Climate Risks
1. Increased model uncertainty around severe weather events resulting from
potentially higher catastrophe loss activity (short-term)
The insurance industry has used traditional catastrophe risk models for decades to
inform underwriting strategy. A significant component of climate risk is that the frequency
and severity of extreme weather events may evolve differently than historical levels —
leading to increased model uncertainty. Our third-party modeling providers are starting to
develop models incorporating forward-looking climate variables. Later in this report we
discuss how we mitigate this uncertainty.
5

2. Potential investment losses from climate risk-related impacts (medium-
term)
We maintain (i) a well-diversified investment portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset
classes and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and
maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. Our investment
portfolio is exposed to climate change risk through (i) direct physical loss to assets and
infrastructure from catastrophic loss activity and (ji) transition risk related to technology
and energy production advances that could lead to stranded assets in certain carbon-
intensive sectors.
Physical investment risks: Climate-related catastrophic losses can cause business
disruption, destroy capital, increase costs to recover from disasters, reduce revenue,
and cause population displacement and migration. These, in turn, can lead to lower
residential and commercial property values, household wealth, and corporate
profitability, which can create financial and credit market losses impacting insurer asset
values.
Transition investment risks: These arise from society's transition towards a low-carbon
economy, driven by policy and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, and
shifting sentiment and societal preferences. This transition towards renewable energy
sources may lead to stranded assets in areas such as the fossil fuel and automotive
industries. Further, it could result in higher infrastructure reinvestment and replacement
costs and increased litigation against carbon-intensive industries. Transition risks may
lead to corporate asset devaluation and lower corporate profitability, property values,
and household wealth, creating financial and credit market losses impacting insurer
asset values.

3. Insurance market transition risk (medium-term)
Increased climate-related regulations and evolving consumer preferences could change
manufacturing and construction methods. As an insurer of small- and mid-sized
businesses in the construction, mercantile, and manufacturing sectors, we could
‘experience reduced demand for specific products. While we have minimal direct
underwriting exposure to environmentally hazardous classes of business, changing
societal preferences and climate change regulations may impact our customers.

4, Regulatory risk (medium-term)
Insurance regulations could limit our flexibility in reducing exposure to certain lines of
business most vulnerable to climate change. While our Personal Lines segment

6

represented 9% of “Total revenues” in 2023, it is subject to significant state regulation,
that limits our flexibility to exit lines quickly if results meaningfully deteriorate. We also
may not receive regulatory approvals for adequate rate levels reflecting catastrophe loss
‘exposure within our products. There is also a risk of expanded climate-related state and
federal disclosure requirements.

5. Climate change impact on frequency and severity of weather events (long-
term)
The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) is an
international body responsible for assessing climate change science. In 2021, the IPCC
estimated in its “Sixth Assessment Report: Physical Science Basis” that human activities
(i) have caused approximately 1.1°C of global warming to date above pre-industrial
levels and (ii) this could rise to an increase between 1.2°C and 3.0°C above pre-
industrial levels between 2041 and 2060. Climate change models also project significant
differences in global regional warming above pre-industrial levels, depending on future
levels of climate mitigation and geographic location. These global regional differences,
whether attributable to nature or human activities, include increases in (i) mean
temperature in most land and ocean regions, (ii) hot extremes in most inhabited regions,
(ii) heavy precipitation in several regions, and (iv) the probability of drought and
precipitation deficits in some regions. These temperature changes can impact weather
patterns and the frequency and/or severity of catastrophes, including hurricanes,
wildfires, severe convective storms, and flooding — all of which could cause our
catastrophe losses to increase relative to historical levels.

6. Reinsurance risk (long-term)
The availability, quality, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions,
including traditional privately placed reinsurance, retrocessional reinsurance, and
catastrophe bond market capacity. Most of our reinsurance contracts have annual terms.
Consequently, reinsurance costs may fluctuate significantly, not necessarily correlating
to the loss experience of our specific book of business. State insurance regulators
generally permit us to consider catastrophe reinsurance expense in our filed rates and
rating plans. However, the conditions and timing of regulatory approval may not align
with the actual expense of new reinsurance terms. Disproportionate increases in our
reinsurance expense that we cannot include in our filed rates and rating plans will
reduce our earings. If we cannot negotiate desired reinsurance amounts or terms, we
may experience increased reinsurance expense and increased risk retention on
individual or aggregate claim losses that could limit our ability to write future business.

Climate Opportunities

1. Producing renewable energy (short-term)
Selective strongly believes in a clean energy future. We built ground-mount and garage-
canopy solar photovoltaic facilities at our corporate headquarters. The facilities can
generate approximately five million kWh of electricity annually, and we sell the related
solar renewable energy credits to others. As we sell these solar renewable energy
credits to others, our GHG emissions are not offset — but we are invested in cleaner
energy production.

2. Enhancing customer resiliency (short-term)
Helping our customers prepare for severe weather events mitigates loss activity.
Examples include proactive messaging and outreach before catastrophic weather events
and risk management services, including risk evaluations, internet-based risk
management educational resources, and thermographic infrared surveys that help
strengthen our customer relationships. We are also evaluating value-added services and
technologies within our Standard Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments to
enhance customer resiliency, such as our newly rolled out Risk Management Center
found on our website and our partnerships with LeakBot and Phyn for intelligent water
solutions.

3. Providing products and services to lower customers’ carbon footprint
(short-term)
We recognize that customer demand for climate-friendly products and services may
increase, and we see opportunities to provide these services to our customers. We
describe programs we have implemented in the Impact of Risks and Opportunities on
Businesses, Strategy, and Financial Planning section below.

4, Investment Opportunities (short-term)
Selective currently invests in green bonds and energy-transition-related infrastructure
instruments. In addition, we invest in tax credit transactions that help encourage the
installation of solar energy systems.

5. Developing new insurance products tailored to emerging industries
(medium-term)
As part of an economic transition to a low-carbon future, we expect new technologies,
infrastructure, and processes to be introduced — all of which will require insurance

8

coverage. We believe that, over time, this will present a sizeable business opportunity. In
the following sections, we describe how new product development is a component of our
business strategy.
6. Additional investment opportunities (long-term)
We believe the transition to a low-carbon economy will provide new investment
‘opportunities, such as green bonds or investments in energy-transition-related
infrastructure instruments. These investment opportunities could increase our
diversification of financial assets. As the clean energy sector grows and matures, we
‘expect to continue to invest in new assets that support the transition to a low-carbon
‘economy.
Impact of Risks and Opportunities on Businesses, Strategy, and Financial
Planning: The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our
businesses, strategy, and financial planning.
The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our underwriting and investment
segments follows.
Underwriting
The principal impact of climate change on our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard
Personal Lines, and E&S business is the potential for greater frequency and/or severity of
insured property catastrophic loss activity.
Catastrophe Risk Management
The ERM function models and monitors catastrophe risk, including the ongoing assessment
of catastrophe risks within our pre-determined limits. Our underwriting and risk management
frameworks employ risk mitigation tools, including:
1. Comprehensive underwriting standards;
2. Limits on coastal property exposure;
3. Risk-sharing through (a) use of appropriate wind/weather-related deductibles, and
(b) prudent reinsurance placements with high-quality third parties;
4. Modeling and managing our catastrophe risk aggregations; and
5. Active oversight from senior management and the Board of Directors.

Due to our business risk profile and geographic concentration in the Northeast and Mid-
Atlantic states, hurricane risk is our portfolio’s most significant natural catastrophe peril
‘exposure. This risk influenced our decision to diversify our underwriting portfolio
geographically and set rigorous coastal property exposure guidelines. The following
depiction of our property writings in 2002, 2012, and 2023 shows our book's geographical
diversification as we have grown the business.
The table below illustrates results of our efforts to diversify our premium geographically.

We review our hurricane risk exposure using third-party vendor models and conducting our
proprietary analysis. The third-party vendor models provide a long-term view that closely
relates modeled event frequency to historical hurricane activity. However, climate change
may cause hurricane frequency and severity to differ from historical levels. In the short- to
medium-term, we mitigate this risk by purchasing significant reinsurance protection and
setting our retained loss thresholds at levels well below the amounts we believe would
cause significant financial stress. In the medium- to longer-term, we expect to continually
evolve our risk modeling and stress thresholds based on scientific and modeling advances.
We incorporate these modeled catastrophe loss expectations within our pricing plans and
have underwriting guidelines reflecting our catastrophe exposure appetite. Modeled results
are reported to the MSC and impact our reinsurance purchasing and strategic growth
decisions.
10

In addition to managing our peak hurricane exposure risk, we seek to manage our
‘exposures to other perils, such as severe convective storms, winter storms, flooding, and
wildfires. By building a geographically diverse book of business, implementing strong
underwriting guidelines, conducting risk modeling, and purchasing reinsurance, we seek to
manage our exposure to these types of losses.

In our standard commercial lines segment, we look to our insureds to retain an appropriate
level of risk in wind/hail exposure states to severe convective storms through the use of
wind/hail deductibles and use of endorsements that put limitations on coverage for roof
surfacing including for cosmetic damage or determining roof surfacing values on an actual
cash value basis. In our Personal Lines segment, we implement mandatory wind/hail
deductibles in states exposed to severe convective storms, where allowed by law.
Opportunities

In the short term, we have several initiatives aimed at helping customers lower their carbon
footprint and increase their resiliency to catastrophic losses.

+ We send messages to our customers, helping them prepare for severe weather
events. For example, we send weather preparation notices for large storms or
hurricanes, including guides on structural improvements, roof and drainage
maintenance, and measures to prevent clogged or frozen plumbing and sprinkler
systems.

+ Our field-based Risk Management Specialists visit the business locations of certain
current and potential commercial lines customers to conduct safety evaluations. Risk
Management staff provide risk mitigation recommendations to improve worker safety
and limit potential property losses, such as from flood, wind, or fire.

+ We are a member company that supports the Insurance Institute for Business &
Home Safety (“IBHS"") and regularly leverage its research to help our customers,
distribution partners, and internal staff further their knowledge to mitigate severe
weather losses. We have in person events as well as a library of training courses
available.

+ Our GreenPAC® endorsement allows Commercial Lines policyholders (within the
coverage limits) to repair or replace covered loss property damage using building
materials, components, products, equipment, construction and design methods, and
technologies that reduce environmental impact by conserving energy, water, and
other natural resources.

+ We have enhanced our commercial Automobile ElitePac® coverage form to include
a green automobile replacement coverage. Similar to our GreenPAC® commercial

1

property endorsement, this coverage permits policyholders to replace their insured
auto after a total loss with a hybrid or electric vehicle within the coverage limits.

+ We are assessing the incorporation of value-added services within our Commercial
Lines, Personal Lines, and Flood operations that will better prepare our customers
for potentially heightened environmental and climate risks. In 2024, we launched our
new Risk Management Center in the MySelective app and on our website for
Commercial Lines customers, which features online assessments, expert support,
and on-demand training. The Risk Management Center allows us to more broadly
provide resources to insureds.

In the medium-term, we continue to actively evaluate modifications to our existing coverages
and increase our product suite to match our expected new areas of insurance coverage
demand. As a significant writer of contractors and small manufacturing risks, we believe
Selective is well-positioned to support growing market share opportunities from new low-
carbon construction processes. Providing insurance capacity to renewable energy
production facilities and related construction projects would be a longer-term growth
opportunity.
Investments
Our investment portfolio is exposed to climate change risk through (i) direct physical loss to
assets and infrastructure from catastrophic loss activity and (ii) transition risk related to
technology and energy production advances that could lead to stranded assets in certain
carbon-intensive sectors.
Physical risks: Our investment managers take a conservative approach when investing in
commercial and residential real estate products that are potentially vulnerable to climate
change-related risks. As of December 31, 2023, around 70% of our residential mortgage-
backed securities were government agency-backed. We generally invest in the top tranches
of commercial mortgage-backed securities, with ample support to protect against losses
from property value declines.
Transition risk: We also monitor our exposure to specific carbon-intensive sectors defined
by the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) as vulnerable to longer-
term climate change transition risks. As of December 31, 2023, sectors we identified in our
corporate fixed income portfolio as carbon-intensive represented less than 5% of our total
invested assets. The identified sectors and their associated percentage of invested assets
are Automotive (0.4%), Aviation (0.6%), Cement (0.0%), Coal Mining (0.0%), Oil and Gas
(1.5%), Power Generation (1.6%), Shipping (0.0%), and Steel (0.1%).

Integrating ESG into our Investment Process:
We incorporate ESG considerations into our investment process. To establish appropriate
ESG investment governance, we work with our third-party investment managers to ensure
they have ESG guidelines and protocols in their investment process while managing our
mandates.
We also are not making any new direct debt or equity investments in thermal coal
enterprises, including companies that generate 30% or more of (i) their revenue from the
‘ownership, exploration, mining, or refining of thermal coal or (ii) their electricity generation
from thermal coal.
Resilience of Strategy Considering Climate-Related Scenarios: The resilience
of our strategy taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios,
including a 2°C or lower scenario.
Evaluating perils with different return periods is crucial to identifying, assessing, and
managing climate-related risks that influence our business strategy. Modeled estimates
provide a range of potential outcomes. We review multiple models from various vendors
over several time periods to understand our catastrophic risk, including physical risks that
may materialize more frequently because of climate change. We manage our catastrophe
risk conservatively, adjusting third-party vendor models to reflect assumptions for certain un-
13

modeled costs, such as the impact of loss expenses, residual market assessments, and
automobile-related losses.
Our current catastrophe reinsurance program exhausts at approximately a 1-in-260-year
return period. As of December 31, 2023, we estimated net exposure to a 1-in-250-year
(0.4% probability of exceedance) hurricane event to equal 4% of our GAAP equity, within our
established risk tolerance and unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

“Single-event hurrcane losses are net of reinsurance, after-tax, and reinstatement premiums as of 11/26, Total

We assess the resilience of our strategy to mitigate climate-related risks quantitatively,
through natural catastrophe modeling, and qualitatively. Based on our assessment, we are
more vulnerable to physical climate risks than transitional risks. Accordingly, more severe
warming scenarios will likely increase catastrophe risk. Our primary exposure to transitional
risk is through our investment portfolio, where the percentage of fixed income assets
invested in carbon-intensive sectors was less than 5% of total assets as of December 31,
2023.
Our mix of business and underwriting approach has historically resulted in less of an impact
from catastrophe losses than the P&C insurance industry average (shown in the graph
14

below). We will continue to evaluate climate scenario analysis as a tool to complement our
catastrophe risk scenario analysis as industry guidance and models evolve.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Processes for Identifying and Assessing Climate-related Risks: Our processes
for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
Selective has a robust ERM framework that includes identifying and assessing our most,
significant risks through a combination of quantitative analysis and metrics and qualitative
assessment. Our ERM unit identifies and assesses physical, transition, and liability risks
related to climate change.
Our ERM framework includes an emerging risk management component led by a
designated Emerging Risk Committee. This committee identifies and monitors new and
evolving risk issues that may significantly impact our financial performance, reputation, or
long-term strategy. The Emerging Risk Committee has identified climate change as a “high”
level emerging risk, reviewing it at least quarterly with the ERC and our Board's Risk
Committee. The ERM unit, the ERC, and other specific employees stay informed on key
15

climate change risk developments through industry publications, webinars, conferences, and
regular engagement with outside sources, such as our reinsurance brokers, investment
managers, and trade associations.
The ERM unit evaluates our catastrophe risk exposure relative to our established
tolerances. This evaluation incorporates the results of third-party vendor models and
proprietary analysis in its review of exposure to hurricanes and other perils on both a gross
and net basis.
The table below shows the gross and net losses modeled results by peril of our underwriting
property portfolio as of July 1, 2023, The table highlights hurricane peril as our most
significant natural catastrophe exposure, driving the more significant events, or “tail,” of our
modeled catastrophe loss distribution.

+ Net losses are after-tax loses net of catastrophe reinsurance treaty, effective Jonuary 1, 2024, including reinstatement premiums.
We currently do not write crop insurance, have minimal exposure to private flood, and have
a small geographic footprint in the Western U.S., so our exposures to perils such as
droughts, wildfires, and flooding, tend to be relatively modest.
On the investment side, we monitor our exposure to carbon-intensive industries to measure
our vulnerability to climate-related risks from the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Processes for Managing Climate-related Risks: Our processes for managing
climate-related risks.
Underwriting
In managing physical climate-related risks to our insurance business, we model our property
portfolio for hurricanes and other wind events semi-annually, as of July and January.
Earthquake risk, which presents significantly lower exposure for our portfolio, is modeled
each July.
16

Annually, our Reinsurance team works closely with our reinsurance broker to produce an in-
depth analysis of the modeled results, which the MSC reviews.
We use various authority levels as underwriting controls for significant individual property
risks and large property accounts that could create or exacerbate a property aggregation
issue. If any individual location exceeds the Chief Underwriting Officer's property limit
authority, it must be approved by the Underwriting Committee (comprised of the Standard
Lines Chief Operating Officer, CFO, Standard Commercial Lines Chief Underwriting Officer,
Executive Vice President of E&S Lines, and CRO). When considering large property
accounts, the Underwriting Committee typically reviews an evaluation of property
aggregations in the particular county and state, projecting the marginal impact the specific
risk has on our aggregate modeled losses. The evaluation includes analysis of catastrophe
risk aggregation appetite and appropriate pricing for assuming the increased risk
aggregation.
We believe that we have created an effective control environment for managing natural
catastrophe risk on a gross exposure basis by (i) setting overall portfolio growth
expectations, (ii) monitoring actual results and property aggregations, (iii) having appropriate
underwriting authority controls around our largest accounts, and (iv) consistently focusing on
appropriate pricing of catastrophe risk.
Property insurance is our primary climate-related insurance operations risk. However, we
have potential climate-related claims under liability policies, such as directors’ and officers’
(""D&O"") liability insurance policies. We monitor these liability risks, but partially mitigate our
liability-related climate exposure through our (i) D&O appetite selection, which excludes
public companies and financial institutions, (ji) focus on business with small regional
footprints and without environmentally-hazardous risks, and (ii) reinsurance, should there
be a claim in excess of our $2 million casualty reinsurance retention.
Investments
Our internal investment team and external investment managers execute our investment
strategy and objectives. The MIC is responsible for (i) setting and implementing the
investment objectives and asset allocation, (ii) administering investment policies, (ii)
selecting qualified external investment managers and advisors, and (iv) monitoring
performance, transactions, and specific risk metrics, including those related to climate
change.
Operational Continuity
In addition to mitigating underwriting and investment risk, we have robust plans to ensure
operational continuity during unforeseen or catastrophic events. We have Business
Continuity Plans for our key data processing facility (Disaster Recovery Plan), the leadership
team (Executive Crisis Management Plan), and critical operational areas. We review,

7

update, and test these plans at least annually. Testing includes “tabletop” exercises and
planned hands-on tests.

Integration into Overall Risk Management: Our processes for identifying,
assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into our overall
risk management.

Because we are in the business of assuming risk, our management of climate-related risks
naturally integrates into our existing ERM framework.

We categorize our major risks into five broad categories:

1. Asset risk, which primarily stems from our investment portfolio and reinsurance
recoverables, including credit and market risk;

2. Underwriting risk, or the risk our insured losses exceed our expectations, including:
a. Losses from inadequate loss reserves;

b. Larger than expected non-catastrophe current accident year losses; and
c. Catastrophe losses that exceed our expectations or our reinsurance treaty limits.

3. Liquidity risk, or the risk we will be unable to meet our contractual obligations as they
become due because we cannot liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding without
incurring unacceptable investment losses or borrowing expenses;

4. Other risks, which include a broad range of operational risks, many challenging to
quantify, such as talent/human capital, market conditions, economic, legal,
regulatory, reputational, and strategic risks — and the risks of fraud, human failure,
modeling, inadequate business continuity plans, or failure of controls or systems,
including cybersecurity risk; and

5. Emerging risks, which can include risks in all categories that are new, rapidly
evolving, or increasing substantially compared to historical levels. For example, we
consider (i) heightened levels of economic and social inflation, (ii) the enactment of
reviver statutes for abuse victims, (iii) climate change, (iv) the increased threat of
cyber incidents, and (v) the increased use of artificial intelligence all to be emerging
risks.

risks.

ler [ sx] fo tT tT tT ft tet
Climate-related risks can impact these risk categories in a variety of ways. For example, asset
risk includes climate-related risks in our investment portfolio overseen by the MIC, and
underwriting risk includes catastrophe risk overseen by the MSC.
METRICS & TARGETS.
Metrics: Our metrics assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with
our strategy and risk management process.
Selective measures and reports on climate risks and opportunities in several different ways.
Our chief metrics and targets are the following:
1. Probability of hurricane losses and capital exposed
Our established catastrophic risk tolerance requires that we expose no more than 10%
of stockholders’ equity to a hurricane loss event at a 99.6% confidence level (1-in-250
year event or 0.4% probability) on a net of reinsurance and after-tax basis. For context,
Superstorm Sandy in 2012 was the largest tropical cyclone event in Selective’s history.
Net of reinsurance and after-tax basis, our Superstorm Sandy loss was approximately
3% of our prior year stockholders’ equity.
In addition to the 1-in-250-year modeled event, we evaluate the impact of several other
scenarios on stockholders’ equity. The table below projects hurricane losses, gross and
net of reinsurance, from the following scenarios:
+ Stochastic catastrophe modeling of our portfolio (1-in-100, 1-in-200, ete.);
+ Recasts of two large hurricanes that impacted our geographic footprint:
© 1938 New England Hurricane, one of the largest hurricanes to impact the
Northeast United States; and
19

© Hurricane Hazel, a Category 4 storm that made landfall near the border
between North Carolina and South Carolina in 1954; and
+ Realistic disaster scenarios (""RDS"") for significant potential storms in the Northeast

2. Capital allocation away from specifically environmentally hazardous classes of
business
Included below are targets and objectives that we have established for our Underwriting and
Investments segments:
+ We do not underwrite specific environmentally hazardous risks related to production
from coal mines, thermal coal plants, or oil sands extraction.
+ We do not invest in any new direct debt or equity of companies generating more than
30% of their revenues from thermal coal mining or electricity produced from coal.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Related Risks: Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if
appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and related risks.
We track our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions. However, as an
insurance holding company, we are a low greenhouse gas emitter relative to entities in many
other industries. Our Scope 1 emissions include consumption of natural gas, diesel,
20

refrigerant, and the fuel employees use for work travel in company cars. Our Scope 2
emissions consist of our electricity usage.
The table below summarizes our Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions across our operations and
does not include emissions from investment portfolio holdings, including limited
partnerships. For 2023, our overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions are down approximately 3%
compared to our 2019 baseline year. We chose 2019 as our baseline because the COVID-
19 pandemic significantly reduced office occupancy in 2020 and 2021, limiting our Scope 1
and 2 CO2 emissions.

“Our 2021 Scope 1 data has been restated to include an update to HFC-134A,
Since 2019, we have expanded our Commercial Lines footprint by three states, increased
‘employee count by approximately 10%, and grown net premiums written at a 10%
compound annual rate. Emissions remain below our 2019 reported baseline year despite
‘our growth.
To help calculate our GHG emissions, we engaged a third-party multinational engineering
firm specializing in energy management. Our 2019-2023 GHG inventory is consistent with
the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (GHG
Protocol).
Our only owned office location is our approximately 300,000 square foot headquarters in
Branchville, New Jersey, where we directly measure our GHG emissions. We lease 20 other
office locations (approximately 273,000 square feet), and we estimate these locations’ GHG
emissions based on square foot occupancy. We can generate approximately five milion
kWh of solar energy annually at our Branchville location, but we sell the renewable energy
credits to others, so our GHG emissions are not reduced.
2

Targets: The targets we use to manage climate-related risks and opportunities
and performance against targets.
We expect to continue to reduce our carbon emissions over the long term, and we have
initiatives expected to reduce GHG emissions similarly. Some include:
+ Upgrading our corporate headquarters building management system, which should reduce
heating and cooling natural gas consumption;
+ Re-designing work spaces to create more efficiencies and collaboration;
+ Reducing the use of paper with distribution partners;
+ Making efforts to transition our fleet from gasoline to hybrid vehicles; and
+ Migrating our information technology systems to the cloud.
We have also implemented additional initiatives at our corporate headquarters to lower our
environmental impact, including:
+ Enhanced waste management and recycling;
+ Recent LED conversion of all corporate headquarters light bulbs;
+ Hybrid work schedule;
+ Re-purposing commingled recyclables;
+ Installed electric vehicle charging stations for employee use;
+ Eliminating Styrofoam products in our cafeteria;
+ Recycling and more efficient energy use of electronic equipment; and
+ Reducing our water usage through automatic plumbing features.
Conclusion
We believe Selective is well positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy over
time. This TCFD report underscores our commitment to transparency and robust
management of climate-related risks and opportunities. Over the coming years, we will
continue to refine our approach, engage with stakeholders, and report on our progress.
By embedding sustainable initiatives into key aspects of our business, we have
delivered significant value over time for our shareholders by serving our internal and
external stakeholders.

2023,2023_SELECTIVE INS _2.pdf,"INTRODUCTION
Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (“Selective,” “we,” “us,” or “our’) is a New Jersey insurance
holding company incorporated in 1977 that owns ten property and casualty insurance
subsidiaries (""Insurance Subsidiaries""). The Insurance Subsidiaries sell products and
services only in the United States (""U.S."") and exclusively through independent insurance
agents and wholesale brokers.
We have four reportable segments, each potentially impacted by climate-related risks or
events:
Standard Commercial Lines: This segment's underwriting risk appetite is focused on
small-to-medium sized accounts, with risks weighted more towards low- to medium-hazard
than high-hazard. Standard Commercial Lines provides insurance products and services to
commercial enterprises, typically businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government
agencies. This business represented 73% of ""Total revenues’ in 2023.
Standard Personal Lines: This segment provides insurance products and services to
individuals (primarily auto and homeowners insurance) acquiring coverage in the standard
marketplace. This business represented 9% of our “Total revenues"" in 2023. Our Personal
Lines segment also includes flood insurance coverage sold through the Write Your Own
(‘WY0"") program of the National Flood Insurance Program (""NFIP""). Based on 2023 direct
premiums written, we are the fourth-largest writer of this coverage through the NFIP.
Excess and Surplus Lines (""E&S”): This segment comprises commercial property and
casualty insurance products and services provided to customers unable to obtain coverage
in the standard marketplace, generally because of unusual or higher-risk exposures. This
business represented 9% of “Total revenues’ in 2023.
Investments: This segment represents 9% (including net realized and unrealized gains and
losses) of “Total revenues” and invests the (i) premiums our Insurance Subsidiaries collect
and (i) amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which include the
issuance of debt and equity securities.

OVERVIEW OF OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING CLIMATE RISKS.
Our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard Personal Lines, and E&S segments issue
policies that cover thousands of individuals and businesses against the financial impact of
insured losses, including catastrophic events. We support economic growth by providing our

1

policyholders the contingent capital that gives them the peace of mind and confidence to
take economic risk and protect them and their communities.
Changing climate conditions increase the unpredictability of weather-related loss frequency
and severity, posing a long-term risk to our customers’ lives and livelihoods — and our
business. We aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change by (i) prudently overseeing and
managing catastrophe risk exposure, (ii) helping our customers through responsive claims
handling, risk management services, and proactive weather alerts, (iii) preparing for the
continuing transition to clean energy, and (iv) reducing our carbon footprint. Understanding
and helping mitigate climate change perils for our business and customers is core to our
operations and strategy.
Our understanding of changing climate conditions permits us to develop products and
services that increase customer resiliency and respond to evolving customer needs.
Over the medium- to long-term, we believe that the economic transition to a low-carbon
future creates new business opportunities in emerging industries, such as those associated
with renewable energy and related construction projects.
Our Investments segment incorporates sustainability considerations into our robust
investment due diligence processes. To establish appropriate sustainability investment
governance, we maintain (i) a well-diversified portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset
classes and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and
maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. In addition, we work
with our third-party investment managers to ensure they incorporate sustainability guidelines
and protocols into their investment process while managing our mandates.
We believe our climate change-related efforts (i) demonstrate our corporate responsibility to
help mitigate the impact of climate change and (ii) reward our shareholders with sustained
superior financial and operating performance over time.
We have embraced the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) for the four core elements of an organization's climate approach: (i)
Governance, (ii) Strategy, (iii) Risk Management, and (iv) Metrics & Targets. This report
outlines our initiatives and progress in each of these areas.
Governance
Board Oversight: Our board's oversight of climate-related risks and
opportunities.
Our Board of Directors oversees our Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM"") process, which
includes identifying, assessing, and managing risks related to climate change. The Board
has six standing committees that oversee and report to the full Board on certain major risks,
2

including climate risk. Our Board's Risk Committee meets at least quarterly and is
responsible for helping the Board oversee and monitor our ERM function, including climate
change-related risks and oversight of our reinsurance program.
All Board committees oversee risks specific to their supervisory areas, and report their
activities and findings to the entire Board. For example, the Finance and Investments
Committee oversees management's incorporation of Environmental, Social, and
Governance (“ESG"") considerations into their due diligence and investment decision-making
process; and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (""“CGNC"") oversees
how management addresses sustainability trends.
The Board also oversees how we set our overall strategy, including monitoring and
addressing climate risks and opportunities.
Management: Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related
risks and opportunities.
Our senior leadership team implements our strategy, including assessing and pursuing
climate change-related business opportunities. The Executive Risk Committee (""ERC""),
chaired by our Chief Risk Officer (‘CRO’), is responsible for operational oversight of climate-
related risks. The ERM unit is responsible for assessing and managing climate change-
related financial risks. We describe the roles of the ERC and ERM unit below.
Executive Risk Committee:
Our ERC, which includes our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), his direct reports, the CRO,
and other key functional leaders, provides management oversight of the ERM function. The
ERC is responsible for the holistic evaluation and supervision of our risk profile and
determines future risk management actions supporting our overall risk appetite. Several
other management committees are responsible for the detailed analysis and management of
various individual risks, some of which are climate related. At least quarterly, the ERC
reviews all major risks.
For example, the ERM unit reports our modeled results for hurricane losses (our peak
catastrophe risk peril in more severe loss scenarios), gross and net of reinsurance in our
quarterly Reinsurance Risk Scorecard provided to the ERC and Board's Risk Committee.
ERM Unit:
The ERM unit, led by the CRO, is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and
reporting key individual and aggregated enterprise-wide risks. The CRO chairs the Emerging
Risk Committee and Market Security Committee (""MSC"") and is a member of the
Management Investment Committee (“MIC’), the Large Claims Committee, and the
Underwriting Committee. The CRO attends the quarterly Reserve Committee presentation,
3

quarterly Disclosure Committee meetings, and various other senior management leadership
meetings. These management committees and functions are responsible for monitoring
various risks, including climate-related risks, described further in this report's Risk
Management section.
The ERM unit is actively involved in climate-related issues, such as catastrophe exposure
coverages and pricing. The ERM unit also manages our economic capital model and
integrates catastrophe exposure into our holistic view of enterprise risk and capital
management.

Climate Risks
1. Increased model uncertainty around severe weather events resulting from
potentially higher catastrophe loss activity (short-term)
The insurance industry has used traditional catastrophe risk models for decades to
inform underwriting strategy. A significant component of climate risk is that the frequency
and severity of extreme weather events may evolve differently than historical levels —
leading to increased model uncertainty. Our third-party modeling providers are starting to
develop models incorporating forward-looking climate variables. Later in this report we
discuss how we mitigate this uncertainty.
5

2. Potential investment losses from climate risk-related impacts (medium-
term)
We maintain (i) a well-diversified investment portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset
classes and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and
maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. Our investment
portfolio is exposed to climate change risk through (i) direct physical loss to assets and
infrastructure from catastrophic loss activity and (ji) transition risk related to technology
and energy production advances that could lead to stranded assets in certain carbon-
intensive sectors.
Physical investment risks: Climate-related catastrophic losses can cause business
disruption, destroy capital, increase costs to recover from disasters, reduce revenue,
and cause population displacement and migration. These, in turn, can lead to lower
residential and commercial property values, household wealth, and corporate
profitability, which can create financial and credit market losses impacting insurer asset
values.
Transition investment risks: These arise from society's transition towards a low-carbon
economy, driven by policy and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, and
shifting sentiment and societal preferences. This transition towards renewable energy
sources may lead to stranded assets in areas such as the fossil fuel and automotive
industries. Further, it could result in higher infrastructure reinvestment and replacement
costs and increased litigation against carbon-intensive industries. Transition risks may
lead to corporate asset devaluation and lower corporate profitability, property values,
and household wealth, creating financial and credit market losses impacting insurer
asset values.

3. Insurance market transition risk (medium-term)
Increased climate-related regulations and evolving consumer preferences could change
manufacturing and construction methods. As an insurer of small- and mid-sized
businesses in the construction, mercantile, and manufacturing sectors, we could
‘experience reduced demand for specific products. While we have minimal direct
underwriting exposure to environmentally hazardous classes of business, changing
societal preferences and climate change regulations may impact our customers.

4, Regulatory risk (medium-term)
Insurance regulations could limit our flexibility in reducing exposure to certain lines of
business most vulnerable to climate change. While our Personal Lines segment

6

represented 9% of “Total revenues” in 2023, it is subject to significant state regulation,
that limits our flexibility to exit lines quickly if results meaningfully deteriorate. We also
may not receive regulatory approvals for adequate rate levels reflecting catastrophe loss
‘exposure within our products. There is also a risk of expanded climate-related state and
federal disclosure requirements.

5. Climate change impact on frequency and severity of weather events (long-
term)
The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) is an
international body responsible for assessing climate change science. In 2021, the IPCC
estimated in its “Sixth Assessment Report: Physical Science Basis” that human activities
(i) have caused approximately 1.1°C of global warming to date above pre-industrial
levels and (ii) this could rise to an increase between 1.2°C and 3.0°C above pre-
industrial levels between 2041 and 2060. Climate change models also project significant
differences in global regional warming above pre-industrial levels, depending on future
levels of climate mitigation and geographic location. These global regional differences,
whether attributable to nature or human activities, include increases in (i) mean
temperature in most land and ocean regions, (ii) hot extremes in most inhabited regions,
(ii) heavy precipitation in several regions, and (iv) the probability of drought and
precipitation deficits in some regions. These temperature changes can impact weather
patterns and the frequency and/or severity of catastrophes, including hurricanes,
wildfires, severe convective storms, and flooding — all of which could cause our
catastrophe losses to increase relative to historical levels.

6. Reinsurance risk (long-term)
The availability, quality, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions,
including traditional privately placed reinsurance, retrocessional reinsurance, and
catastrophe bond market capacity. Most of our reinsurance contracts have annual terms.
Consequently, reinsurance costs may fluctuate significantly, not necessarily correlating
to the loss experience of our specific book of business. State insurance regulators
generally permit us to consider catastrophe reinsurance expense in our filed rates and
rating plans. However, the conditions and timing of regulatory approval may not align
with the actual expense of new reinsurance terms. Disproportionate increases in our
reinsurance expense that we cannot include in our filed rates and rating plans will
reduce our earings. If we cannot negotiate desired reinsurance amounts or terms, we
may experience increased reinsurance expense and increased risk retention on
individual or aggregate claim losses that could limit our ability to write future business.

Climate Opportunities

1. Producing renewable energy (short-term)
Selective strongly believes in a clean energy future. We built ground-mount and garage-
canopy solar photovoltaic facilities at our corporate headquarters. The facilities can
generate approximately five million kWh of electricity annually, and we sell the related
solar renewable energy credits to others. As we sell these solar renewable energy
credits to others, our GHG emissions are not offset — but we are invested in cleaner
energy production.

2. Enhancing customer resiliency (short-term)
Helping our customers prepare for severe weather events mitigates loss activity.
Examples include proactive messaging and outreach before catastrophic weather events
and risk management services, including risk evaluations, internet-based risk
management educational resources, and thermographic infrared surveys that help
strengthen our customer relationships. We are also evaluating value-added services and
technologies within our Standard Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments to
enhance customer resiliency, such as our newly rolled out Risk Management Center
found on our website and our partnerships with LeakBot and Phyn for intelligent water
solutions.

3. Providing products and services to lower customers’ carbon footprint
(short-term)
We recognize that customer demand for climate-friendly products and services may
increase, and we see opportunities to provide these services to our customers. We
describe programs we have implemented in the Impact of Risks and Opportunities on
Businesses, Strategy, and Financial Planning section below.

4, Investment Opportunities (short-term)
Selective currently invests in green bonds and energy-transition-related infrastructure
instruments. In addition, we invest in tax credit transactions that help encourage the
installation of solar energy systems.

5. Developing new insurance products tailored to emerging industries
(medium-term)
As part of an economic transition to a low-carbon future, we expect new technologies,
infrastructure, and processes to be introduced — all of which will require insurance

8

coverage. We believe that, over time, this will present a sizeable business opportunity. In
the following sections, we describe how new product development is a component of our
business strategy.
6. Additional investment opportunities (long-term)
We believe the transition to a low-carbon economy will provide new investment
‘opportunities, such as green bonds or investments in energy-transition-related
infrastructure instruments. These investment opportunities could increase our
diversification of financial assets. As the clean energy sector grows and matures, we
‘expect to continue to invest in new assets that support the transition to a low-carbon
‘economy.
Impact of Risks and Opportunities on Businesses, Strategy, and Financial
Planning: The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our
businesses, strategy, and financial planning.
The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our underwriting and investment
segments follows.
Underwriting
The principal impact of climate change on our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard
Personal Lines, and E&S business is the potential for greater frequency and/or severity of
insured property catastrophic loss activity.
Catastrophe Risk Management
The ERM function models and monitors catastrophe risk, including the ongoing assessment
of catastrophe risks within our pre-determined limits. Our underwriting and risk management
frameworks employ risk mitigation tools, including:
1. Comprehensive underwriting standards;
2. Limits on coastal property exposure;
3. Risk-sharing through (a) use of appropriate wind/weather-related deductibles, and
(b) prudent reinsurance placements with high-quality third parties;
4. Modeling and managing our catastrophe risk aggregations; and
5. Active oversight from senior management and the Board of Directors.

Due to our business risk profile and geographic concentration in the Northeast and Mid-
Atlantic states, hurricane risk is our portfolio’s most significant natural catastrophe peril
‘exposure. This risk influenced our decision to diversify our underwriting portfolio
geographically and set rigorous coastal property exposure guidelines. The following
depiction of our property writings in 2002, 2012, and 2023 shows our book's geographical
diversification as we have grown the business.
The table below illustrates results of our efforts to diversify our premium geographically.

We review our hurricane risk exposure using third-party vendor models and conducting our
proprietary analysis. The third-party vendor models provide a long-term view that closely
relates modeled event frequency to historical hurricane activity. However, climate change
may cause hurricane frequency and severity to differ from historical levels. In the short- to
medium-term, we mitigate this risk by purchasing significant reinsurance protection and
setting our retained loss thresholds at levels well below the amounts we believe would
cause significant financial stress. In the medium- to longer-term, we expect to continually
evolve our risk modeling and stress thresholds based on scientific and modeling advances.
We incorporate these modeled catastrophe loss expectations within our pricing plans and
have underwriting guidelines reflecting our catastrophe exposure appetite. Modeled results
are reported to the MSC and impact our reinsurance purchasing and strategic growth
decisions.
10

In addition to managing our peak hurricane exposure risk, we seek to manage our
‘exposures to other perils, such as severe convective storms, winter storms, flooding, and
wildfires. By building a geographically diverse book of business, implementing strong
underwriting guidelines, conducting risk modeling, and purchasing reinsurance, we seek to
manage our exposure to these types of losses.

In our standard commercial lines segment, we look to our insureds to retain an appropriate
level of risk in wind/hail exposure states to severe convective storms through the use of
wind/hail deductibles and use of endorsements that put limitations on coverage for roof
surfacing including for cosmetic damage or determining roof surfacing values on an actual
cash value basis. In our Personal Lines segment, we implement mandatory wind/hail
deductibles in states exposed to severe convective storms, where allowed by law.
Opportunities

In the short term, we have several initiatives aimed at helping customers lower their carbon
footprint and increase their resiliency to catastrophic losses.

+ We send messages to our customers, helping them prepare for severe weather
events. For example, we send weather preparation notices for large storms or
hurricanes, including guides on structural improvements, roof and drainage
maintenance, and measures to prevent clogged or frozen plumbing and sprinkler
systems.

+ Our field-based Risk Management Specialists visit the business locations of certain
current and potential commercial lines customers to conduct safety evaluations. Risk
Management staff provide risk mitigation recommendations to improve worker safety
and limit potential property losses, such as from flood, wind, or fire.

+ We are a member company that supports the Insurance Institute for Business &
Home Safety (“IBHS"") and regularly leverage its research to help our customers,
distribution partners, and internal staff further their knowledge to mitigate severe
weather losses. We have in person events as well as a library of training courses
available.

+ Our GreenPAC® endorsement allows Commercial Lines policyholders (within the
coverage limits) to repair or replace covered loss property damage using building
materials, components, products, equipment, construction and design methods, and
technologies that reduce environmental impact by conserving energy, water, and
other natural resources.

+ We have enhanced our commercial Automobile ElitePac® coverage form to include
a green automobile replacement coverage. Similar to our GreenPAC® commercial

1

property endorsement, this coverage permits policyholders to replace their insured
auto after a total loss with a hybrid or electric vehicle within the coverage limits.

+ We are assessing the incorporation of value-added services within our Commercial
Lines, Personal Lines, and Flood operations that will better prepare our customers
for potentially heightened environmental and climate risks. In 2024, we launched our
new Risk Management Center in the MySelective app and on our website for
Commercial Lines customers, which features online assessments, expert support,
and on-demand training. The Risk Management Center allows us to more broadly
provide resources to insureds.

In the medium-term, we continue to actively evaluate modifications to our existing coverages
and increase our product suite to match our expected new areas of insurance coverage
demand. As a significant writer of contractors and small manufacturing risks, we believe
Selective is well-positioned to support growing market share opportunities from new low-
carbon construction processes. Providing insurance capacity to renewable energy
production facilities and related construction projects would be a longer-term growth
opportunity.
Investments
Our investment portfolio is exposed to climate change risk through (i) direct physical loss to
assets and infrastructure from catastrophic loss activity and (ii) transition risk related to
technology and energy production advances that could lead to stranded assets in certain
carbon-intensive sectors.
Physical risks: Our investment managers take a conservative approach when investing in
commercial and residential real estate products that are potentially vulnerable to climate
change-related risks. As of December 31, 2023, around 70% of our residential mortgage-
backed securities were government agency-backed. We generally invest in the top tranches
of commercial mortgage-backed securities, with ample support to protect against losses
from property value declines.
Transition risk: We also monitor our exposure to specific carbon-intensive sectors defined
by the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) as vulnerable to longer-
term climate change transition risks. As of December 31, 2023, sectors we identified in our
corporate fixed income portfolio as carbon-intensive represented less than 5% of our total
invested assets. The identified sectors and their associated percentage of invested assets
are Automotive (0.4%), Aviation (0.6%), Cement (0.0%), Coal Mining (0.0%), Oil and Gas
(1.5%), Power Generation (1.6%), Shipping (0.0%), and Steel (0.1%).

Integrating ESG into our Investment Process:
We incorporate ESG considerations into our investment process. To establish appropriate
ESG investment governance, we work with our third-party investment managers to ensure
they have ESG guidelines and protocols in their investment process while managing our
mandates.
We also are not making any new direct debt or equity investments in thermal coal
enterprises, including companies that generate 30% or more of (i) their revenue from the
‘ownership, exploration, mining, or refining of thermal coal or (ii) their electricity generation
from thermal coal.
Resilience of Strategy Considering Climate-Related Scenarios: The resilience
of our strategy taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios,
including a 2°C or lower scenario.
Evaluating perils with different return periods is crucial to identifying, assessing, and
managing climate-related risks that influence our business strategy. Modeled estimates
provide a range of potential outcomes. We review multiple models from various vendors
over several time periods to understand our catastrophic risk, including physical risks that
may materialize more frequently because of climate change. We manage our catastrophe
risk conservatively, adjusting third-party vendor models to reflect assumptions for certain un-
13

modeled costs, such as the impact of loss expenses, residual market assessments, and
automobile-related losses.
Our current catastrophe reinsurance program exhausts at approximately a 1-in-260-year
return period. As of December 31, 2023, we estimated net exposure to a 1-in-250-year
(0.4% probability of exceedance) hurricane event to equal 4% of our GAAP equity, within our
established risk tolerance and unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

We assess the resilience of our strategy to mitigate climate-related risks quantitatively,
through natural catastrophe modeling, and qualitatively. Based on our assessment, we are
more vulnerable to physical climate risks than transitional risks. Accordingly, more severe
warming scenarios will likely increase catastrophe risk. Our primary exposure to transitional
risk is through our investment portfolio, where the percentage of fixed income assets
invested in carbon-intensive sectors was less than 5% of total assets as of December 31,
2023.
Our mix of business and underwriting approach has historically resulted in less of an impact
from catastrophe losses than the P&C insurance industry average (shown in the graph
14

below). We will continue to evaluate climate scenario analysis as a tool to complement our
catastrophe risk scenario analysis as industry guidance and models evolve.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Processes for Identifying and Assessing Climate-related Risks: Our processes
for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
Selective has a robust ERM framework that includes identifying and assessing our most,
significant risks through a combination of quantitative analysis and metrics and qualitative
assessment. Our ERM unit identifies and assesses physical, transition, and liability risks
related to climate change.
Our ERM framework includes an emerging risk management component led by a
designated Emerging Risk Committee. This committee identifies and monitors new and
evolving risk issues that may significantly impact our financial performance, reputation, or
long-term strategy. The Emerging Risk Committee has identified climate change as a “high”
level emerging risk, reviewing it at least quarterly with the ERC and our Board's Risk
Committee. The ERM unit, the ERC, and other specific employees stay informed on key
15

climate change risk developments through industry publications, webinars, conferences, and
regular engagement with outside sources, such as our reinsurance brokers, investment
managers, and trade associations.
The ERM unit evaluates our catastrophe risk exposure relative to our established
tolerances. This evaluation incorporates the results of third-party vendor models and
proprietary analysis in its review of exposure to hurricanes and other perils on both a gross
and net basis.
The table below shows the gross and net losses modeled results by peril of our underwriting
property portfolio as of July 1, 2023, The table highlights hurricane peril as our most
significant natural catastrophe exposure, driving the more significant events, or “tail,” of our
modeled catastrophe loss distribution.

We currently do not write crop insurance, have minimal exposure to private flood, and have
a small geographic footprint in the Western U.S., so our exposures to perils such as
droughts, wildfires, and flooding, tend to be relatively modest.
On the investment side, we monitor our exposure to carbon-intensive industries to measure
our vulnerability to climate-related risks from the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Processes for Managing Climate-related Risks: Our processes for managing
climate-related risks.
Underwriting
In managing physical climate-related risks to our insurance business, we model our property
portfolio for hurricanes and other wind events semi-annually, as of July and January.
Earthquake risk, which presents significantly lower exposure for our portfolio, is modeled
each July.
16

Annually, our Reinsurance team works closely with our reinsurance broker to produce an in-
depth analysis of the modeled results, which the MSC reviews.
We use various authority levels as underwriting controls for significant individual property
risks and large property accounts that could create or exacerbate a property aggregation
issue. If any individual location exceeds the Chief Underwriting Officer's property limit
authority, it must be approved by the Underwriting Committee (comprised of the Standard
Lines Chief Operating Officer, CFO, Standard Commercial Lines Chief Underwriting Officer,
Executive Vice President of E&S Lines, and CRO). When considering large property
accounts, the Underwriting Committee typically reviews an evaluation of property
aggregations in the particular county and state, projecting the marginal impact the specific
risk has on our aggregate modeled losses. The evaluation includes analysis of catastrophe
risk aggregation appetite and appropriate pricing for assuming the increased risk
aggregation.
We believe that we have created an effective control environment for managing natural
catastrophe risk on a gross exposure basis by (i) setting overall portfolio growth
expectations, (ii) monitoring actual results and property aggregations, (iii) having appropriate
underwriting authority controls around our largest accounts, and (iv) consistently focusing on
appropriate pricing of catastrophe risk.
Property insurance is our primary climate-related insurance operations risk. However, we
have potential climate-related claims under liability policies, such as directors’ and officers’
(""D&O"") liability insurance policies. We monitor these liability risks, but partially mitigate our
liability-related climate exposure through our (i) D&O appetite selection, which excludes
public companies and financial institutions, (ji) focus on business with small regional
footprints and without environmentally-hazardous risks, and (ii) reinsurance, should there
be a claim in excess of our $2 million casualty reinsurance retention.
Investments
Our internal investment team and external investment managers execute our investment
strategy and objectives. The MIC is responsible for (i) setting and implementing the
investment objectives and asset allocation, (ii) administering investment policies, (ii)
selecting qualified external investment managers and advisors, and (iv) monitoring
performance, transactions, and specific risk metrics, including those related to climate
change.
Operational Continuity
In addition to mitigating underwriting and investment risk, we have robust plans to ensure
operational continuity during unforeseen or catastrophic events. We have Business
Continuity Plans for our key data processing facility (Disaster Recovery Plan), the leadership
team (Executive Crisis Management Plan), and critical operational areas. We review,

7

update, and test these plans at least annually. Testing includes “tabletop” exercises and
planned hands-on tests.

Integration into Overall Risk Management: Our processes for identifying,
assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into our overall
risk management.

Because we are in the business of assuming risk, our management of climate-related risks
naturally integrates into our existing ERM framework.

We categorize our major risks into five broad categories:

1. Asset risk, which primarily stems from our investment portfolio and reinsurance
recoverables, including credit and market risk;

2. Underwriting risk, or the risk our insured losses exceed our expectations, including:
a. Losses from inadequate loss reserves;

b. Larger than expected non-catastrophe current accident year losses; and
c. Catastrophe losses that exceed our expectations or our reinsurance treaty limits.

3. Liquidity risk, or the risk we will be unable to meet our contractual obligations as they
become due because we cannot liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding without
incurring unacceptable investment losses or borrowing expenses;

4. Other risks, which include a broad range of operational risks, many challenging to
quantify, such as talent/human capital, market conditions, economic, legal,
regulatory, reputational, and strategic risks — and the risks of fraud, human failure,
modeling, inadequate business continuity plans, or failure of controls or systems,
including cybersecurity risk; and

5. Emerging risks, which can include risks in all categories that are new, rapidly
evolving, or increasing substantially compared to historical levels. For example, we
consider (i) heightened levels of economic and social inflation, (ii) the enactment of
reviver statutes for abuse victims, (iii) climate change, (iv) the increased threat of
cyber incidents, and (v) the increased use of artificial intelligence all to be emerging
risks.

risks.

Climate-related risks can impact these risk categories in a variety of ways. For example, asset
risk includes climate-related risks in our investment portfolio overseen by the MIC, and
underwriting risk includes catastrophe risk overseen by the MSC.
METRICS & TARGETS.
Metrics: Our metrics assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with
our strategy and risk management process.
Selective measures and reports on climate risks and opportunities in several different ways.
Our chief metrics and targets are the following:
1. Probability of hurricane losses and capital exposed
Our established catastrophic risk tolerance requires that we expose no more than 10%
of stockholders’ equity to a hurricane loss event at a 99.6% confidence level (1-in-250
year event or 0.4% probability) on a net of reinsurance and after-tax basis. For context,
Superstorm Sandy in 2012 was the largest tropical cyclone event in Selective’s history.
Net of reinsurance and after-tax basis, our Superstorm Sandy loss was approximately
3% of our prior year stockholders’ equity.
In addition to the 1-in-250-year modeled event, we evaluate the impact of several other
scenarios on stockholders’ equity. The table below projects hurricane losses, gross and
net of reinsurance, from the following scenarios:
+ Stochastic catastrophe modeling of our portfolio (1-in-100, 1-in-200, ete.);
+ Recasts of two large hurricanes that impacted our geographic footprint:
© 1938 New England Hurricane, one of the largest hurricanes to impact the
Northeast United States; and

business
Included below are targets and objectives that we have established for our Underwriting and
Investments segments:
+ We do not underwrite specific environmentally hazardous risks related to production
from coal mines, thermal coal plants, or oil sands extraction.
+ We do not invest in any new direct debt or equity of companies generating more than
30% of their revenues from thermal coal mining or electricity produced from coal.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Related Risks: Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if
appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and related risks.
We track our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions. However, as an
insurance holding company, we are a low greenhouse gas emitter relative to entities in many
other industries. Our Scope 1 emissions include consumption of natural gas, diesel,
20

refrigerant, and the fuel employees use for work travel in company cars. Our Scope 2
emissions consist of our electricity usage.
The table below summarizes our Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions across our operations and
does not include emissions from investment portfolio holdings, including limited
partnerships. For 2023, our overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions are down approximately 3%
compared to our 2019 baseline year. We chose 2019 as our baseline because the COVID-
19 pandemic significantly reduced office occupancy in 2020 and 2021, limiting our Scope 1
and 2 CO2 emissions.

“Our 2021 Scope 1 data has been restated to include an update to HFC-134A,
Since 2019, we have expanded our Commercial Lines footprint by three states, increased
‘employee count by approximately 10%, and grown net premiums written at a 10%
compound annual rate. Emissions remain below our 2019 reported baseline year despite
‘our growth.
To help calculate our GHG emissions, we engaged a third-party multinational engineering
firm specializing in energy management. Our 2019-2023 GHG inventory is consistent with
the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (GHG
Protocol).
Our only owned office location is our approximately 300,000 square foot headquarters in
Branchville, New Jersey, where we directly measure our GHG emissions. We lease 20 other
office locations (approximately 273,000 square feet), and we estimate these locations’ GHG
emissions based on square foot occupancy. We can generate approximately five milion
kWh of solar energy annually at our Branchville location, but we sell the renewable energy
credits to others, so our GHG emissions are not reduced.

Targets: The targets we use to manage climate-related risks and opportunities
and performance against targets.
We expect to continue to reduce our carbon emissions over the long term, and we have
initiatives expected to reduce GHG emissions similarly. Some include:
+ Upgrading our corporate headquarters building management system, which should reduce
heating and cooling natural gas consumption;
+ Re-designing work spaces to create more efficiencies and collaboration;
+ Reducing the use of paper with distribution partners;
+ Making efforts to transition our fleet from gasoline to hybrid vehicles; and
+ Migrating our information technology systems to the cloud.
We have also implemented additional initiatives at our corporate headquarters to lower our
environmental impact, including:
+ Enhanced waste management and recycling;
+ Recent LED conversion of all corporate headquarters light bulbs;
+ Hybrid work schedule;
+ Re-purposing commingled recyclables;
+ Installed electric vehicle charging stations for employee use;
+ Eliminating Styrofoam products in our cafeteria;
+ Recycling and more efficient energy use of electronic equipment; and
+ Reducing our water usage through automatic plumbing features.
Conclusion
We believe Selective is well positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy over
time. This TCFD report underscores our commitment to transparency and robust
management of climate-related risks and opportunities. Over the coming years, we will
continue to refine our approach, engage with stakeholders, and report on our progress.
By embedding sustainable initiatives into key aspects of our business, we have
delivered significant value over time for our shareholders by serving our internal and
external stakeholders.

Strategy - narrative
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s businesses,
strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
As previously stated, the Company's product offerings of annuities, and its overall business strategy, are not directly impacted
by climate-related risks. The review and assessment of climate-related risks is generally limited to SILAC’s investment
portfolio.
In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s businesses,
strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
'* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and
resiliency,
As the Company's product offerings at this time are limited to annuities, the Company has not engaged with its
constituencies on climate change-related risks as a traditional property insurer would, nor have they looked to the
Company for guidance in this area. As noted below, the Company has worked with its employees to allow for flexible
work arrangements to help mitigate the environmental impact that potentially would occur with regular travel to and
from the Company's offices.
'* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its operations or
organizations.
The Company's mitigation efforts have revolved around efficiency improvement initiatives, implementing remote work
for employees, and encouraging employee use of mass transit by offering subsidies for those costs.
A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium,
and long term.
Due to the small and indirect risk of climate change to the Company, it has not performed computer modeling or
stress testing to determine the impact of climate change scenarios over the short, medium, and long term.
In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short medium, and longer
term, insurers should consider including the following:
'* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short-term, 5-10 years as medium-term,
and 10-30 years as long-term.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business, strategy, and
financial planning.
The Company's financial planning, including its investments, are constantly reviewed and adjusted to address all
potential risk, including climate-related risks. For example, SILAC has, in the past, divested from certain energy
companies that posed unacceptable risk to the stability of the specific investments.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business, strategy, and financial
planning, insurers should consider including the following:
'* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low carbon
economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
The nature of the Company's annuity offerings and services are not designed to support the transition to a low carbon
‘economy, nor are they designed to help policyholders adapt to climate related risk.
'* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon economy.
While climate-related risks and a low carbon economy are not a primary driver of the of the Company's investment
portfolio, the Company does consider all risks and opportunities when making or divesting such investments.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
The Company's general business strategy is not directly impacted by climate-related risks, and climate-related
scenarios are not utilized. SILAC’s strategy is to remain focused on its annuity business and related opportunities and
does not intend to expand into other lines of business, such as property or liability insurance, where climate change
would propose a greater direct risk to the Company.

transition climate related risks, if applicable.
Due to its current annuity offerings, the SILAC does not currently engage policyholders in this manner.
'* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment portfolio,
including what investment classes have been considered.
SILAC measures the investment portfolio's climate risk by measuring each security's ESG score. Currently, SILACis grading
investments utilizing Bloomberg's proprietary ESG score. Specific to climate risk, the Bloomberg score measures the
issuer's energy, water, and emissions management as well as its product's sustainability. SILAC measures each individual
investment's score and then aggregates to the portfolio level.

the execution of its overall business operations and strategic initiatives. Due to SILAC’s annuity offerings, climate-
related risks are primarily reviewed and assessed for potential investment and other financial impact.
In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the
insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the following:

© Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-risk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.

Climate-related risks, to the extent that there are any, are addressed though the Company's general enterprise risk
management process and directed by the ERM Committee. The ERM Committee meets regularly to assess and review all
risks to the Company.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including which risk
factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are considered.

Due to its annuity offerings, SILAC does not utilize climate scenarios when analyzing underwriting risks.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including which risk
factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are considered.

SILAC does not currently employ climate-specific scenarios on its investments but does assess market-stress scenarios
that could potentially result from climate crises. Market-stress scenarios include shocks in interest rates, credit spreads,
equity valuation and overall volatility.

Response:
Safepoint Insurance Company is an admitted property & casualty insurer domiciled in the state of
Florida that provides individual homeowners and commercial property insurance primarily in Florida
and Louisiana, with some business in Texas, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Alabama. Climate risks are
inherent to Safepoint’s business model of insuring properties in coastal areas.
‘A. Some of the climate-related risks that have been identified are:
1. Short & medium term: Cost of reinsurance costs and return on investments
2. Long term: Loss payouts & settlements
B. Impact of climate-related risks include:
1. Higher cost of reinsurance - this is offset by improving rates to policyholders

2. Lower return on investments in the current market — maximized by adhering to
conservative investment policy and taking advantage of certain state premium tax credits
‘on investments in local/state securities.

3. Higher loss payments on large hurricane & other extreme weather events — increased the
participation percentage in reinsurance program and participation in the Florida Hurricane
Catastrophe Fund. Safepoint also keeps surplus at higher than required levels.

C._ Resilience of the insurer’s strategy

Safepoint began operations in 2013 by initially writing Florida homeowners, however

Safepoint has expanded into other states, with most of the expansion occurring in the state of

Louisiana. This market has been successful mainly due to the favorable regulatory

environment, lower severity & frequency of litigation, lower attritional losses, and lower loss

development. Safepoint’s reinsurance program is solid with participating reinsurers rated A or
higher.

‘* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low
carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.

'* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

SNCC

SNC does not specifically have a plan for the potential impacts of climate-related risks and

opportunities that have been identified on our business, strategy, and financial planning as it is not

material over the short, medium, or long-term. In addition, no specific strategy is in place taking into

consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

SNCC’s major constituencies are public entities already engaged on the topic of climate-related risks.

SNCC does not specifically have a plan for the assessment, reduction or mitigation of emissions.
However, SNCC’s two buildings (located in St. Louis, Missouri and completed in 2008 & 2021), which
house 75% of employees, were built with the latest environmental features such as heat-reflecting
roofing materials, solar panels to support power requirements for the buildings, a unique, looped air
system allowing for a reduction in total overall HVAC units for the heating and cooling of its facility and
energy efficient lighting controls that disable lighting when spaces are not occupied (motion sensitive).
SNCC’s newer facility has added energy efficient structural glass components to minimize heating and
cooling requirements for workspace, creating an even more energy efficient workspace. Both buildings
are outfitted with procedures and facilities to meet clean water standards and SNCC only utilizes green
practices and chemicals for maintenance and cleaning. Finally, the pond on the property includes an
aquatic bench and plants that provide natural filtering in addition to aesthetic beauty. SNCC does not
own facilities outside of St. Louis, Missouri and operates under lease agreements with local property
‘owners for its non-Missouri facilities.
SNC does not specifically provide products or services to support the transition to a low carbon
economy. SNCC is part of the Delphi Financial Group (DFG), and is a member of the Group. All

ITMHD
In responding to climate change, which poses a global social issue critical to human history and
important for Tokio Marine Group, our Group promote initiatives toward achieving carbon neutrality by
2050 in keeping with the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of leaving no one
behind and based on constructive dialogue (engagement) with all of our stakeholders. As an insurance
business operator (insurance products and services), institutional investor and asset manager, Tokio
Marine Group provide support both in terms of mitigating and adapting to climate change and help
customers and investment and financing recipients solve their respective issues. Efforts include
providing insurance products and services to support the transition to a decarbonized society, such as
those promoting the more widespread use of renewable energy; providing insurance to cover damages
caused by natural disasters; services that will lead to prevention or reduction of damages; and
undertaking sustainable investment and financing.
‘Asa global company, Tokio Marine Group also take climate action through collaboration and
cooperation with international and other organizations. Tokio Marine Group intend to contribute to the
mitigation and adaptation to climate change and seek growth together with our stakeholders. Social
contribution activities are also key to climate action. As such activities, Tokio Marine Group plant
mangroves and engage in research and educational activities to increase society's resilience, thereby
contributing to climate action as a good corporate citizen in local communities.
Recognition of Risks and Opportunities
In a strategy, recognizing inherent risks is essential. Tokio Marine Group assumes a rise in climate-
related risks and accordingly identifies and evaluates their impact on our business. Climate-related risks

include physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks arise from an increase in the frequency and
intensity of natural disasters caused by climate change, while transition risks result from the impacts of
the transition to a decarbonized society on the corporate value of investee companies and assets held
by us. On the other hand, initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change also provide business
opportunities for Tokio Marine Group. In the table below, we show examples of events for each risk and

Policies Concerning Insurance Underwriting as well as Investment and Financing
Tokio Marine Group's basic policy on climate change is to support the decarbonization of customers and
local communities through insurance products and services as well as investments and financing while
basing our activities on constructive dialogue with stakeholders. For investment and financing fields that
could cause significant, negative impacts on the environment or society, Tokio Marine Group
individually set up a policy on each transaction.
‘At the end of September 2020, Tokio Marine Group published our thoughts on climate change in “Tokio
Marine: Our Climate Strategy,” which we revised at the end of September 2021 and the end of
September 2022. The following sections describe our policies concerning insurance underwriting as well
as investment and financing to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Insurance Underwriting
Tokio Marine Group has not provided new insurance underwriting capacities to coal-fired power
generation projects since September 2020 or thermal coal mining projects since September 2021,
regardless of whether they are newly constructed or not. However, Tokio Marine Group may grant
exceptions for projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS"" and mixed
combustion, aiming to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, after careful consideration.
Since September 2022, Tokio Marine Group has also strengthened its commitment by protecting the
environment and supporting the transition to a decarbonized society by no longer providing new
insurance underwriting capacities to oil and gas company extraction projects” in the Arctic Circle (all
areas north of latitude 66°33, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR) and oil sands mining.

Investment and Financing
With respect to investment and financing, Tokio Marine Group will not provide new financing for coal-
fired power generation projects or thermal coal mining projects. However, as with our insurance
underwriting policy, Tokio Marine Group may grant exceptions for projects with innovative technologies
and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS and mixed combustion, aiming to achieve the goals of the Paris
‘Agreement, after careful consideration.
In aligning with our insurance underwriting policy, Tokio Marine Group also no longer provide new
financing for oll and gas extraction projects in the Arctic Circle (all areas north of latitude 66°33,
including the ANWR) and oil sands mining and are stepping up our efforts to support the protection of
the natural environment and transition to a decarbonized society.
Underwriting Management Process
Tokio Marine Group has established a strict underwriting management process for specific sectors that
we deem to pose a high risk to the environment and society. For projects that relate to any of the
specific sectors but may be subject to special consideration’?, we determine whether to underwrite
insurance by using an escalation process, through which a dedicated team will perform risk assessments.
We seek the approval of the Sustainability Committee if necessary.

In fiscal 2023, we received inquiries for four projects in the specific sectors. Of these, three were
deemed eligible and underwent an assessment by the dedicated team.
“Projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS and mixed combustion which contribute to
“achieving the goals st in the Paris Agreement, and projects conducted by companies with decarbonization plans aligned with
the Paris Agreement will be carefully decided after analyzing their ESG risks.

major industry software developers. In addition, SNCC’s risk services/loss control department works
with insureds to reduce and mitigate potential losses, including those from climate-related risks. Given
the nature of SNCC’s main products, climate-related risks are not anticipated to have any substantial
impact at this time including any assessment of financial implications.
SNCC is part of the Delphi Financial Group (DFG), and is a member of the Group. All investment activities
are handled by DFG to support the transition to a low carbon economy.
SNCC's enterprise risk management process related to climate-related risks complies with the TMHD
standard procedures described below.
TMHD
Managing Climate-Related Risk Based on Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
‘MHD conducts enterprise risk management (ERM), which includes the management of climate risks.
Through the ERM cycle, TMHD comprehensively identify and assess climate-related risks, using both
qualitative and quantitative approaches.
In the insurance underwriting business, which pursues profit through risk-taking, risk assessment is the
foundation of Group's business. TMHD has been working for many years to increase the level of
sophistication of its risk assessment for material risks (including those due to natural disasters) both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Specific initiatives are as follows.
(1) Qualitative Risk Management
‘TMHD identify all forms of risks comprehensively, including those for natural disasters such as large
wind/flood and emerging risks due to environmental changes. Of these risks, TMHD define risks that will
have an extremely large impact on Group's financial soundness and business continuity as “material
risks.” TMHD include the large wind/flood risks (including climate change physical risks) in the “material
risks” category, which could become more frequent and severe due to the effects of climate change. For
these material risks, TMHD also formulate control measures prior to risk emergence and response
measures for after risks occur.
(2) Quantitative Risk Management
For material risks, through measuring risk amounts and implementing stress tests as part of TMHD's
quantitative risk management, TMHD perform a multifaceted review of the adequacy of capital relative
to the risks held for the purpose of maintaining ratings and preventing bankruptcy.
TMHD calculate risk amounts posed by natural disasters using a risk model (for Japan, a risk model
developed in-house based on engineering theory and the latest knowledge of natural disasters, and
for overseas, models provided by outside vendors for insurance companies). TMHD independently
analyze changing trends of past tropical cyclones (typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United States)
and torrential rains and incorporate this data as necessary in order to properly assess current weather
phenomena.

CLIMATE RISK SURVEY FORM.

Furthermore, within material risks, TMHD conduct stress tests based on scenarios in which extreme
economic losses are expected and scenarios where multiple material risks occur at the same time. As for
risks involving major wind and flooding disasters, for example, these scenarios assume typhoons and
flooding on a much larger scale than the major typhoons that hit the Greater Tokyo Area in 2018 and
2019 causing extensive damages. TMHD update scenarios continuously while taking into account stress
tests released by the regulatory authorities, the latest knowledge (including that of climate change) and
the most recent case studies.
Appropriately Control Risk through Risk Diversification and Reinsurance, etc.
Natural disasters are inevitable in Japan, the Group's home market. For that reason, TMHD has sought
to control risk capital by geographic, business, and product risk diversification through M&A overseas.
In addition, reinsurance, as a hedge against risk, is also an effective way to protect the Group’s capital
and stabilize profits. The Group utilizes reinsurance to prepare for natural disasters (capital events) that,
‘occur once every few centuries, and TMHD determines earnings coverage from the standpoint of
economic rationality and take necessary measures.
Acquisition of Knowledge (e.g., Industry-Academia Collaboration)
TMHD is deepening collaboration with both inside and outside experts to acquire knowledge about risks.
Tokio Marine Research Institute collaborates with The University of Tokyo, Nagoya University, and Kyoto
University, among others, to carry out impact analysis based on the possibility for increased insurance
losses associated with natural disasters that are becoming more severe in nature. Moreover, Tokio
Marine dR and a team of experts in natural disasters working in Atlanta, the United States, are leading
efforts to upgrade natural disaster risk management across the entire Group, including various
evaluations of natural disaster risk models.

electricity) and 4) amortizing carbon credits. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2022 we achieved
carbon neutrality for the tenth consecutive year (since fiscal 2013) thanks to absorption and fixation
effects of mangrove planting and the use of carbon credits outperforming the CO2 emissions generated
by the Group's overall business activities. The value of ecosystem services generated through the
Mangrove Planting Project (from April 1999 to the end of March 2022) has reached approximately 202.4

2023 NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey

Governance

Safeway Insurance Company (“Safeway” or “Company”) is a small, privately held auto insurance
company and writes in seven states. Safeway writes primarily nonstandard, minimum limits private
passenger auto insurance. Safeway writes its business through independent agents in all seven states.
Safeway does support environmental responsibility but does not have the resources nor the justification
to fund a separate climate-related risk department.

Our leadership team does, however, actively manage the climate-related risk evident in each of our
markets. Each of our seven states have varying degrees of climate-related risk. Each state is unique and
managed by a General Manager who is responsible for mitigating climate-related risk. This is
accomplished primarily via spreading the company’s risk distribution. Each state’s General Manager is
also supported by the corporate office. In the event of a catastrophic climate event, Safeway’s Disaster
Recovery and Business Continuity teams are prepared to enact any necessary steps to ensure the
relatively seamless continuity of operations. Simulations are held at least annually to ensure that
existing plans are top of mind, current, and effective.

‘As a small, privately held company, Safeway does not have nor make public statements regarding the
Company's climate-related goals and opportunities.

The Chairman of the Board/CEO has responsibility for the presentation and discussion of risk inherent to
the business operations. This risk discussion occurs at each bi-annual board meeting and includes
discussion of climate-related risk.

Strategy

With respect to climate-related risks, as it applies to private passenger auto insurance, our strategy is to
minimize the impact of any single weather or climate event on the company’s operations and financial
well-being. By assessing a state’s unique climate-related risks, we can mitigate the potential impact of
climate-related events through specific market penetration selection and risk distribution.

Safeway (“A” rated by A.M. Best) maintains a very strong balance sheet and very low written premium
to surplus ratio (0.88:1). As such, the company is also better equipped to withstand the potential impact
of climate-related losses. Historically, losses from catastrophic weather events have had an immaterial
impact on the insurance organization's financial stability. Countrywide from 2014 through 2023, losses
from catastrophic events have averaged only $2.7 million per year, which is only 2.0% of Safeway’ total
losses. More specifically, in AZ, CA, CO, IL and NM, the average annual losses from catastrophic events
are only $69k, $10k, $1.1m, $73k and $78k, respectively. In our periodic discussions with reinsurers, and
with consideration to Safeway’s strong balance sheet, expertise in mitigating climate-related risks via
diversification of geographic risk, and limited exposure as a private passenger auto insurer, there is no
financial justification for purchasing reinsurance for the organization.

Safeway does not anticipate any significant change in the short-, medium-, nor long-term as it relates to
climate-related risks and opportunities. We expect there will continue to be weather/climate events
that may impact short-term financial results, but unless there is a significant change in capitalization
and/or lines of business offered, we expect climate-related events to continue to be immaterial to the
financial stability of the Safeway organization.

‘The Company does support environmental responsibility in meaningful ways. The Company offers a
hybrid work option to its employees which provides the option to work from home 40% of the time. By
working from home, eliminating the need to drive to work, this reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The
Company has also reduced its usage of electricity, having installed smart technology, motion sensor
lighting. Safeway has also invested in more efficient thermostat/furnace technology, reducing its usage
of natural gas. Safeway has also made recycling more accessible to its employees in the office space and
will continue its efforts to purchase more environmentally friendly office supplies. The Company has
also invested significantly in technology, for both internal and external use, which significantly reduces
the company’s dependence on and usage of paper and postage. Unfortunately, Safeway does not have
the ability nor justification to measure its reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

While the Company does not have a formal “climate change policy”, the Company does follow its
Investment Policy. The preservation of capital is the primary objective, with return on investment being
the secondary objective. This investment policy is consistent with a conservative approach to investing
which supports a diversified investment portfolio. This approach limits our exposure to fossil fuel related
investments. At any given time, Safeway’s fossil fuel investments range between 2%-3% of Statutory
Surplus.

Risk Management.

Those in positions of leadership at Safeway have extensive experience both in terms of the private
passenger auto insurance market as well as the climate-related risks faced within their respective
territories. Risk management is an integral part of our day-to-day operations. Safeway's leaders are
charged with limiting the Company's exposure through calculated market penetration and
diversification of risk distribution throughout our markets. They are guided by historical loss data and
location of loss data. Catastrophe losses (including climate-related events) are measured monthly at the
state level. This allows us to identify trends and make proactive adjustments in our risk management.
The success of this focus is clearly demonstrated by Safeway's results. Countrywide from 2014 through
2023, losses from catastrophic events have averaged only $2.7 million per year, which is only 2.0% of
Safeway’s total losses. More specifically, in AZ, CA, CO, IL and NM, the average annual losses from
catastrophic events are only $69k, $10k, $1.1m, $73k and $78k, respectively. Year after year, losses
attributed to catastrophic weather/climate events have remained immaterial to Safeway’s financial
health,

While the Company does not have a formal “climate change policy”, the Company does follow its
Investment Policy. The preservation of capital is the primary objective, with return on investment being
the secondary objective. This investment policy is consistent with a conservative approach to investing
which supports a diversified investment portfolio. This approach limits our exposure to fossil fuel related
investments. At any given time, Safeway’s fossil fuel investments range between 2%-3% of Statutory
Surplus. Additionally, because of our risk management approach, the annual average losses experienced
from climate-related events have minimal effect on our investment portfolio.

‘The Company does support environmental responsibility in meaningful ways. The Company offers a
hybrid work option to its employees which provides the option to work from home 40% of the time. By
working from home, eliminating the need to drive to work, this reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The
Company has also reduced its usage of electricity, having installed smart technology, motion sensor

also invested significantly in technology, for both internal and external use, which significantly reduces
the company’s dependence on and usage of paper and postage. Unfortunately, Safeway does not have
the ability nor justification to measure its reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Metrics and Targets

Safeway, a small, privately held auto insurance company that writes primarily nonstandard, minimum
limits private passenger auto insurance in seven states, by definition, has very limited exposure to
climate-related risks. Only approximately half of the vehicles insured by Safeway have physical damage
coverage. Despite this limited exposure, Safeway still focuses on mitigating climate-related risk. Safeway
does not utilize a modeling system. Rather, Safeway relies on its own historical loss data, density maps,
publicly available information, and the expertise of its very experienced leadership team. With these
tools, Safeway can reasonably predict expected catastrophic losses each year, at the state level. Also,
with this data, Safeway can make risk distribution adjustments as necessary to limit the potential
negative impacts of climate-related losses on our organization's financial performance.

Sagicor is exposed to several risks that are inherent in our business activities. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
provides the framework under which all risk management activities across Sagicor are coordinated. The ERM sets
clear responsibilities for identifying, assessing, measuring, mitigating, monitoring, and reporting risks, and is
based on the following elements: i) governance and culture; ii) strategy and objective setting; ili) performance;
iv) review and revision; and v) information, communication, and reporting. Our ERM is designed to both challenge
and enable our organization to understand the risks we face, selectively take risks by optimizing the relationship
between risk and reward, and effectively managing these risks to ensure we achieve our overall profitability goals
and sustain our long-term financial viability.
Responsibility for ERM permeates throughout our organization, using a three lines of defense governance model.
Business and functional units are responsible for monitoring and managing risks within their respective areas.
The responsibilities of our ERM teams include but are not limited to: selecting and/or developing adequate ERM
tools and techniques; oversight over all key ERM activities; ensuring consistent ERM definitions, concepts, and
terminology; acting as a central clearing house for coordinating ERM information; monitoring individual and
enterprise risk exposures; and, providing key ERM information to the Board and/or Board Committees (both
Group and subsidiary level).
Certain countries or regions where we operate are more susceptible to extreme weather-related events, such as
hurricanes, earthquakes, and tropical storms. We have established Business Continuity plans and processes across the
organization which we follow in the event of disaster or business disruption. These processes are frequently reviewed
and enhanced. Recent hurricane in the summer of 2024 had very limited impact to our operations.
Mortality and morbidity risk is the risk that future experience could be unfavourable relative to the assumptions used
in the pricing and valuation of our products. Mortality and morbidity risk can arise in the normal course of business
through random fluctuations in realized experience, through catastrophes, as a result of a pandemic, extreme-weather
events, or in association with other risk factors such as product development and pricing risk. Adverse mortality and
morbidity experience could also occur through systemic anti-selection, which could arise due to poor plan design or
underwriting process failure among other factors. Several external factors could adversely affect our life, health,
critical illness, disability, and long-term care insurance businesses as well as our annuity businesses.
Longevity risk is the potential losses arising from adverse changes in mortality rates relative to the assumptions used
in the pricing and valuation of our products. The risk could manifest itself slowly over time as socioeconomic conditions
improve and medical advances continue, as a result of a prolonged adverse impact of climate change, or more rapidly
‘through medical developments that extend life expectancy. Longevity risk affects contracts where benefits or costs
are based upon the likelihood of survival and higher than expected improvements in insured life expectancy could
therefore increase the ultimate cost of these benefits.
We conduct stress tests on our insurance risk variables, and incorporate various economic scenarios in our enterprise
stress testing efforts.
At this time, we don’t view climate-risks material to our organization.

SAIF’s Response:
SAIF is a monoline workers’ compensation insurance company with nearly all of its
exposure concentrated in Oregon. Climate-related events are not likely to be a material
driver of workers’ compensation losses compared to other lines of business. SAIF does
not yet have any stated goals on climate-related risks or opportunities. However, we do
consider how climate-related risks may affect our customers and key operational and
strategic decisions.
SAIF evaluates climate-related risks through its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
program, which is governed by an ERM Committee. Risk owners within SAIF’s business
units are responsible for identifying, monitoring, managing, and reporting key risks. The
ERM committee evaluates and approves risk exposure assessments, risk appetite
statements, and risk management practices proposed by risk owners annually. The ERM
committee also reviews significant new and existing risks that may materially impact
the enterprise. The audit committee of SAIF’s board of directors is informed about
material risks by senior management.

SAIF's Response:
As noted above, climate-related events are not likely to be a material risk driver for
SAIF. However, we consider how climate-related risks may affect our customers and
key operational and strategic decisions.
SAIF has not taken steps with key constituencies on the broader topic of climate
change. SAIF does have a robust safety and health program for our policyholders and
their workers designed to drive awareness, promote proactive safety cultures, and
mitigate the impact of workplace risk and hazards. These include climate-related
exposures, such as heat-related illnesses, wildfire smoke illnesses, and weather-related
injuries due to wet or icy conditions.

Within our organization, we continue to implement changes to reduce the impact of our
carbon footprint. While SAIF does not have a detailed plan to assess, reduce, or
mitigate its emissions in its operations, we have strategies and programs in place to
help us reduce our overall emissions, including:

+ Flexible work: SAIF has a flexible work policy that allows many employees to
work remotely most days, significantly reducing the number of employees
driving to offices and energy consumption within our buildings.

+ Vehicle fleet management: SAIF's fleet includes a mix of hybrid, electric, and
fuel-efficient vehicles. SAIF ensures that all vehicles have regular maintenance,
keeping the fleet running at optimum efficiency. Electric vehicle charges are
available for fleet and employee vehicle use.

+ Sustainable building design and management: SAIF's Salem headquarters was
designed to meet silver LEED standards (certification not applied for) and
includes many energy-saving features, including HVAC, lighting, windows,
plumbing, roofing, insulation, and equipment. Recent renovations and retrofits of
other real estate holdings also included energy-efficient and environmentally
conscious features.

+ Recycling: SAIF recycles many items, including paper, electronics, batteries,
fluorescent lamps, printer cartridges, and cooking oil.

+ Environmentally responsible purchasing: SAIF gives preference to
environmentally superior products when making purchasing decisions and
includes contract language to support similar practices by SAIF vendors. When
appropriate, SAIF also considers life-cycle cost, including how the products are
produced, management practices of suppliers and producers, the product's use,
and end-of-life disposal.

SAIF does not have a climate change policy with respect to investment management.
SAIF's investment managers are hired and directed by the Oregon State Treasury, and
they consider climate-related risks along with other risks in evaluating investment
decisions.
SAIF has not identified climate-related risks by time horizon or assessed the impact
of specific climate-related scenarios.

SAIF‘s Response:

SAIF considers climate-related risks through our ERM process using our organizational
risk taxonomy and in other operational efforts.

For example, SAIF addresses some climate-related underwriting risks through
partnership between our safety & health and underwriting teams. Our safety and health
team works directly with our customers to provide training on safe working practices in
extreme weather conditions. We hold seminars in English and Spanish (virtually and in-

consider the impact of climate-related injuries, such as heat-related claims, slip trips
and falls in inclement weather, and injuries sustained in wildfire efforts in making
underwriting and pricing decisions. We also have processes and procedures for
managing heat-related risks for our employees.
SAIF's investment managers consider climate-related risks and other risks as they
evaluate investment decisions. SAIF’s investments include real estate holdings, which
are diversified by region to mitigate the impacts of weather-related disasters.

Governance
‘The Company's Board of Directors oversees management of our climate-related risks and opportunities based
on guidance from the Company's Climate Risk Subcommittee. This Subcommittee’s primary function is to
provide guidance and oversight of Sammons Financial Group, Inc. and its member companies’ (collectively,
“SFG"" or “Company’) response to climate risk and assist the Board of Directors in overseeing management's
setting of risk appetite and tolerances, as well as guidance on defining an approach to quantify climate risks,
particularly those related to investments and mortality.
Management's assessment and oversight of climate-related risks primarily is accomplished within the
Company's Enterprise Risk Management (""ERM"") framework. The Company's ERM framework includes eight
separate risk committees and an overarching Executive ERM Committee. Each committee includes members
from cross-functional areas of the Company. Climate-related risks are the responsibility of the Corporate ERM
Committee. The Company's Chief Risk Officer oversees the ERM function, including olimate-related risks.
Additionally, responsibility for management of our investment portfolios, including with respect to climate-related
risks, sits with the Chief Investment Officer.
Strategy
While the known impacts of climate-related risks continue to surface, potential impacts to our business strategy
and operations have been considered
Direct physical risks to the company’s operations: The Company has identified that climate risk
could increase the frequency or severity of weather-related events impacting the company's physical
locations and operations. The Company has a comprehensive Business Continuity program and a
Corporate Disaster Recovery Plan to address risks to our operations. Any business disruptions will be
managed by such programs.
Indirect physical risks to company’s insurance exposures: The Company does not anticipate short
term impacts to our life insurance and annuity products as a result of climate change. Longer term
impacts may emerge as through the increased incidence of mortality, lapses, and expenses. We will
monitor these changes as part of our overall risk management process.
Transition and indirect physical impacts to the Company's current and future investments:
Through the Company's investments and investment strategy it may potentially be impacted by physical
and transition climate risks. As the vast majority of the Company's assets are externally managed, we
plan to work with our investment managers to identify and mitigate potential risks posed by climate
change.
Legal and regulatory risks may occur as climate regulations emerge: Failure to comply with
regulations could lead to reputational risk and monetary penalties. As with all regulatory and compliance
risks, the Company will actively monitor and manage climate-related risks arising out of such
regulations.

climate risks specifically, we utilize internal and external expertise (research papers, consulting firms) to assist
in the assessment of risks and possible mitigation efforts. The Company employs a “Three Lines of Defense”
model, whereby the business units (1* line) are accountable for identifying, monitoring and escalating risks on
a daily basis. Risk identification is formalized by our ERM Committees (2 line), which includes our Climate
Risk Subcommittee. Internal audit forms the 3° line of defense and provides independent assurance of the
control and risk environment. An additional part of our risk assessment process involves interviews with key
stakeholders and internal risk identification surveys.
Included in the Risk Management Framework is a Risk Appetite Statement and risk limits are set consistent
with the Company risk appetite. Given the nature of the Company's business, risk limits have not been set at a
level specific to climate risk. When appropriate, the Company conducts modeling to assess and measure risk
‘exposures. Sensitivity testing of various insurance and economic risks are performed as part of our risk function,
during product pricing, annual Cash Flow testing, and during our Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (""ORSA’)
process. This type of testing includes a wide range of sensitivities without directly defining the underlying
drivers. While specific climate risk scenarios are not explicitly defined, the sensitivities modeled capture
potential risks outcomes that could occur from climate risk driven insurance and investment events.
Pertinent discussions related to possible risk response techniques are held in our ERM committees, concluding
with a discussion and approval of these efforts at the Executive level. Risk and risk responses are then
systematically tracked, tested, and supervised through our ERM Committees, senior management, Internal
Audit, and the Board.
Metrics and Targets
One of the Company's primary focuses for targeting climate-related risks is reducing our carbon footprint. This
is an area the Company is actively monitoring and exploring, which includes a calculation of our current carbon
outputs, and continuing to contemplate strategies to reduce our footprint. While these targets are partially driven
by regulatory requirements, we are equally motivated by stakeholder and consumer expectations of sound,
climate-friendly business practices.
As part of our business operations, the Company owns and leases real estate. We consistently consider
potential climate related impacts to our physical locations. In fact, when the Company built our new corporate
headquarters in 2020 in West Des Moines, lowa, the Company adhered to best practices for green designs
Where feasible. In 2023, this 234,000 square foot building was recognized by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency as Energy-Star certified,
The Company also owns a 120,000 square foot building in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which utilizes a
geothermal energy system.
The Company is also party to a number of leases. In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the Company leases
approximately 38,000 square feet of warehouse storage, used primarily for records retention. In Chicago,
llinois, the Company leases commercial office space consisting of approximately 10,000 square feet. For this
space, the Company adheres to sustainability and green building requirements, as required by the landlord and
llinois statutes. Finally, the Company also leases commercial office space in Fargo, North Dakota
(approximately 13,500 square feet) and Dayton, Ohio (approximately 3,000 square feet). For each leased
space, the Company regularly monitors the appropriate amount of square footage needed for its business
operations, and when appropriate, reduces its physical footprint, leading to a decrease in its carbon footprint.
In December 2023, the Company acquired NorthRock Partners, LLC, and assumed responsibility for their
leased real estate. As a result of this acquisition, the Company is now a party to an additional seven leases in
Alexandria, Minnesota (2,068 sq. ft.); Appleton, Wisconsin (5,217 sq. ft.); Deer Park, Illinois (7,117 sq. ft);
Milwaukee, Wisconsin (3,734 sq. ft.); Minneapolis, Minnesota (55,185 sq. ft.); San Francisco, California (5,550
sq. ft); and San Rafael, California (1,184 sq. ft).

For each leased space, the Company regularly monitors the appropriate amount of square footage needed for
its business operations, and when appropriate, reduces its physical footprint, leading to a decrease in its carbon
footprint.
The Company owns and operates two vehicles: a 2017 Ram Promaster van, and a 2012 Kubota tractor; both
vehicles are used in our Sioux Falls locations.
Finally, the Company calculated its calendar year 2023 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG using methodology
consistent with the WRIWBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard for emission
calculations. Scope 3 emissions have not been evaluated or calculated at this time. The results of this
calculation have been normalized into carbon dioxide equivalents and are as follows: Scope 1: 469 MTCO2e,
Scope 2 (location-based): 2,611 MTCO2e, and Scope 2 (market-based): 2,919 MTCO2e. The Company has
defined its organizational boundary on an operational control basis, which includes emissions from energy
usage at leased and owned facilities and use of corporate vehicles. Though robust data collection was
attempted for all relevant activity data, this information was not always readily available. In these instances,
estimations were leveraged based on available facility information and metrics provided by the US Energy
Information Administration. Where practical, the Company is continually working to improve its data collection
for more precise reporting in the future.

climate risks specifically, we utilize internal and external expertise (research papers, consulting firms) to assist
in the assessment of risks and possible mitigation efforts. The Company employs a “Three Lines of Defense”
model, whereby the business units (1* line) are accountable for identifying, monitoring and escalating risks on
a daily basis. Risk identification is formalized by our ERM Committees (2 line), which includes our Climate
Risk Subcommittee. Internal audit forms the 3° line of defense and provides independent assurance of the
control and risk environment. An additional part of our risk assessment process involves interviews with key
stakeholders and internal risk identification surveys.
Included in the Risk Management Framework is a Risk Appetite Statement and risk limits are set consistent
with the Company risk appetite. Given the nature of the Company's business, risk limits have not been set at a
level specific to climate risk. When appropriate, the Company conducts modeling to assess and measure risk
‘exposures. Sensitivity testing of various insurance and economic risks are performed as part of our risk function,
during product pricing, annual Cash Flow testing, and during our Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (""ORSA’)
process. This type of testing includes a wide range of sensitivities without directly defining the underlying
drivers. While specific climate risk scenarios are not explicitly defined, the sensitivities modeled capture
potential risks outcomes that could occur from climate risk driven insurance and investment events.
Pertinent discussions related to possible risk response techniques are held in our ERM committees, concluding
with a discussion and approval of these efforts at the Executive level. Risk and risk responses are then
systematically tracked, tested, and supervised through our ERM Committees, senior management, Internal
Audit, and the Board.
Metrics and Targets
One of the Company's primary focuses for targeting climate-related risks is reducing our carbon footprint. This
is an area the Company is actively monitoring and exploring, which includes a calculation of our current carbon
outputs, and continuing to contemplate strategies to reduce our footprint. While these targets are partially driven
by regulatory requirements, we are equally motivated by stakeholder and consumer expectations of sound,
climate-friendly business practices.
As part of our business operations, the Company owns and leases real estate. We consistently consider
potential climate related impacts to our physical locations. In fact, when the Company built our new corporate
headquarters in 2020 in West Des Moines, lowa, the Company adhered to best practices for green designs
Where feasible. In 2023, this 234,000 square foot building was recognized by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency as Energy-Star certified,
The Company also owns a 120,000 square foot building in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which utilizes a
geothermal energy system.
The Company is also party to a number of leases. In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the Company leases
approximately 38,000 square feet of warehouse storage, used primarily for records retention. In Chicago,
llinois, the Company leases commercial office space consisting of approximately 10,000 square feet. For this
space, the Company adheres to sustainability and green building requirements, as required by the landlord and
llinois statutes. Finally, the Company also leases commercial office space in Fargo, North Dakota
(approximately 13,500 square feet) and Dayton, Ohio (approximately 3,000 square feet). For each leased
space, the Company regularly monitors the appropriate amount of square footage needed for its business
operations, and when appropriate, reduces its physical footprint, leading to a decrease in its carbon footprint.
In December 2023, the Company acquired NorthRock Partners, LLC, and assumed responsibility for their
leased real estate. As a result of this acquisition, the Company is now a party to an additional seven leases in
Alexandria, Minnesota (2,068 sq. ft.); Appleton, Wisconsin (5,217 sq. ft.); Deer Park, Illinois (7,117 sq. ft);
Milwaukee, Wisconsin (3,734 sq. ft.); Minneapolis, Minnesota (55,185 sq. ft.); San Francisco, California (5,550
sq. ft); and San Rafael, California (1,184 sq. ft).

For each leased space, the Company regularly monitors the appropriate amount of square footage needed for
its business operations, and when appropriate, reduces its physical footprint, leading to a decrease in its carbon
footprint.
The Company owns and operates two vehicles: a 2017 Ram Promaster van, and a 2012 Kubota tractor; both
vehicles are used in our Sioux Falls locations.
Finally, the Company calculated its calendar year 2023 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG using methodology
consistent with the WRIWBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard for emission
calculations. Scope 3 emissions have not been evaluated or calculated at this time. The results of this
calculation have been normalized into carbon dioxide equivalents and are as follows: Scope 1: 469 MTCO2e,
Scope 2 (location-based): 2,611 MTCO2e, and Scope 2 (market-based): 2,919 MTCO2e. The Company has
defined its organizational boundary on an operational control basis, which includes emissions from energy
usage at leased and owned facilities and use of corporate vehicles. Though robust data collection was
attempted for all relevant activity data, this information was not always readily available. In these instances,
estimations were leveraged based on available facility information and metrics provided by the US Energy
Information Administration. Where practical, the Company is continually working to improve its data collection
for more precise reporting in the future.

Seaview Insurance Company
GOVERNANCE
1. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
In disclosing the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities insurers should consider
including the following:
* Identify and include any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and opportunities.
* Describe where climate-related disclosure is handled within the insurer’s structure, e.g., at a group level,
entity level, or a combination. If handled at the group level, describe what activities are undertaken at the
company level.
A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and
opportunities.
In describing the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the climate-
related financial risks, insurers should consider including the following:
* Describe the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the
climate-related financial risks.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
| Seaview Insurance Company (Company) does not have a formal governance nor formal stated
goals on climate-related risks and opportunities. Risk is managed by line of business (LOB) in
terms of aggregate exposures, availability/utilization of appropriate reinsurance structures, and
measured within zip codes and broader state-by-state geography. Any oversight of climate-
related risks and opportunities would be the responsibility of upper management and the Board
of Directors.
STRATEGY
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s businesses,
strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and
resiliency. *
* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its operations
or organizations. *
A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium,
and long term.
In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium, and
longer term, insurers should consider including the following:

* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short term, 5-10 years as
medium term, and 10-30 years as long term.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and
financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and financial
planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low-
carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low-carbon
economy.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2-degree Celsius or lower scenario.
| The majority of the Company’s underwriting risk is written on an annual basis and is thus subject
to frequent re-underwriting and re-pricing ~a process through which we are diligent to analyze
trends around pricing, reinsurance availability, inflation and competitor offerings.
We are diversified across multiple lines of property, wheels and surety business to limit the total
impact of any one type of risk. Property insurance products are sold in geographically diverse
areas to spread the risk. Moreover, Seaview is broadly reducing its property catastrophe exposure.
We periodically review our policies to make sure the coverage is not too concentrated in any area.
We utilize industry simulation models to measure our exposure to catastrophes and these models
account for changes in the expected frequency of hurricanes due to expected climate conditions,
The Company will elect to utilize reinsurance where appropriate and economically feasible,
primarily to limit the impact of catastrophes. New business is closely managed with temporary
restrictions during known or forecast catastrophic events.
The Company has not taken steps to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate change.
The Company does not have the expertise to influence our constituencies on this subject. Our
insurance products do not directly influence consumers to reduce their own carbon footprint,
although indirectly, the application of Fireline scores or similar risk analysis tools on
homeowners' policies leads to better pricing with lower scores, and lower scores are typically
indicative of fire risk mitigation such as brush clearing or defensible space. This has the potential
to change consumer behavior slowly, indirectly and sporadically over time but ultimately leads to
some un-quantifiable benefit in lowering overall wildfire risks. Whether this has any meaningful
impact on transitioning consumers to a ‘low carbon economy’ is questionable.
The Company leases substantially all of its office space. It does not have control over the
mechanical aspect of the facilities that would affect energy consumption or emissions. Some
‘measures that have been taken are electronic document filing, lighting with automated shut-off,
recycling bins in all offices, the purchase of energy-saving appliances in kitchen areas, increased
opportunities for employees to work from home, and an emphasis on teleconferences over travel.
RISK MANAGEMENT
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers
should consider including the following:
* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting portfolio, and
how the company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to physical, transition and liability

risk. *
* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential physical
and transition climate related risks, if applicable. *
* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment portfolio,
including what investment classes have been considered. *
A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers should consider
including the following:
* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how frequently
the process is completed. *
B. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into
the insurer's overall risk management.
In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the
insurer’s overall risk management, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-risk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.
The Company does not have a formal process for identifying climate change-change related
risks, Our risk portfolio is broadly migrating away from property cat risks, as noted above.
As has ever been the case in the insurance industry, managing risk concentration through
aggregate management is the key determinant to successfully managing property
underwriting exposures. We remain keenly focused on this component of exposure
management. As such, the Company’s biggest exposures remain regional weather-related
events. We track these risks by monitoring risk concentration, limiting our coastal exposures,
and purchasing reinsurance. We utilize industry simulation models to measure our exposure
to catastrophes, and these models account for changes in the expected frequency of
hurricanes due to expected climate conditions.
The Company will elect to utilize reinsurance on occasion, when, where and as economically
feasible. Evaluation of Excess of Loss options to provide coverage to limit the impact of
catastrophes is periodically reviewed. We also regularly review our policies to make sure the
coverage is not too concentrated in any area. We utilize industry simulation models to
‘measure our exposure to catastrophes, and these models account for changes in the expected
frequency of hurricanes due to expected climate conditions.
The Company has not taken any steps to encourage policyholders to reduce losses caused by
climate change-influenced events. The Company does not have the expertise to influence our
policyholders on this subject.
The Company has not considered the impact of climate change on its investment portfolio
and has not altered its investment strategy in response to these considerations. Seaview’s
investments are managed by an independent investment advisory firm that follows the
investment policy that was approved by the Board of Directors Investment Committee. The
Company’s investment managers have not identified any significant concentrations of
climate change risk on securities in our current portfolio. ASIC does not heavily invest in

heavy carbon-emitting industries. The Company does not believe there is a significant
component of fixed income or equity securities that will be adversely impacted by climate
change-related catastrophes.
METRICS AND TARGETS
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your business.
Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to assess, if any.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:
+ In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate
scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount
of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related
risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
The Company does not participate in, cede risk to or rely upon for reinsurance support any
werond” collateralized reinsurance vehicles, whether for catastrophe risks or any other lines of
business which may occasionally be ceded to a collateralized structure.

2023,2023_Security Benefit Life Ins Co.pdf,"‘ABOUT THIS INDEX
The information and disclosures in this document are subject to change as we continue to refine our Corporate Responsibility (CR) program, focused on
governance, social and environmental issues important to the Company. As a life insurance company focused on annuity and other retirement products,
Security Benefit’s focus on climate-related risk is significantly different than, for example, property and casualty insurers. Security Benefit is committed to
CR progress for our employees, customers, investors, communities, and other stakeholders, and continues to evolve its program to meet new challenges
and opportunities. Security Benefit is sometimes referred to herein as the “Company.”
Disclose the a) Describe the board's | Security Benefit is committed to strengthening our resilience against risk through progress on

and opportunities Security Benefit Life Holding Company (""SBLH”), and First Security Benefit Life Insurance and Annuity
Company of New York (""FSBL”), oversee management of our CR program, including climate-related
risks and opportunities. They do so through their Corporate Responsibility (CR) Committees and Audit
Committees.
The CR Committees include cross-functional representation and meet periodically (usually jointly) to
receive reports from and furnish direction to the Corporate Responsibility Working Group (""CR
WG"" for the collective Security Benefit organization. The CR Committees in turn report to and
receive direction from their respective boards of directors. The CR Committees include the
companies’ Chief Financial Officer (""CFO""), General Counsel (“GC”), Chief Human Resources Officer
(“CHRO”), and FSBL’s Audit Committee Chair; the CFO and GC are also directors of each of SBLIC and
FSBL.
‘+ The Audit Committees, which also report to the companies’ respective boards of directors, receive
reports from Security Benefit’s Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Committee, which is a
management level committee overseen by Security Benefit Corporation's Audit Committee.

b) Describe Management leads our ERM Committee. The ERM Committee is chaired by the organization’s

management's role in Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), who is responsible for the execution of systematic, disciplined, and

assessing and managing proactive risk management processes in line with our ERM policy, and ensures any potential

climate-related risks and strategies are evaluated for effectiveness. The CRO provides regular updates on risk management

opportunities to the respective SBLIC and FSBL Boards of Directors’ Audit Committees. The ERM Committee
meets at least quarterly to review and discuss: closely monitored risks (risks currently out of
tolerance) and the status of mitigation plans to address changes to risk levels; updates to the risk
register; annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) scenarios and results; annual risk
assessments and internal audit plans; and all other risk management initiatives.

+ Other members of the ERM Committee include members of the organization’s senior
management, including the organization's GC, to whom reputation risk is assigned. Because CR risk
isa sub-risk of reputation risk, the co-chairs of the CR WG meet periodically with the GC to discuss
CR risk and mitigation. The GC in turn meets with the CRO, generally monthly, to discuss the risks
assigned to him and periodically reports on such risks to the full ERM Committee.

‘The ERM framework and its components are periodically reviewed as part of the Company's
independent Internal Audit function.

‘The CR Working Group (WG) is a cross-disciplinary group co-chaired by an Assistant Vice President,

Governmental Affairs, and a Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, both of whom report to

Security Benefit’s GC. Other members of the CR WG include representatives from Finance,

Investments, Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Facilities, and ERM. The CR WG meets

periodically, generally at least quarterly, or more often as needed.

The CR WG is the organization's front line in the overall assessment of climate-related risks and
opportunities. For example, it performed Security Benefit’s initial identification of CR risks and
opportunities and in 2023, led and completed both a comprehensive materiality/key issues study
and TCFD alignment assessment with guidance from a qualified consultant retained by the CR WG.

The CR WG makes recommendations to our senior management and CR Committees for continued
development of the Company's CR program, including goals, policies, communication tools, actions
and a timeline to address gaps between current practices and such goals and policies.

The CR WG is continuing to evolve its approach to CR across multiple aspects of the business and is
developing appropriate policies, in line with both internal recommendations and external
considerations.

‘The CR WG isin the process of finalizing an overall CR Policy for the Company, describing how the

Company monitors and manages climate risks in line with its risk appetite and as outlined in the

Company's extensive ERM framework. The Company and the CR Committees, as part of their

continuing work on these topics, will review and consider adoption of such a policy at their next joint

meeting.

COVID-19 pandemic), a continuously evolving severe weather plan, and environmental facilities
enhancements to keep associates safe and protected, while business operations continue
uninterrupted. We regularly update our organizational resilience plans to better integrate evolving
risks, including climate-related risks, along with other possible factors.

""Security Benefit has taken measures to manage operational energy and resource consumption,
reduce emissions from our buildings and vehicles, and implement environmentally friendly
practices, such as: installing LED fixtures and using an air filtration system utilizing fresh air for

paper and paper food service products, and using electric vehicles on our Topeka campus.

""Our utility provider is moving towards a 70% carbon emission reduction (against 2005 levels) by
2030, with a goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2045, enabled by a combination of
supportive energy policies and evolving technology, and with renewable resources, such as wind,
estimated to be approximately 33% of total generation capacity. As of 2021, our utility provider
had achieved a 46% reduction of carbon emissions against 2005 levels.

security. Our charter embodied a new concept of fraternalism, which enabled the

average person to buy life insurance — previously available only to the wealthy — and

reflected through associate development and engagement opportunities.

collage and career fairs, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Tribal Collages and Universities

(TCU), The Company also supports the Latino community trough services offered by Topeka LULAC Senior Center and

RESPONSE TO STRATEGY:
The Company has identified potential climate change risks related to investments, liquidity, and
disaster recovery. Regarding investment and liquidity risks associated with climate change, the
Company works with its external investment advisors to manage these risks. The primary external
advisor has integrated an ESG risk review into their work on the Company's Fixed Income portfolio
and their research process for investments. In addition, the Company's internal commercial
mortgage program includes procedures that factor in potential climate-change exposures such as
flood zone and natural disaster concentrations. The Company includes carbon scores as an
optimization metric when evaluating investment opportunities.
Additionally, the Company has identified disaster recovery risks associated with climate change,
primarily flood related, which have historically affected the surrounding area of the Company's
Main Office. The Company's ERM framework and Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”) address various
climate change risks and are designed to assist business continuity in the event of a physical
climate-related hazard. The Company's BCP provides for remote business functionality, flexible
contingency plans, and continued communication among management and key employees in times
of physical hazards. The Business Continuity Plan is designed to enable the Company to continue to
operate even if the Company's physical premises suffers catastrophic damage.
The Company continues to focus its environmental sustainability efforts on initiatives it can take to
minimize the impacts that its operations have on the environment. As a life insurer, the Company
does not offer products relevant to the transition to a low carbon economy. However, the
Company is adapting its business practices for low carbon electronic technologies, such as
electronic delivery of policy documents. The Company continues to reduce the consumption of
resources such as electricity, water, and paper through a variety of ongoing initiatives. As a normal

in governance, if any, and assisting with development of mitigation strategies. The Chair of the ERM
Committee presents a consolidated risk report to the Audit and Risk Committee on a regular basis,
together with the ERM Committee's recommendations with respect to identified material risks and
applicable mitigation strategies. The Audit and Risk Committee and the Board review the ERM
Committee's recommendations and maintain ultimate oversight responsibility regarding climate-
related risk management policies.
The Board’s Finance Committee oversees the climate-related risks and mitigation strategies
associated with the Company's investment portfolio through its oversight of the Company's
investment activities (including those of its investment advisors). As stated in the Response to
Strategy section, the Company works with its investment advisor to manage climate-related risks to
its investment portfolio. The Company reports ESG and carbon scores regularly to the Board’s
Finance Committee.
The Company continues to monitor climate-related risks to its underwriting portfolio from a life
insurance underwriting standpoint. The Company has not identified climate scenarios that would
materially impact its underwriting results (mortality events, causation of significant non-premium
paying events, etc.). The Company will continue to monitor and refine as needed.

TCFD-ALIGNED QUESTIONS
UPDATED 2022

GOVERNANCE

Security National Life Insurance Company (“SNL”) is a market leader in “end-of-life”
insurance products and services. SNL's offerings, which include annuity, final expense, and
preneed products, currently do not have any material climate-related impacts. Although SNL
has no publicly stated climate goals, the company monitors relevant literature and studies
concerning both the impact of climate change on the insurance industry and the industry's
impact on the environment, with particular emphasis on the morbidity and mortality impacts of
climate change and natural disasters. SNL's Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for
climate-related disclosures to the Risk Committee. However, climate issues are monitored both
at the departmental and management levels. The Risk Committee comprises members from
Actuarial, Audit, Accounting, Legal, Human Resources, and various Operations departments.

SNL acknowledges that it is not immune to potential impacts of climate change on its
day-to-day services. Consequently, the Risk Committee meets monthly, during which any
climate-related risks are escalated for discussion. Risk discussions begin within the respective
operational units and are then escalated to the Risk Committee. Depending on the severity of
any climate-related issues, these matters may be further escalated to both the External Board
Member who oversees the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors. The Risk Committee,
particularly its Legal Compliance members, has collaborated with operational leads, including
IT, to develop a business continuity plan in case of a natural disaster. This continuity plan
prioritizes employee safety and provides resources to facilitate remote work while ensuring
continuity of services during challenging periods for our payors and insureds.

STRATEGY

Currently, SNL addresses potential climate-related risks via maintaining its Disaster
Response Plan to mitigate the effects of foreseeable natural disasters, particularly given that a
portion of our workforce is located in regions susceptible to hurricanes and tornadoes. As
mentioned above, our Disaster Response Plan enables our employees to work remotely once
their health and physical safety are confirmed.

As previously stated, SNL strives to stay informed about changes in morbidity and
mortality, including those related to climate change. Such activity ensures accurate pricing and
underwriting, ability to identify emerging health threads that could impact policyholders, the
viability of existing and prospective product offerings, setting of appropriate reserves, which
SNL believes will result in positive customer experience and satisfaction.

SNL is headquartered in Utah, where our building features state-of-the-art low-flush
valves, motion sensors for office lighting, energy-efficient appliances in break rooms and
restrooms, blinds to prevent the greenhouse effect of direct sunlight, recycling facilities on each
floor, and xeriscape landscaping for drought tolerance. Our facilities team continually seeks
opportunities to lower SNL's carbon footprint. Additionally, SNL relocated to a new building in
2022, classified as a Class A commercial space, which meets the growing demand for high-
density workspace in Utah and is conveniently located in the center of Salt Lake County.
Historically, SNL has contributed to a local arboretum that engages in community outreach
programs to educate Utah residents about indigenous and drought-resistant flora. Another
long-term goal for SNL is to reduce its environmental impact by encouraging customer and
agent activities to go paperless through our online solutions. Given the smaller scale of SNL’s
workforce, we typically assess climate-related challenges as they arise, such as transitioning to.
paperless options or purchasing energy-efficient appliances. However, the Risk Committee and
management regularly discuss opportunities for long-term evolution.

RISK MANAGEMENT

SNL's Risk Committee currently focuses on monitoring the impact of climate change on
mortality rates and considering the effects of both man-made and natural disasters on our
operations. SNL recognizes that such events can significantly impact internal operations and the
performance of our underwriting portfolio, including timely payments or surrenders of existing
policies and the sales of new policies.

As with our review of all risks, financial implication and cost-justification of perceived
risk threats is a significant consideration. In the assessment of risk, SNL evaluates the severity
and probability of the risk event occurring. We also identify and classify the risk based on its
nature (e.g. operational, financial, regulatory, or environmental). If there is a significant risk,
the risk event is within SNL's control to mitigate, and it is cost justified, we proceed to develop a
risk mitigation plan. Once the plan has received the proper review and the final version is
prepared, we communicate and train accordingly.

METRICS

At present, SNL does not implement or use catastrophe modeling to manage climate-
related risks to our business. As mentioned above, current climate considerations are limited to
generally accepted ratings, such as “water smart,” which are considered when acquiring items
for our facilities. Similarly, we do not currently track metrics to assess climate-related risks and
opportunities in alignment with our strategy and risk management process.

In conclusion, SNL recognizes the critical importance of monitoring climate-related risks as an
integral part of its operational and strategic framework. By staying vigilant and informed about
the potential impacts of climate change on morbidity and mortality rates, as well as on the
broader industry, SNL ensures it is well-positioned to anticipate and respond to emerging
challenges. Our commitment to regular risk assessment, proactive mitigation strategies, and
robust business continuity planning underscores its dedication to safeguarding both its
policyholders and its financial stability. By embedding climate risk monitoring into its
governance and risk management practices, SNL not only protects its immediate interests but

also contributes to long-term sustainability and resilience in a potentially unpredictable
environment.

In 2023, the Company formed a dedicated ESG Forum (‘the Forum’) to reflect the Company's broader
focus on ESG policies, processes and disclosures, with a direct reporting line to the Executive Committee
and Board of Directors. The Climate Council, a subcommittee of the Forum, is designed to review and
manage climate-related risks and opportunities throughout the business and associated with strategy,
financial planning, underwriting and investment decisions and product development. The cross-functional
membership of the Forum and Climate Council helps embed ESG goals, objectives, and initiatives into the
strategy and operations of the Company. The members of the Forum and Climate Council represent a
myriad of business functions, including Actuarial, Risk, DEI&B, Human Resources, AmTrust International,
Governance and Regulatory Counsel, Legal Counsel, Investments, Operations, Commercial P&C,
Specialty Risk, Compliance, Treasury, Underwriting, Real Estate, and Exposure Management.
At the March 2024 meeting of the Company's Board of Directors, the Chief People & Communications
Officer (""CP&CO"") reporting on the significant development of the Company's first annual sustainability
report (""Business & Sustainability Review"") and then shared the report with the Company's Board of
Directors several weeks later. The Company is also working with a third-party to track baseline Scope 1
and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is developing metrics to establish a benchmark for the
‘Company.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Company's Enterprise Risk Management (""ERM"") function is responsible for monitoring climate-related
risks that impact the Company's insurance business. The Company's Global CRO provides the Company's
Audit Committee with an ERM report each quarter, a portion of which is dedicated to climate risks. A climate
change financial stress is considered in AmTrust's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) summary
reports annually.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment as it relates to natural catastrophe risks is in place
and embedded in ERM. The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee, which identifies new and
changing risks to the business.
Within the quarterly ERM report, risks are identified by category (e.g., financial, operational, strategic,
external and insurance) and sub-category (market, credit, liquidity, etc.) At the business unit level, the risk
management process consists of, but is not limited to, stakeholder discussions with key executives and risk
‘owners, examinations of risk state by risk category, reviews of design and control effectiveness test results,
where deemed necessary. AmTrust’s ERM team members continue to gain skills and knowledge for
assessing and managing climate risks by attending training events, industry events and other forums. The
ERM team uses data from the scientific community and resources provided by the TCFD guidance to advise
the ERM team and keep up to date of potential consequences or opportunities of climate-related impacts.
Two Board members, one of whom is responsible for the oversight of the Company's management of
climate risks, are members of the Company's management Risk Committee and attend the Company's
Audit Committee meetings. The Audit Committee, supported by Intemal Audit, provides independent
assurance on the design and effectiveness of the overall system of intemal control, including risk
management and compliance. Internal Audit is independent of both the business and the ERM function
and reports directly to the Audit Committee

‘+ In 2024, the Company partnered with a third-party to measure groupwide 2023 Scope 1 and
Scope 2 emissions. This was AmTrust's first participation in this measurement exercise, which
provided a clearer understanding of its baseline Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

Hybrid work model:

© The Company's hybrid work model implemented in 2021 also helps to reduce emissions as
employees are driving less mileage to work.

A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
‘medium, and long term.
‘AmTrust is a commercial property and casualty insurance group that focuses on small businesses. The
‘Company provides workers’ compensation coverage and other commercial coverages for small and
medium-sized businesses. The businesses AmTrust insures include restaurants, retail stores, small
artisan contractors and medical and professional offices. The Company also provides coverage to
apartment buildings, condominiums, and hotels. Even though AmTrust is the third largest workers’
‘compensation insurer in the U.S., 96% of its workers’ compensation policies have annual premiums that
are less than $25,000. The Company's other commercial property and casualty lines also target smaller
businesses.
‘AmTrust also is one of the leading warranty insurers in the U.S. The Company provides the insurance
backstop for auto warranties issued by manufacturers and other warranty providers. The Company also
insures warranties on consumer products offered by many leading brands. These products protect tens
of thousands of consumers. The Company does not insure big businesses or high hazard industries.
The Company has identified five core climate-related risk categories by leveraging guidance provided by
independent experts, regulators and the Company's own assessment of which categories are most likely
to elicit a better understanding of the financial risks facing the Company. Within each core risk category,
material risk factors were identified over various time horizons.
Five core climate-related risk categories identified are as follows:
1. Physical Risks
‘+ Description: immediate risks arising from weather-related events and slow onset climate
changes
ee! =;

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
+ Examples:
i. Risks associated with increased claims activity and reserve strengthening across
the various lines of business
1. Short- to long-term: severe storms (Property) and other weather events
(Warranty)
2. Long-term: increasing sea level (Property)
ji, Short- to long-term: extreme weather events may disrupt business continuity by
negatively impacting AmTrust carriers’ infrastructure and systems
2. Investment Risks
‘+ Description: risks arising from the exposure to market value deterioration of investments
driven by a current or expected impact of behavior relating to climate change
+ Examples:

i. Short-term: material and unforeseen drop in the value of an investment
holdings resulting from the perception that the issuer will be negatively
impacted by climate change related events or market activity

ji, Long-term: loss of market confidence in issuer to adapt business model to
address climate change related events or market demands

3. Transition Risks
‘+ Description: financial risks arising from the transition to a lower-carbon economy
including changes to policies, regulations and public perception
+ Examples:

i. Medium- to long-term: lower demand for current product offering distributed
through traditional methods, including auto warranty and the shift away from.
diesel and gas fuel sources

ji, Medium to long-term: lower demand for consumer electronics and major
appliances that do not comply with the market's perception of meeting
adequate environmental standards

iii, Medium- and long-term: introduction of new technologies which render
products currently offered (or insured) by AmTrust as obsolete, requiring a shift
to new products and distribution channels

iv. Medium-term: new policies and regulations that restrict products that are
included in AmTrust's business plan

4. Liability (Litigation) Risks
‘+ Description: risks of actions initiated by claimants who have suffered loss and damage
arising from climate change
+ Examples:

i. Short to medium-term: business partners (including reinsurance
counterparties) introducing strict climate-related minimum standards which
may be onerous

ji, Medium- to long-term: Climate litigation against AmTrust itself or its
policyholders, specifically those covered by its Professional Indemnity and or
any Director & Officer (""D&O"") Insurance policies for failing to avoid or
minimize adverse impacts on the climate, or failing to adapt to climate change

5. Reputational Risks
‘+ Description: risks of negative publicity resulting from support (i.e. investment, partnership,
etc.) in organizations that are seen to exacerbate climate change or perceived inaction by
AmTrust to reverse its practices that are seen to contribute to climate change
+ Examples:
ee! 7

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024

i. Short- to medium-term: Regulatory — Increased scrutiny by regulators as a
result of a real or perceived unmitigated exposure to climate related risks
including those mentioned in the other risk categories

ji, Short- to medium-term: Market confidence — the insurance market (agents,
brokers and policyholders) losing faith in AmTrust due to a real or perceived
unmitigated exposure to climate related risks including those highlighted in the
other risk categories

iii, Short- to medium-term: Rating agencies and other third parties losing faith in
AmTrust's abilty to effectively manage climate change related risks

iv. Medium- to long-term: Losing market share due to an increased desire to work
with companies that take public and proactive steps to combat the causes of
climate change. Given the power of social media, the impact of this risk could
be both rapid and substantial.

v. Short. to medium-term: Talent management — difficulty attracting and retaining
employees due to the Company's negative impact on climate.

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business,

strategy, and financial planning.

‘Two specific areas are being prioritized as they present more risk to AmTrust based on its current strategic

and financial position.

1. Property Insurance: While each line of business AmTrust underwrites is vulnerable to various risk
factors arising from the changing climate, Property insurance is currently seen as the most likely to
experience negative impacts as a result of rising sea levels or changing weather patterns. As described
below in Section C, AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such
as hurricanes, storm surge, inland flooding or wildfires. AmTrust manages its exposure to adverse
weather risks through disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control and
risk transfer. AmTrust's property segment is a small part of its insured portfolio overall
Climate-related losses have not been a material threat to the Company's solvency. AmTrust has a
relatively low exposure to severe weather and catastrophe-type insurance events. AmTrust's insurance
contracts renew annually, which would enable a quick response to changes, as needed, by adjusting
pricing or by restricting exposure.

2. Investment Value Deterioration: AmTrust maintains conservative and diversified investment portfolios

but the market impacts of climate change to companies in which AmTrust invests is difficult to anticipate
and could lead to deteriorations in the valuation of related investment holdings.
The Company has analyzed its investment portfolio to determine what its concentration in fossil fuels
and other carbon-related holdings. The Company's fossil fuel investments comprise less than 10% of
its overall investment portfolio, which is mainly comprised of readily marketable invest ment-grade fixed-
income securities with relatively short duration. As such, climate change risk on the Company's
investment portfolio is currently low due to any impact taking place over a longer time horizon than the
average duration of the portfolio. The Company's corporate bond portfolio is well diversified by sector
and issuer and the impact of climate change, if any, on the creditworthiness of any issuer is insignificant
in the context of the whole portfolio. The Company believes climate risk is tempered by a relatively
short duration portfolio comprised of diverse issuers, which allows the Company to react and reposition
quickly to emerging climate risks.

The Company has taken steps to engage its key constituencies, including policyholders, agents and other

partnerships, on the topic of climate risk and resiliency.

ee! =:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
AmTrust proactively encourages its policyholders to reduce the potential losses caused by climate
influenced events through methods such as:

‘+ Utilization of AmTrust’s highly knowledgeable producer base to provide policyholder education
and guidance on purchasing appropriate coverages needed to mitigate specific risk exposures.

‘+ Policyholder notifications providing loss mitigation strategies and notices for ascertaining
coverage for certain catastrophic coverage through other Federal programs, such as flood
insurance.

+ AmTrust provides online news releases, videos and links to important resources, e.g.
disastersafety.org and Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety...all aimed at proactively
educating and training its customers on potential risk hazards and exposures along with mitigation
analysis, tips and solutions for flood, wind, winter weather, including top convective events

‘+ AmTrust provides Loss Control services that identify various exposures to its policyholders’
property and their ability to produce income that include means of mitigating weather related
losses induced by climate change.

In addition, the Company has ongoing partnerships to support its commitment to appropriately managing
environmental risks.

‘+ Partnered with a third-party to create industry first electric VSC (vehicle service contract) covering
batteries, and have partnered with various other administrators to expand AmTrust's green
footprint.

‘+ Developed and launched service contract program for electric vehicle residential charging station.

‘+ Ongoing research for whole home green infrastructure offerings to bundle coverage for electric
vehicles, at-home charging stations, solar panels, and electricity storage units.

+ AmTrust Title's energy division is dedicated to supporting the growth of clean energy initiatives by
partnering with developers, investors, and lending partners to navigate the unique challenges of
energy project goals. AmTrust's range of energy projects includes wind and solar farms, battery
storage, hydroelectric, hydrogen, liquid nitrogen gas, renewable natural gas, and transmission
lines.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-
related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

Property Insurance -

As the potential for property damage increases because of the changing climate, itis critical to maintain a
strong understanding of the myriad of factors that impact the assessment of properties within AmTrust's
portfolio. The mitigants, as outlined below, explain further the Company's steps to reduce the negative
effects of major catastrophic events.

Mitigants:

‘+ AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such as hurricanes,
storm surge, inland flooding or wildfires. The Company manages its exposure to adverse weather
risks through disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control, and risk
transfer.

‘+ AmTrust considers extreme weather events in pricing and underwriting its insurance products. To
determine the premium associated with the costs of these extreme events the Company relies on
historical storm data, as well as utilizing catastrophe models to supplement this historical data due
to the infrequent nature of extreme weather events

+ ERM’s Exposure Management Team has been regularly performing detailed analysis over the
property and workers’ compensation insurance portfolios for AmTrust as a whole. On a quarterly
basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models.
Hurricane modelled results are based on warm sea surface temperatures catalogues, which
recognize the near/medium term view on sea-surface temperatures, thereby capturing recent
trends. AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year
catastrophe probable maximum loss (""PML"") be protected by reinsurance purchases for property.

ee! =:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
The modelled 1:250-year catastrophe PML for property and workers’ compensation are monitored
against approved risk appetites. In addition, the Company runs Lloyd's Realistic Disaster
‘Scenarios to estimate the potential losses incurred from a variety of hypothetical disaster scenarios,
using consistent and appropriate methods and assumptions.

‘+ AmTrust’s property insurance portfolio is protected by AmTrust's property catastrophe excess of
loss treaty attaching at $70m.

‘+ Climate change financial stress is considered in the Company's ORSA report. The hurricane
exceedance probability curve was adjusted to reflect climate change by increasing the frequency
of hurricane Category 3 events by 15%, Category 4 events by 25%, Category 5 events by 35%,
and increasing storm surge ground up losses by 35%. The post-stress Universal Best's Capital
‘Adequacy Ratio (""BCAR’) is used to assess capital adequacy on a group level. The group's capital
risk appetite is to maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99"" percentile, which
results in a BCAR assessment of “Adequate”. The resulting net loss as measured by the 1:200-
year PML did not have a significant effect on the Company's capital due to the limit of catastrophe
reinsurance purchased.

‘+ No attempt has been made at this time to identify and measure a climate scenario equivalent to
two-degrees of Celsius.

‘+ The Exposure Management function within ERM works closely with the underwriting, actuarial
pricing and ceded reinsurance teams to inform of the adequacy of AmTrust's reinsurance
purchasing as compared to the risk appetites

‘+ The Company's insurance contracts are renewable annually, which would enable the Company to
quickly respond to changes as needed by adjusting its pricing or by restricting its exposure.

‘+ AmTrust’s preference for small risks provides a natural diversification against climate change
catastrophe due to the spread of the risks within and between geographic regions.

‘+ AmTrust manages its coastal wind exposures based on state-specific eligibility criteria reflecting
the building's distance to the coast, construction, as well as the age and condition of the roof.
Underwriting actions have reduced coastal exposures in Florida and along the Gulf Coast to further
mitigate large hurricane events.

‘+ To mitigate its exposure to extreme weather events in hail-prone areas, AmTrust maintains
eligibility requirements on an assessment of the insured vulnerability to damaging hail hazard, plus
the building's characteristics, such as a building's roof area, covering materials, and equipment e.g
HVAC or solar panels,

‘+ Corrective pricing and underwriting measures in Property Northeast have limited exposure growth
to reduce property catastrophe aggregation risk.

Investment Valuations -

The value of the types of financial instruments in which the Company is invested could be significantly
impacted if the market develops a perception that the issuer is either not adequately managing its climate
change risk or is accumulating a competitive disadvantage by not adapting its business strategy.

Mitigants:

‘+ AmTrust has analyzed its investment portfolio to determine the concentration of fossil fuel
investments, as well as other carbon related investments. The Company's fossil fuel investments
comprise less than 10% of its overall group-wide investment portfolio

‘+ The investment portfolio consists of readily marketable investment-grade fixed-income securities
with relatively short duration. As such, climate change risk on the Company's investment portfolio
is currently low due to any impact taking place over a longer time horizon than the average duration
of the portfolio. The Company's corporate bond portfolio is well diversified by sector and issuer and

C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks
are integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.
In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the
following:
+ Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's general enterprise-
risk management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks,

The potential impact to AmTrust’s underwriting portfolio from the increased physical risk potential due to
climate fluctuations are as follows:

‘+ In Coastal areas along the U.S. Eastem coast and Gulf Coast, the potential of climate
fluctuations has a higher hurricane, tropical, extra tropical or noreaster storm event frequency
and severity, which could increase policyholder losses for personal and commercial property
and commercial auto coverages.

‘+ InNon-coastal areas, the potential risk of climate fluctuations is increased convective storm
events or severe weather (winds/derecho/straight-line, hail, flood, tornado, lightning, single day
adverse precipitation event, etc.) causing frequency and severity, which could increase losses
for personal and commercial property and commercial auto coverages. This could result in
higher policyholder losses in any area within the United States, but is at an increased level in

ey! 12

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
states where AmTrust currently has exposure, such as Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Louisiana.

‘+ Apotential risk of climate fluctuations is an increased frequency and severity of wildfire events,
which could increase policyholder losses for commercial property and auto coverages.

‘+ A potential risk of climate fluctuations is increased groundwater withdrawal and drought leading
to land subsidence issues, both inland and coastal, which could increase losses for commercial
property coverages in the lower Midwest and Southeastern states.

+ Reinsurance could become more expensive and scarce if climate induced events become more
frequent and severe.

‘+ AmTrust utilizes industry specific CAT predictive modelling, concentration monitoring tools and
risk management solutions to manage its exposure to climate fluctuations and impacts including
adjusting its guidelines and reinsurance retentions accordingly.

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment is in place and embedded in the ERM process.
The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee comprised of the Group CRO, International CRO, US
Head of Risk and other members of the ERM function. This committee, through the engagement of
management and other research, identifies new and changing risks to the business, tracks their
development and assesses the risk they pose to the Company. These risks are highlighted in the quarterly
ERM report and shared with the Risk Committee.
ERM's Exposure Management Team regularly performs detailed analysis of the property and workers’
‘compensation insurance portfolios. On a quarterly basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures
are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models, with separate modeling for the perils of hurricane, convective
storm, winter storm and wildfire. Hurricane modelled results are based on the warm sea surface
temperature catalogue, which recognize the near/medium term view on sea temperatures and capture the
increased frequency and severity of hurricanes experienced in these warmer periods.
B. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks.
AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, storm
surge, inland flooding or wildfires. The Company manages its exposure to adverse weather risks through
disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control, and risk transfer. AmTrust
considers extreme weather events in pricing and underwriting its insurance products. To determine the
premium associated with the costs of these extreme events AmTrust relies on historical storm data, as well

on an assessment of the insured vulnerability to damaging hail hazard, plus the building's characteristics,
such as a building's roof area, covering materials, and equipment e.g. HVAC or solar panels. AmTrust
utilizes catastrophe models to manage its portfolio's probable maximum losses to these types of extreme
events.
AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year catastrophe PML
be protected by reinsurance purchases for property and workers’ compensation, respectively. The
modelled 1:250-year catastrophe PML for property and workers’ compensation are monitored against
approved risk appetites. In addition, the Company runs Lloyd's Realistic Disaster Scenarios to estimate the

maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99"" percentile which results in a BCAR
assessment of “Adequate”. The 1:200-year PML with the aforementioned adjustments for climate change
did not result in a significant stress to the Company's capital due to the level of reinsurance coverage in
place
The Exposure Management Team works closely with the underwriting, actuarial pricing and ceded
reinsurance teams to inform AmTrust's reinsurance purchasing.
Management of climate-related risks is incorporated into the Company's risk function. The Company is
conducting a core risk assessment and developing a Climate Change Financial Risk Framework (‘the
Framework""). The Framework will be used to monitor exposure to climate change and how it could impact
the resilience of the Company's financial and physical operations.
The Company will consider including additional stress scenarios that simulate potential impacts relating to
climate risks into its ORSA process. Additionally, the Company uses data from the scientific community
and resources provided by the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures to advise its risk
team and keep up to date of potential consequences or opportunities of climate-related impacts that it
incorporates into its risk assessment. This will support strategic decision making by providing
management and the board with a deeper understanding of the impact of a given climate scenario on its
chosen business model and strategy. This is an important step to embed the Framework into the
Company's strategy, governance, and decision-making process.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment is in place and embedded in the general ERM

A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in

line with its strategy and risk management process.

The Company maintains catastrophe risk appetites that are currently defined based on the modelled 1:250-

year catastrophe PMLs (per occurrence). Management monitors that these loss events are protected by

adequate reinsurance structures. Exposure to these events is regularly simulated for the property and

workers’ compensation portfolios. AFSI compares the reinsurance limits and the simulated PML from

realistic disaster scenarios, and also the net loss resulting from a 1:250 year hurricane event as a ratio to

surplus.

‘The Company has started to measure its 2023 Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (""GHG"") emissions

in 2024. Most of AmTrust's Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions come from office activity and company-

‘owned/controlled mobile combustion sources. The Company has not set any GHG emissions reduction

targets but plans on developing strategies to mitigate emissions.

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and

the related risks.

The Company is beginning to measure its baseline Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. AmTrust

aims to partner with a third party to measure and validate its emissions and plans to disclose next year.

C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and

performance against targets.

‘AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year catastrophe

PMLs be protected by reinsurance purchases for property and workers’ compensation, respectively. On

a quarterly basis, the modelled 1:250 year catastrophe PMLs for property and workers’ compensation are

monitored against this target. AmTrust's catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance purchases annually

correspond to the 1:250-year hurricane PML.

2023,2023_Selective Insurance Company of New York.pdf,"INTRODUCTION
Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (“Selective,” “we,” “us,” or “our’) is a New Jersey insurance
holding company incorporated in 1977 that owns ten property and casualty insurance
subsidiaries (""Insurance Subsidiaries""). The Insurance Subsidiaries sell products and
services only in the United States (""U.S."") and exclusively through independent insurance
agents and wholesale brokers.
We have four reportable segments, each potentially impacted by climate-related risks or
events:
Standard Commercial Lines: This segment's underwriting risk appetite is focused on
small-to-medium sized accounts, with risks weighted more towards low- to medium-hazard
than high-hazard. Standard Commercial Lines provides insurance products and services to
commercial enterprises, typically businesses, non-profit organizations, and local government
agencies. This business represented 73% of ""Total revenues’ in 2023.
Standard Personal Lines: This segment provides insurance products and services to
individuals (primarily auto and homeowners insurance) acquiring coverage in the standard
marketplace. This business represented 9% of our “Total revenues"" in 2023. Our Personal
Lines segment also includes flood insurance coverage sold through the Write Your Own
(‘WY0"") program of the National Flood Insurance Program (""NFIP""). Based on 2023 direct
premiums written, we are the fourth-largest writer of this coverage through the NFIP.
Excess and Surplus Lines (""E&S”): This segment comprises commercial property and
casualty insurance products and services provided to customers unable to obtain coverage
in the standard marketplace, generally because of unusual or higher-risk exposures. This
business represented 9% of “Total revenues’ in 2023.
Investments: This segment represents 9% (including net realized and unrealized gains and
losses) of “Total revenues” and invests the (i) premiums our Insurance Subsidiaries collect
and (i) amounts generated through our capital management strategies, which include the
issuance of debt and equity securities.

OVERVIEW OF OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING CLIMATE RISKS.
Our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard Personal Lines, and E&S segments issue
policies that cover thousands of individuals and businesses against the financial impact of
insured losses, including catastrophic events. We support economic growth by providing our

1

policyholders the contingent capital that gives them the peace of mind and confidence to
take economic risk and protect them and their communities.
Changing climate conditions increase the unpredictability of weather-related loss frequency
and severity, posing a long-term risk to our customers’ lives and livelihoods — and our
business. We aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change by (i) prudently overseeing and
managing catastrophe risk exposure, (ii) helping our customers through responsive claims
handling, risk management services, and proactive weather alerts, (iii) preparing for the
continuing transition to clean energy, and (iv) reducing our carbon footprint. Understanding
and helping mitigate climate change perils for our business and customers is core to our
operations and strategy.
Our understanding of changing climate conditions permits us to develop products and
services that increase customer resiliency and respond to evolving customer needs.
Over the medium- to long-term, we believe that the economic transition to a low-carbon
future creates new business opportunities in emerging industries, such as those associated
with renewable energy and related construction projects.
Our Investments segment incorporates sustainability considerations into our robust
investment due diligence processes. To establish appropriate sustainability investment
governance, we maintain (i) a well-diversified portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset
classes and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and
maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. In addition, we work
with our third-party investment managers to ensure they incorporate sustainability guidelines
and protocols into their investment process while managing our mandates.
We believe our climate change-related efforts (i) demonstrate our corporate responsibility to
help mitigate the impact of climate change and (ii) reward our shareholders with sustained
superior financial and operating performance over time.
We have embraced the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) for the four core elements of an organization's climate approach: (i)
Governance, (ii) Strategy, (iii) Risk Management, and (iv) Metrics & Targets. This report
outlines our initiatives and progress in each of these areas.
Governance
Board Oversight: Our board's oversight of climate-related risks and
opportunities.
Our Board of Directors oversees our Enterprise Risk Management (‘ERM"") process, which
includes identifying, assessing, and managing risks related to climate change. The Board
has six standing committees that oversee and report to the full Board on certain major risks,
2

including climate risk. Our Board's Risk Committee meets at least quarterly and is
responsible for helping the Board oversee and monitor our ERM function, including climate
change-related risks and oversight of our reinsurance program.
All Board committees oversee risks specific to their supervisory areas, and report their
activities and findings to the entire Board. For example, the Finance and Investments
Committee oversees management's incorporation of Environmental, Social, and
Governance (“ESG"") considerations into their due diligence and investment decision-making
process; and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (""“CGNC"") oversees
how management addresses sustainability trends.
The Board also oversees how we set our overall strategy, including monitoring and
addressing climate risks and opportunities.
Management: Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related
risks and opportunities.
Our senior leadership team implements our strategy, including assessing and pursuing
climate change-related business opportunities. The Executive Risk Committee (""ERC""),
chaired by our Chief Risk Officer (‘CRO’), is responsible for operational oversight of climate-
related risks. The ERM unit is responsible for assessing and managing climate change-
related financial risks. We describe the roles of the ERC and ERM unit below.
Executive Risk Committee:
Our ERC, which includes our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), his direct reports, the CRO,
and other key functional leaders, provides management oversight of the ERM function. The
ERC is responsible for the holistic evaluation and supervision of our risk profile and
determines future risk management actions supporting our overall risk appetite. Several
other management committees are responsible for the detailed analysis and management of
various individual risks, some of which are climate related. At least quarterly, the ERC
reviews all major risks.
For example, the ERM unit reports our modeled results for hurricane losses (our peak
catastrophe risk peril in more severe loss scenarios), gross and net of reinsurance in our
quarterly Reinsurance Risk Scorecard provided to the ERC and Board's Risk Committee.
ERM Unit:
The ERM unit, led by the CRO, is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and
reporting key individual and aggregated enterprise-wide risks. The CRO chairs the Emerging
Risk Committee and Market Security Committee (""MSC"") and is a member of the
Management Investment Committee (“MIC’), the Large Claims Committee, and the
Underwriting Committee. The CRO attends the quarterly Reserve Committee presentation,
3

quarterly Disclosure Committee meetings, and various other senior management leadership
meetings. These management committees and functions are responsible for monitoring
various risks, including climate-related risks, described further in this report's Risk
Management section.
The ERM unit is actively involved in climate-related issues, such as catastrophe exposure
coverages and pricing. The ERM unit also manages our economic capital model and
integrates catastrophe exposure into our holistic view of enterprise risk and capital
management.
The Graph below illustrates our three levels of corporate governance of Enterprise Risk
Management:

Compensation and Human Capital Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee, Finance and Investments Committee, and Risk Committee.

Climate Risks
1. Increased model uncertainty around severe weather events resulting from
potentially higher catastrophe loss activity (short-term)
The insurance industry has used traditional catastrophe risk models for decades to
inform underwriting strategy. A significant component of climate risk is that the frequency
and severity of extreme weather events may evolve differently than historical levels —
leading to increased model uncertainty. Our third-party modeling providers are starting to
develop models incorporating forward-looking climate variables. Later in this report we
discuss how we mitigate this uncertainty.
5

2. Potential investment losses from climate risk-related impacts (medium-
term)
We maintain (i) a well-diversified investment portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset
classes and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and
maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. Our investment
portfolio is exposed to climate change risk through (i) direct physical loss to assets and
infrastructure from catastrophic loss activity and (ji) transition risk related to technology
and energy production advances that could lead to stranded assets in certain carbon-
intensive sectors.
Physical investment risks: Climate-related catastrophic losses can cause business
disruption, destroy capital, increase costs to recover from disasters, reduce revenue,
and cause population displacement and migration. These, in turn, can lead to lower
residential and commercial property values, household wealth, and corporate
profitability, which can create financial and credit market losses impacting insurer asset
values.
Transition investment risks: These arise from society's transition towards a low-carbon
economy, driven by policy and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, and
shifting sentiment and societal preferences. This transition towards renewable energy
sources may lead to stranded assets in areas such as the fossil fuel and automotive
industries. Further, it could result in higher infrastructure reinvestment and replacement
costs and increased litigation against carbon-intensive industries. Transition risks may
lead to corporate asset devaluation and lower corporate profitability, property values,
and household wealth, creating financial and credit market losses impacting insurer
asset values.

3. Insurance market transition risk (medium-term)
Increased climate-related regulations and evolving consumer preferences could change
manufacturing and construction methods. As an insurer of small- and mid-sized
businesses in the construction, mercantile, and manufacturing sectors, we could
‘experience reduced demand for specific products. While we have minimal direct
underwriting exposure to environmentally hazardous classes of business, changing
societal preferences and climate change regulations may impact our customers.

4, Regulatory risk (medium-term)
Insurance regulations could limit our flexibility in reducing exposure to certain lines of
business most vulnerable to climate change. While our Personal Lines segment

6

represented 9% of “Total revenues” in 2023, it is subject to significant state regulation,
that limits our flexibility to exit lines quickly if results meaningfully deteriorate. We also
may not receive regulatory approvals for adequate rate levels reflecting catastrophe loss
‘exposure within our products. There is also a risk of expanded climate-related state and
federal disclosure requirements.

5. Climate change impact on frequency and severity of weather events (long-
term)
The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) is an
international body responsible for assessing climate change science. In 2021, the IPCC
estimated in its “Sixth Assessment Report: Physical Science Basis” that human activities
(i) have caused approximately 1.1°C of global warming to date above pre-industrial
levels and (ii) this could rise to an increase between 1.2°C and 3.0°C above pre-
industrial levels between 2041 and 2060. Climate change models also project significant
differences in global regional warming above pre-industrial levels, depending on future
levels of climate mitigation and geographic location. These global regional differences,
whether attributable to nature or human activities, include increases in (i) mean
temperature in most land and ocean regions, (ii) hot extremes in most inhabited regions,
(ii) heavy precipitation in several regions, and (iv) the probability of drought and
precipitation deficits in some regions. These temperature changes can impact weather
patterns and the frequency and/or severity of catastrophes, including hurricanes,
wildfires, severe convective storms, and flooding — all of which could cause our
catastrophe losses to increase relative to historical levels.

6. Reinsurance risk (long-term)
The availability, quality, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions,
including traditional privately placed reinsurance, retrocessional reinsurance, and
catastrophe bond market capacity. Most of our reinsurance contracts have annual terms.
Consequently, reinsurance costs may fluctuate significantly, not necessarily correlating
to the loss experience of our specific book of business. State insurance regulators
generally permit us to consider catastrophe reinsurance expense in our filed rates and
rating plans. However, the conditions and timing of regulatory approval may not align
with the actual expense of new reinsurance terms. Disproportionate increases in our
reinsurance expense that we cannot include in our filed rates and rating plans will
reduce our earings. If we cannot negotiate desired reinsurance amounts or terms, we
may experience increased reinsurance expense and increased risk retention on
individual or aggregate claim losses that could limit our ability to write future business.

Climate Opportunities

1. Producing renewable energy (short-term)
Selective strongly believes in a clean energy future. We built ground-mount and garage-
canopy solar photovoltaic facilities at our corporate headquarters. The facilities can
generate approximately five million kWh of electricity annually, and we sell the related
solar renewable energy credits to others. As we sell these solar renewable energy
credits to others, our GHG emissions are not offset — but we are invested in cleaner
energy production.

2. Enhancing customer resiliency (short-term)
Helping our customers prepare for severe weather events mitigates loss activity.
Examples include proactive messaging and outreach before catastrophic weather events
and risk management services, including risk evaluations, internet-based risk
management educational resources, and thermographic infrared surveys that help
strengthen our customer relationships. We are also evaluating value-added services and
technologies within our Standard Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments to
enhance customer resiliency, such as our newly rolled out Risk Management Center
found on our website and our partnerships with LeakBot and Phyn for intelligent water
solutions.

3. Providing products and services to lower customers’ carbon footprint
(short-term)
We recognize that customer demand for climate-friendly products and services may
increase, and we see opportunities to provide these services to our customers. We
describe programs we have implemented in the Impact of Risks and Opportunities on
Businesses, Strategy, and Financial Planning section below.

4, Investment Opportunities (short-term)
Selective currently invests in green bonds and energy-transition-related infrastructure
instruments. In addition, we invest in tax credit transactions that help encourage the
installation of solar energy systems.

5. Developing new insurance products tailored to emerging industries
(medium-term)
As part of an economic transition to a low-carbon future, we expect new technologies,
infrastructure, and processes to be introduced — all of which will require insurance

8

coverage. We believe that, over time, this will present a sizeable business opportunity. In
the following sections, we describe how new product development is a component of our
business strategy.
6. Additional investment opportunities (long-term)
We believe the transition to a low-carbon economy will provide new investment
‘opportunities, such as green bonds or investments in energy-transition-related
infrastructure instruments. These investment opportunities could increase our
diversification of financial assets. As the clean energy sector grows and matures, we
‘expect to continue to invest in new assets that support the transition to a low-carbon
‘economy.
Impact of Risks and Opportunities on Businesses, Strategy, and Financial
Planning: The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our
businesses, strategy, and financial planning.
The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our underwriting and investment
segments follows.
Underwriting
The principal impact of climate change on our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard
Personal Lines, and E&S business is the potential for greater frequency and/or severity of
insured property catastrophic loss activity.
Catastrophe Risk Management
The ERM function models and monitors catastrophe risk, including the ongoing assessment
of catastrophe risks within our pre-determined limits. Our underwriting and risk management
frameworks employ risk mitigation tools, including:
1. Comprehensive underwriting standards;
2. Limits on coastal property exposure;
3. Risk-sharing through (a) use of appropriate wind/weather-related deductibles, and
(b) prudent reinsurance placements with high-quality third parties;
4. Modeling and managing our catastrophe risk aggregations; and
5. Active oversight from senior management and the Board of Directors.

Due to our business risk profile and geographic concentration in the Northeast and Mid-
Atlantic states, hurricane risk is our portfolio’s most significant natural catastrophe peril
‘exposure. This risk influenced our decision to diversify our underwriting portfolio
geographically and set rigorous coastal property exposure guidelines. The following
depiction of our property writings in 2002, 2012, and 2023 shows our book's geographical
diversification as we have grown the business.
The table below illustrates results of our efforts to diversify our premium geographically.

We review our hurricane risk exposure using third-party vendor models and conducting our
proprietary analysis. The third-party vendor models provide a long-term view that closely
relates modeled event frequency to historical hurricane activity. However, climate change
may cause hurricane frequency and severity to differ from historical levels. In the short- to
medium-term, we mitigate this risk by purchasing significant reinsurance protection and
setting our retained loss thresholds at levels well below the amounts we believe would
cause significant financial stress. In the medium- to longer-term, we expect to continually
evolve our risk modeling and stress thresholds based on scientific and modeling advances.
We incorporate these modeled catastrophe loss expectations within our pricing plans and
have underwriting guidelines reflecting our catastrophe exposure appetite. Modeled results
are reported to the MSC and impact our reinsurance purchasing and strategic growth
decisions.
10

In addition to managing our peak hurricane exposure risk, we seek to manage our
‘exposures to other perils, such as severe convective storms, winter storms, flooding, and
wildfires. By building a geographically diverse book of business, implementing strong
underwriting guidelines, conducting risk modeling, and purchasing reinsurance, we seek to
manage our exposure to these types of losses.

In our standard commercial lines segment, we look to our insureds to retain an appropriate
level of risk in wind/hail exposure states to severe convective storms through the use of
wind/hail deductibles and use of endorsements that put limitations on coverage for roof
surfacing including for cosmetic damage or determining roof surfacing values on an actual
cash value basis. In our Personal Lines segment, we implement mandatory wind/hail
deductibles in states exposed to severe convective storms, where allowed by law.
Opportunities

In the short term, we have several initiatives aimed at helping customers lower their carbon
footprint and increase their resiliency to catastrophic losses.

+ We send messages to our customers, helping them prepare for severe weather
events. For example, we send weather preparation notices for large storms or
hurricanes, including guides on structural improvements, roof and drainage
maintenance, and measures to prevent clogged or frozen plumbing and sprinkler
systems.

+ Our field-based Risk Management Specialists visit the business locations of certain
current and potential commercial lines customers to conduct safety evaluations. Risk
Management staff provide risk mitigation recommendations to improve worker safety
and limit potential property losses, such as from flood, wind, or fire.

+ We are a member company that supports the Insurance Institute for Business &
Home Safety (“IBHS"") and regularly leverage its research to help our customers,
distribution partners, and internal staff further their knowledge to mitigate severe
weather losses. We have in person events as well as a library of training courses
available.

+ Our GreenPAC® endorsement allows Commercial Lines policyholders (within the
coverage limits) to repair or replace covered loss property damage using building
materials, components, products, equipment, construction and design methods, and
technologies that reduce environmental impact by conserving energy, water, and
other natural resources.

+ We have enhanced our commercial Automobile ElitePac® coverage form to include
a green automobile replacement coverage. Similar to our GreenPAC® commercial

1

property endorsement, this coverage permits policyholders to replace their insured
auto after a total loss with a hybrid or electric vehicle within the coverage limits.

+ We are assessing the incorporation of value-added services within our Commercial
Lines, Personal Lines, and Flood operations that will better prepare our customers
for potentially heightened environmental and climate risks. In 2024, we launched our
new Risk Management Center in the MySelective app and on our website for
Commercial Lines customers, which features online assessments, expert support,
and on-demand training. The Risk Management Center allows us to more broadly
provide resources to insureds.

In the medium-term, we continue to actively evaluate modifications to our existing coverages
and increase our product suite to match our expected new areas of insurance coverage
demand. As a significant writer of contractors and small manufacturing risks, we believe
Selective is well-positioned to support growing market share opportunities from new low-
carbon construction processes. Providing insurance capacity to renewable energy
production facilities and related construction projects would be a longer-term growth
opportunity.
Investments
Our investment portfolio is exposed to climate change risk through (i) direct physical loss to
assets and infrastructure from catastrophic loss activity and (ii) transition risk related to
technology and energy production advances that could lead to stranded assets in certain
carbon-intensive sectors.
Physical risks: Our investment managers take a conservative approach when investing in
commercial and residential real estate products that are potentially vulnerable to climate
change-related risks. As of December 31, 2023, around 70% of our residential mortgage-
backed securities were government agency-backed. We generally invest in the top tranches
of commercial mortgage-backed securities, with ample support to protect against losses
from property value declines.
Transition risk: We also monitor our exposure to specific carbon-intensive sectors defined
by the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) as vulnerable to longer-
term climate change transition risks. As of December 31, 2023, sectors we identified in our
corporate fixed income portfolio as carbon-intensive represented less than 5% of our total
invested assets. The identified sectors and their associated percentage of invested assets
are Automotive (0.4%), Aviation (0.6%), Cement (0.0%), Coal Mining (0.0%), Oil and Gas
(1.5%), Power Generation (1.6%), Shipping (0.0%), and Steel (0.1%).

The table above compares corporate fixed income portfolio Carbon Intensive Sector
exposure for 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Integrating ESG into our Investment Process:
We incorporate ESG considerations into our investment process. To establish appropriate
ESG investment governance, we work with our third-party investment managers to ensure
they have ESG guidelines and protocols in their investment process while managing our
mandates.
We also are not making any new direct debt or equity investments in thermal coal
enterprises, including companies that generate 30% or more of (i) their revenue from the
‘ownership, exploration, mining, or refining of thermal coal or (ii) their electricity generation
from thermal coal.
Resilience of Strategy Considering Climate-Related Scenarios: The resilience
of our strategy taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios,
including a 2°C or lower scenario.
Evaluating perils with different return periods is crucial to identifying, assessing, and
managing climate-related risks that influence our business strategy. Modeled estimates
provide a range of potential outcomes. We review multiple models from various vendors
over several time periods to understand our catastrophic risk, including physical risks that
may materialize more frequently because of climate change. We manage our catastrophe
risk conservatively, adjusting third-party vendor models to reflect assumptions for certain un-
13

modeled costs, such as the impact of loss expenses, residual market assessments, and
automobile-related losses.
Our current catastrophe reinsurance program exhausts at approximately a 1-in-260-year
return period. As of December 31, 2023, we estimated net exposure to a 1-in-250-year
(0.4% probability of exceedance) hurricane event to equal 4% of our GAAP equity, within our
established risk tolerance and unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

We assess the resilience of our strategy to mitigate climate-related risks quantitatively,
through natural catastrophe modeling, and qualitatively. Based on our assessment, we are
more vulnerable to physical climate risks than transitional risks. Accordingly, more severe
warming scenarios will likely increase catastrophe risk. Our primary exposure to transitional
risk is through our investment portfolio, where the percentage of fixed income assets
invested in carbon-intensive sectors was less than 5% of total assets as of December 31,
2023.
Our mix of business and underwriting approach has historically resulted in less of an impact
from catastrophe losses than the P&C insurance industry average (shown in the graph
14

below). We will continue to evaluate climate scenario analysis as a tool to complement our
catastrophe risk scenario analysis as industry guidance and models evolve.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Processes for Identifying and Assessing Climate-related Risks: Our processes
for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
Selective has a robust ERM framework that includes identifying and assessing our most,
significant risks through a combination of quantitative analysis and metrics and qualitative
assessment. Our ERM unit identifies and assesses physical, transition, and liability risks
related to climate change.
Our ERM framework includes an emerging risk management component led by a
designated Emerging Risk Committee. This committee identifies and monitors new and
evolving risk issues that may significantly impact our financial performance, reputation, or
long-term strategy. The Emerging Risk Committee has identified climate change as a “high”
level emerging risk, reviewing it at least quarterly with the ERC and our Board's Risk
Committee. The ERM unit, the ERC, and other specific employees stay informed on key
15

climate change risk developments through industry publications, webinars, conferences, and
regular engagement with outside sources, such as our reinsurance brokers, investment
managers, and trade associations.
The ERM unit evaluates our catastrophe risk exposure relative to our established
tolerances. This evaluation incorporates the results of third-party vendor models and
proprietary analysis in its review of exposure to hurricanes and other perils on both a gross
and net basis.
The table below shows the gross and net losses modeled results by peril of our underwriting
property portfolio as of July 1, 2023, The table highlights hurricane peril as our most

+ Net losses are after-tax loses net of catastrophe reinsurance treaty, effective Jonuary 1, 2024, including reinstatement premiums.
We currently do not write crop insurance, have minimal exposure to private flood, and have
a small geographic footprint in the Western U.S., so our exposures to perils such as
droughts, wildfires, and flooding, tend to be relatively modest.
On the investment side, we monitor our exposure to carbon-intensive industries to measure
our vulnerability to climate-related risks from the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Processes for Managing Climate-related Risks: Our processes for managing
climate-related risks.
Underwriting
In managing physical climate-related risks to our insurance business, we model our property
portfolio for hurricanes and other wind events semi-annually, as of July and January.
Earthquake risk, which presents significantly lower exposure for our portfolio, is modeled
each July.
16

Annually, our Reinsurance team works closely with our reinsurance broker to produce an in-
depth analysis of the modeled results, which the MSC reviews.
We use various authority levels as underwriting controls for significant individual property
risks and large property accounts that could create or exacerbate a property aggregation
issue. If any individual location exceeds the Chief Underwriting Officer's property limit
authority, it must be approved by the Underwriting Committee (comprised of the Standard
Lines Chief Operating Officer, CFO, Standard Commercial Lines Chief Underwriting Officer,
Executive Vice President of E&S Lines, and CRO). When considering large property
accounts, the Underwriting Committee typically reviews an evaluation of property
aggregations in the particular county and state, projecting the marginal impact the specific
risk has on our aggregate modeled losses. The evaluation includes analysis of catastrophe
risk aggregation appetite and appropriate pricing for assuming the increased risk
aggregation.
We believe that we have created an effective control environment for managing natural
catastrophe risk on a gross exposure basis by (i) setting overall portfolio growth
expectations, (ii) monitoring actual results and property aggregations, (iii) having appropriate
underwriting authority controls around our largest accounts, and (iv) consistently focusing on
appropriate pricing of catastrophe risk.
Property insurance is our primary climate-related insurance operations risk. However, we
have potential climate-related claims under liability policies, such as directors’ and officers’
(""D&O"") liability insurance policies. We monitor these liability risks, but partially mitigate our
liability-related climate exposure through our (i) D&O appetite selection, which excludes
public companies and financial institutions, (ji) focus on business with small regional
footprints and without environmentally-hazardous risks, and (ii) reinsurance, should there
be a claim in excess of our $2 million casualty reinsurance retention.
Investments
Our internal investment team and external investment managers execute our investment
strategy and objectives. The MIC is responsible for (i) setting and implementing the
investment objectives and asset allocation, (ii) administering investment policies, (ii)
selecting qualified external investment managers and advisors, and (iv) monitoring
performance, transactions, and specific risk metrics, including those related to climate
change.
Operational Continuity
In addition to mitigating underwriting and investment risk, we have robust plans to ensure
operational continuity during unforeseen or catastrophic events. We have Business
Continuity Plans for our key data processing facility (Disaster Recovery Plan), the leadership
team (Executive Crisis Management Plan), and critical operational areas. We review,

7

update, and test these plans at least annually. Testing includes “tabletop” exercises and
planned hands-on tests.

Integration into Overall Risk Management: Our processes for identifying,
assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into our overall
risk management.

Because we are in the business of assuming risk, our management of climate-related risks
naturally integrates into our existing ERM framework.

We categorize our major risks into five broad categories:

1. Asset risk, which primarily stems from our investment portfolio and reinsurance
recoverables, including credit and market risk;

2. Underwriting risk, or the risk our insured losses exceed our expectations, including:
a. Losses from inadequate loss reserves;

b. Larger than expected non-catastrophe current accident year losses; and
c. Catastrophe losses that exceed our expectations or our reinsurance treaty limits.

3. Liquidity risk, or the risk we will be unable to meet our contractual obligations as they
become due because we cannot liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding without
incurring unacceptable investment losses or borrowing expenses;

4. Other risks, which include a broad range of operational risks, many challenging to
quantify, such as talent/human capital, market conditions, economic, legal,
regulatory, reputational, and strategic risks — and the risks of fraud, human failure,
modeling, inadequate business continuity plans, or failure of controls or systems,
including cybersecurity risk; and

5. Emerging risks, which can include risks in all categories that are new, rapidly
evolving, or increasing substantially compared to historical levels. For example, we
consider (i) heightened levels of economic and social inflation, (ii) the enactment of
reviver statutes for abuse victims, (iii) climate change, (iv) the increased threat of
cyber incidents, and (v) the increased use of artificial intelligence all to be emerging
risks.

risks.

ler [ sx] fo tT tT tT ft tet
Climate-related risks can impact these risk categories in a variety of ways. For example, asset
risk includes climate-related risks in our investment portfolio overseen by the MIC, and
underwriting risk includes catastrophe risk overseen by the MSC.
METRICS & TARGETS.
Metrics: Our metrics assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with
our strategy and risk management process.
Selective measures and reports on climate risks and opportunities in several different ways.
Our chief metrics and targets are the following:
1. Probability of hurricane losses and capital exposed
Our established catastrophic risk tolerance requires that we expose no more than 10%
of stockholders’ equity to a hurricane loss event at a 99.6% confidence level (1-in-250
year event or 0.4% probability) on a net of reinsurance and after-tax basis. For context,
Superstorm Sandy in 2012 was the largest tropical cyclone event in Selective’s history.
Net of reinsurance and after-tax basis, our Superstorm Sandy loss was approximately
3% of our prior year stockholders’ equity.
In addition to the 1-in-250-year modeled event, we evaluate the impact of several other
scenarios on stockholders’ equity. The table below projects hurricane losses, gross and
net of reinsurance, from the following scenarios:
+ Stochastic catastrophe modeling of our portfolio (1-in-100, 1-in-200, ete.);
+ Recasts of two large hurricanes that impacted our geographic footprint:
© 1938 New England Hurricane, one of the largest hurricanes to impact the
Northeast United States; and
19

© Hurricane Hazel, a Category 4 storm that made landfall near the border
between North Carolina and South Carolina in 1954; and
+ Realistic disaster scenarios (""RDS"") for significant potential storms in the Northeast
and the Carolinas based on Lloyds of London methodology:

We are within our established catastrophic risk tolerance as the table above reflects.
2. Capital allocation away from specifically environmentally hazardous classes of
business
Included below are targets and objectives that we have established for our Underwriting and
Investments segments:
+ We do not underwrite specific environmentally hazardous risks related to production
from coal mines, thermal coal plants, or oil sands extraction.
+ We do not invest in any new direct debt or equity of companies generating more than
30% of their revenues from thermal coal mining or electricity produced from coal.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Related Risks: Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if
appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and related risks.
We track our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions. However, as an
insurance holding company, we are a low greenhouse gas emitter relative to entities in many
other industries. Our Scope 1 emissions include consumption of natural gas, diesel,
20

refrigerant, and the fuel employees use for work travel in company cars. Our Scope 2
emissions consist of our electricity usage.
The table below summarizes our Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions across our operations and
does not include emissions from investment portfolio holdings, including limited
partnerships. For 2023, our overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions are down approximately 3%
compared to our 2019 baseline year. We chose 2019 as our baseline because the COVID-
19 pandemic significantly reduced office occupancy in 2020 and 2021, limiting our Scope 1
and 2 CO2 emissions.

“Our 2021 Scope 1 data has been restated to include an update to HFC-134A,
Since 2019, we have expanded our Commercial Lines footprint by three states, increased
‘employee count by approximately 10%, and grown net premiums written at a 10%
compound annual rate. Emissions remain below our 2019 reported baseline year despite
‘our growth.
To help calculate our GHG emissions, we engaged a third-party multinational engineering
firm specializing in energy management. Our 2019-2023 GHG inventory is consistent with
the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (GHG
Protocol).
Our only owned office location is our approximately 300,000 square foot headquarters in
Branchville, New Jersey, where we directly measure our GHG emissions. We lease 20 other
office locations (approximately 273,000 square feet), and we estimate these locations’ GHG
emissions based on square foot occupancy. We can generate approximately five milion
kWh of solar energy annually at our Branchville location, but we sell the renewable energy
credits to others, so our GHG emissions are not reduced.
2

Targets: The targets we use to manage climate-related risks and opportunities
and performance against targets.
We expect to continue to reduce our carbon emissions over the long term, and we have
initiatives expected to reduce GHG emissions similarly. Some include:
+ Upgrading our corporate headquarters building management system, which should reduce
heating and cooling natural gas consumption;
+ Re-designing work spaces to create more efficiencies and collaboration;
+ Reducing the use of paper with distribution partners;
+ Making efforts to transition our fleet from gasoline to hybrid vehicles; and
+ Migrating our information technology systems to the cloud.
We have also implemented additional initiatives at our corporate headquarters to lower our
environmental impact, including:
+ Enhanced waste management and recycling;
+ Recent LED conversion of all corporate headquarters light bulbs;
+ Hybrid work schedule;
+ Re-purposing commingled recyclables;
+ Installed electric vehicle charging stations for employee use;
+ Eliminating Styrofoam products in our cafeteria;
+ Recycling and more efficient energy use of electronic equipment; and
+ Reducing our water usage through automatic plumbing features.
Conclusion
We believe Selective is well positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy over
time. This TCFD report underscores our commitment to transparency and robust
management of climate-related risks and opportunities. Over the coming years, we will
continue to refine our approach, engage with stakeholders, and report on our progress.
By embedding sustainable initiatives into key aspects of our business, we have
delivered significant value over time for our shareholders by serving our internal and
external stakeholders.

with climate-related financial risks being a factor considered when making
investment management decisions.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer’s strategy, taking into consideration different
climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

* The Company adheres to a rigorous, long-term approach to manage and
monitor its exposure to weather-related catastrophes, some of which may have
increased in frequency or severity due to climate-related risk. The primary goal
of the Company’s risk management framework is to ensure the outcomes of
activities involving climate-related risk remained consistent with the Company's
risk appetite and risk tolerance levels, while maintaining an appropriate balance
between risk and reward. Although the Company's catastrophe risk models
cannot accurately account for material risks arising from specific degrees
Celsius of warming global temperatures with a high level of confidence, the
Company attempts to calibrate its catastrophe risk-models to account for
current and prospective climate conditions.

RISK MANAGEMENT
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.

In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks,

insurers should consider including the following:

underwriting portfolio, and how the company is managing its underwriting exposure
with respect to physical, transition and liability risk. *
© The Company relies upon the availability and quality of reinsurance, near-term

catastrophe risk models, and underwriting guidelines to manage the impact and
underwriting exposure of climate-related risks upon the Company's
underwriting portfolio. The Company accounts for aggregated risk due to
climate-change on a group-wide basis using its ERM framework and coordinates
its activities with FFH’s global risk committee. In addition, the Company relies
upon the relativity short-terms of insurance policies most exposed to climate-
related risks, such as property insurance. The Company evaluates, and intends
to continue evaluating, liability risks arising from climate-related risk.

* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage
their potential physical and transition climate related risks, if applicable. *

reinsurance and primary risk marketplaces: (c) regulatory signals; and (di
feedback from loss control inspections. The Company conducted stress
tests that assessed the financial implications of catastrophes.

B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.

* The Company's ERM framework and Corporate Risk Committee take a group-
wide approach to manage risk, including climate-related risk, in coordination
with FFH’s global risk committee and ERM framework. The Company uses
modeling and judgement to assign a probability of a climate-related risk
negatively affecting the underwriting performance of a business unit, with such
climate-related risks being weighed against non-climate-related material risks
relevantto the business unit, such as credit risk, market risk, and premium and
reserve risk. The Company then seeks to balance the overall risks of the retained
risk in the insurance portfolio to maintain profitability of the Company.

C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related
risks are integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management. In describing how
processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are

Climate Risk Disclosure Survey

Reporting Yar 202 SENIOR LIFE
Preface

Senior Life Insurance Company (“Company”) is a final expense life insurance company based
out of Thomasville, Georgia. The Company occupies 12 acres of land and has one physical
location at | Senior Life Lane, Thomasville, GA 31792. The Company employes approximately
300 people at any given time and utilizes an independent agent system for most sales operations.
The Company was originally known as Provident Security Life Insurance Company. Provident
Security was incorporated in 1970 and wrote policies to the employees of a trucking firm in
Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and South Carolina up until the early
1980's. It was acquired by the current holding company in 2000, before changing the name to
Senior Life.

The geographical location of the company is Southwest Georgia, approximately 35 miles North
of Tallahassee, FL.

Governance

The Company is solely responsible for the creation and implementation of governance regarding
climate-related risks and opportunities. The Company designates the Chief Operations Officer
(“COO”) to identify and oversee possible climate risk exposure; in addition to presenting
relevant findings to the Board of Directors (“Board”).

The Board is comprised of various individuals with financial, actuarial, and regulatory
backgrounds that can accurately assess the impact of climate-related financial risks. Findings
presented to the board must include due diligence research of regulatory and financial concepts
pertaining to the climate-related opportunity, or risk. The COO should continuously monitor and
disclose any climate-related risks associated with any action taken by the Board or executive
officers.

Strategy

The Company annually reviews short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals pertaining to
climate related initiatives. During such reviews, internal reports are utilized to quantify the
results of actions taken in reference to the previously outlined goals. Once such example are
reports that highlight electricity usage and energy-inefficient fixed assets. These reports are used
to measure the economic and ecological advantages of implementing energy-efficient
electronics, or simply determining electricity wastage. In addition to internal initiatives, the
Company is active in supporting Municipal, State, and Federal initiatives that decrease overall
exposure to climate-related risks.

Regarding short-term climate related risks and opportunities, the Company previously undertook
the task of replacing older and less efficient light fixtures and bulbs. This simple project started

in August 2022, and has made an impact in reducing electricity consumption. The goal was
deemed successful in 2023, as Company directors determined that most electronic processing
equipment, and light fixtures had been updated to energy efficient substitutes.

The medium-term climate-related goals of the Company included the continued elimination of
internal paper-related communications, forms, records, and reports. As an insurance company,
the Company is required to maintain sufficient historical documentation of policy records,
policyholder communications, and other confidential information. The Company's
implementation of secure cloud-based servers, and electronically scanned recordkeeping has
drastically decreased the consumption of paper and other office supplies. By reducing the
consumption of office supplies and paper, the Company is creating a more accessible, efficient,
and ‘paperless’ system that also decreases environmental impact.

With the completion of the previous short-term climate-related goal, this goal was promoted to
the Company’s short-term goal for 2024. During fiscal year 2023, some progress was made on
this goal as the expenses for general office supplies, including paper, decreased marginally. The
‘Company will continue to use office supply expenses to quantify the success of this goal in 2024.
Long-term goals included implementation of an E-waste procedure, and renewal energy
provision in the Company’s investment policy. Progress has been made towards these goals as
the Company is now actively drafting an E-waste procedure and is investigating possible routes
of investment into the renewable energy economy. The goal to invest in renewable energy
holdings has been moved to a medium-term goal.

Insurance companies regularly hold large portfolios of bonds and other fixed income invested
assets which are guided by the investment policy. The new medium-term goal would include an
amendment to the Company’s investment policy to make provision for the holding of at least one
renewable energy investment. The completion of the goal will be determined upon the purchase
of the renewable energy holding.

E-waste components are subject to be reutilized for the care and repair of current electronic
processing equipment. The Company is currently working to secure an E-waste recycling
vendor that can responsibly dispose of aged electronic processing equipment. In addition, it is the
‘Company’s policy that obsolete electronic processing equipment is carefully disposed of after the
Company’s Information Technology team reviews the equipment for salvageable or reusable
parts.

The resilience of these strategies remains to be stable in the Company’s current circumstances.
However, the strategy is vulnerable to some climate-related risks. For example, intense cases of
inclement weather could cause a necessity for additional paper-based notifications to be sent to
policyholders. Also, there remain regulatory and practical barriers to eliminating the use of
paper, as seen in the Company’s new short-term goals. Furthermore, inopportune market
conditions make the Board hesitant to delegate large investments in renewable energy. The
Company will continue to monitor these trends and conditions as they look to fulfilling these
goals.

Risk Management

The Company’s climate-exposed risk is managed by the COO in collaboration with financial
compliance and actuarial professionals. Mortality data, regarding cause of death, is reviewed
annually to assess the risks pertaining to the underwriting of life insurance policies. The
Company primarily markets to elderly individuals in need of final expense life insurance.
Climate related risks for this demographic are nominal, considering their lifestyle choices:
however, the Company monitors existing risks, and acknowledges instances where such climate
risks could result in fatality. Underwriting risks relating to climate are addressed through the
insurer’s general enterprise-risk management process. In addition, the Companys market
compliance team is responsible for the research and development of plans and policy forms that
could utilize climate-related opportunities.

The Company primarily markets to elderly individuals in need of final expense life insurance.
Climate related risks for this demographic are nominal, considering their lifestyle choices:
however, the Company monitors existing risks, and acknowledges where such climate risks
could result in fatality.

Direct climate risk, as defined by the Company, are risks that could prohibit or hinder the
operations of the Company’s underwriting, claims, or insurance administration staff. Some
common direct climate related risks of the Company include hurricanes, tornados, tropical
thunderstorms, wildfires, and high temperatures. In these circumstances, the operational risk of
the Company is assessed by executive officers in association with department directors and
human resources staff. Decisions regarding these incidents are made with consideration of
financial cost, time-value cost, employee safety, structural integrity, and relevant criteria
referenced in the employee manual.

Regarding investments, the Company does not hold many specific climate-risk exposed
securities. Large-sale macroeconomic and microeconomic climate-related events could
potentially devalue invested assets; however, this is unlikely considering the nature of corporate
bonds and US Treasury securities. Factors such as volatility, current fixed income perspectives,
and asset class mix reports are used to monitor the condition of the Company’s portfolio on a
quarterly basis.

Metrics and Targets

There are limited metrics available to monitor the climate related risks associated with life
insurance companies. In addition, the implementation of complex systems and metrics would not
be cost effective, or marginally important considering the size of the Company’s carbon
footprint.

The Company designates how each climate related goal will be quantified, and completed, at the
time the respective goal is set. In addition, the Company regularly monitors water and electricity
usage through the utility invoices provided by the City of Thomasville.

Climate-related policies are consistently implemented with respect to the operational needs and
reporting capabilities of the Company. As the Company grows, efforts to monitor its related
climate effects, and risk will develop.

REDESIGNED STATE CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE SURVEY
INTENT AND PURPOSE
The Climate Risk Disclosure Survey is a voluntary risk management tool for state insurance
regulators to request from insurers on an annual basis a non-confidential disclosure of the
insurers’ assessment and management of their climate-related risks.
The purpose of the Climate Risk Disclosure Survey is to:
* Enhance transparency about how insurers manage climate-related risks and
opportunities.
‘* Identify good practices and vulnerabilities.
* Provide a baseline supervisory tool to assess how climate-related risks may affect the
insurance industry.
* Promote insurer strategic management and encourage shared learning for continual
improvement.
+ Enable better-informed collaboration and engagement on climate-related issues among
regulators and interested parties.
* Align with international climate risk disclosure frameworks to reduce redundancy in
reporting requirements.
BACKGROUND
The NAIC adopted the original Climate Risk Disclosure Survey in 2010 and it has since been
administered by the California Department of Insurance. In 2021, fifteen states participated in
the climate risk disclosure survey initiative, up from six states in prior years. Because any
insurer writing business in a participating state is required to submit their survey response
annually, adding nine states in 2021, increased the market coverage from approximately 70% in
2020 to nearly 80% of the market in 2021 based on direct premium written.
In 2021, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) produced a series of recommendations
for financial regulators to enhance supervision, data analysis, staff resources, and regulatory
cooperation related to climate risk. This included a recommendation to consider enhancing
public reporting requirements for climate-related risks in a manner that builds on the four core
elements of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), to the extent
consistent with the U.S. regulatory framework and the needs of U.S. regulators and market
participants.
This revised survey responds to FSOC’s recommendations and incorporates international best
practices in adopting a TCFD aligned framework for US insurers to report on climate risks when
requested by their state regulator.
The TCFD framework is structured around four thematic areas that are core elements

Adopted by the Climate Risk Disclosure Workstream March 11, 2022
Adopted by the Climate and Resiliency (EX) Task Force March 21, 2022
Adopted by the Executive (EX) Committee April 6, 2022
for how insurers operate—governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.
The four thematic areas are supported by key climate-related financial disclosures—referred to
as recommended disclosures—that build out the framework with information that will help
regulators and others understand how reporting organizations assess and approach climate-
related issues.
INTRODUCTORY GUIDANCE
Timeline and expectation for reporting
We expect that every company who will be asked to complete the survey in 2022 will have already
completed the existing NAIC survey or filed a TCFD report; nearly all companies having participated for
several prior years. The table below outlines the timing and other expectations for reporting in 2022 and
2023 as the new survey is phased in. If a company has not previously responded to the NAIC survey, it
should be given until 2023 to first respond.

on an annual basis. As of 2021, the following states/territories participate: California,
Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington.
Confidentiality and best effort basis
While the existing NAIC survey and TCFD contain sufficient overlap in the analysis required to
answer, we recognize that many insurers will be moving to a new reporting framework in the
TCFD. Insurers should make their best effort to answer each question honestly and completely,
keeping in mind that the information contained in the filing will be made public. During the
transition to the TCFD aligned survey, state insurance regulators should work closely with
insurers to provide as much flexibility as possible in terms of responding to the survey and
deadlines. Confidential information should not be included in this public disclosure unless it is
intended to be made public. if additional detail is requested by a state insurance regulator, that
request will be handled directly between the regulator and insurer.
Materiality
There is no requirement to provide information that is immaterial to an assessment of financial
soundness (insurers may choose to disclose such information voluntarily, with no implication
that such information is in fact material). Insurers should justify their materiality
assessment. For the definition of materiality, refer to the Financial Condition Examiners
Handbook and/or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Accounting Bulletin: No. 99, if
applicable.
Consistent with TCFD guidance, the Strategy and Metrics and Targets Sections involve an
assessment of materiality, except for the question on Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas
emissions within the Metrics and Targets Section. Disclosures related to Governance and Risk
Management Sections do not involve an assessment of materiality.
Assessing financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities
The financial impacts of climate-related issues on an insurer are driven by the specific climate-
related risks and opportunities to which the insurer is exposed and its strategic and risk
management decisions on seizing those opportunities and managing those risks (i.e., accept,
avoid, pursue, reduce, or share/transfer). Once an insurer assesses its climate-related issues
and determines its response to those issues, it can then consider actual and potential financial
impacts on revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities, and capital and financing.?
Consistent with the TCFD Guidelines, determining whether an individual organization is or may
be affected financially by climate-related issues usually depends on:
‘* the organization's exposure to, and anticipated effects of, specific climate-related risks
and opportunities;

‘© the organization’s planned responses to manage (i.e., accept, avoid, pursue, reduce, or
share/transfer) its risks or seize opportunities; and
‘© the implications of the organization's planned responses on its income statement, cash
flow statement, and balance sheet.?
Importantly, an organization should assess its climate-related risks and opportunities within the
context of its businesses, operations, and physical locations in order to determine potential
financial implications. In making such an assessment, an organization should consider (1)
current and anticipated policy constraints and incentives in relevant jurisdictions, technology
changes and availability, and market changes and (2) whether an organization's physical
locations or suppliers are particularly vulnerable to physical impacts from climate change.
See pages 10-12 of the TCFD's Implementation Recommendation Report for more guidance on
assessing exposure, response and implications.
ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC GUIDANCE
One of the several benefits of aligning with the TCFD is that it allows insurers to benefit from
years of guidance and supporting material developed and being regularly updated by the TCFD
and other organizations.
For those insurers new to TCFD reporting, the Implementation Recommendation Report
provides a useful guide. It contains guidance for all sectors on each of the four thematic areas
of governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. For example, in relation to
the risk management disclosure to describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing
climate-related risks, it provides the following guidance:
Organizations should describe their risk management processes for identifying
and assessing climate-related risks. An important aspect of this description is
how organizations determine the relative significance of climate-related risks in
relation to other risks.
Organizations should describe whether they consider existing and emerging
regulatory requirements related to climate change (e.g., limits on emissions) as
well as other relevant factors considered.
Organizations should also consider disclosing the following:

related risks and

The same document also provides supplemental insurance-sector specific guidance. For
example, for the same disclosure question, it provides:
Insurance companies should describe the processes for identifying and assessing
climate-related risks on re-/insurance portfolios by geography, business division,
or product segments, including the following risks:
- physical risks from changing frequencies and intensities of weather-related
perils;
~ transition risks resulting from a reduction in insurable interest due to a
decline in value, changing energy costs, or implementation of carbon
regulation; and
~ liability risks that could intensify due to a possible increase in litigation >
Notably, this general and supplemental guidance is not required to be included in a TCFD report.
Rather, it is designed to support an insurer in developing climate-related financial disclosures
consistent with the TCFD framework, including by providing context and suggestions for
implementing the recommended disclosures.
The disclosures identified in bullet points in this survey are intended to be supplemental,
insurance-sector specific guidance. They have been developed by the NAIC to respond to the
TCFD and FSOC recommendations that regulators enhance public reporting requirements for
climate-related risks in a manner that builds on the TCFD’s four core elements. They are
designed to further support insurers’ in developing their disclosures by providing context and
suggestions for the information a regulator may expect.
Additional guidance published by the TCFD includes:
The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities (2017)
provides information on types of climate-related scenarios, the application of scenario analysis,
and the key challenges in implementing scenario analysis to support an organization’s
disclosure of the resilience of its strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios.

identified any material climate-related risks that would impact our ability to achieve our three-year
strategic plan.
The Company has not identified material risks related to our investments as we maintain a
diversified portfolio to minimize risk of any type, including exposure to climate-related risks.
Molina’s revenues are derived primarily through premiums received from providing health plan
coverage to individuals through government subsidized programs. The premiums we receive for
our three major lines of business—Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace—are based on rates that
are developed and approved for actuarial soundness on an annual basis. Therefore, we have the
ability to capture changes in medical costs that may be due to environmental factors.
Short, Medium, and Long Term Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities
Risk ~ Physical risks
As ahealth care company operating in over twenty states and serving more than five million
members, the communities Molina serves will continue to be directly and indirectly affected by
climate-related issues. Among other risks, environmental factors, such as a major earthquake or
wildfire in California, or a major hurricane affecting Florida, South Carolina or Texas, may cause
widespread illness or medical conditions, or a disruption in members’ services, each of which may
result in increased health care costs.

Opportunity ~ Resource Efficiency
Molina’s direct environmental impacts result primarily from the electricity, heating and cooling
systems in its office space and the impact of workday commuting by its employees. Remote work
is now an essential element of Molina’s workplace modernization strategy. Molina adopted a
permanent remote work model for nearly all employees. To support this new model, Molina
reduced its real estate footprint by more than two thirds. Molina’s remaining office space has been
reconfigured and optimized for utilization and efficiency and workday commuting by Molina’s
employees has been almost eliminated. This significantly reduced Molina’s carbon footprint.

Response:

Process for Identifying and Assessing Climate-Related Risks

The Company’s ERM function utilizes the three lines of defense model to ensure responsibility for

risk management resides within business functions, operational areas, and with senior management.

Molina’s risk management framework is in place to identify, assess, monitor, and respond to all risks,

including climate-related risks, that could negatively impact achievement of our strategic priorities,

operational business objectives or our stakeholders.

The Company’s ERM function evaluates all risks identified via an annual risk assessment process

using its risk priority ranking scales (likelihood and impact), which includes an estimate of potential

financial impact.

The Company’s Business Continuity function maintains daily identification and oversight of any

Company-level risks related to climate change that may impact Molina’s members, employees, and

physical assets.

The Company has not identified material risks related to our investments as we maintain a diversified

portfolio to minimize risk of any type, including exposure to climate-related risks. The Company does

plan to work with our investment managers to further consider these risks.

Process for Managing Climate-Related Risks

To manage the physical risks of climate change, Molina maintains a central threat intelligence,

incident monitoring, and emergency response center consisting of trained intelligence analysts and

crisis coordinators on a 24/7/365 basis. This team proactively monitors situations such as natural

disasters and other climate-related emergencies that could impact Molina’s assets, operations, or

members. Upon notice of an impending situation, detailed intelligence reports are generated and sent

to decision makers within the Company so that they may initiate a coordinated crisis or incident

response.

Through knowledge generated by a business impact analysis, the crisis and incident response team is

able to determine which assets and work practices may be at risk and initiate action plans to help

Molina prepare for or manage the incident with minimal impact to its operations and members. This

RESPONSES
Response to 1
Sentruity Casualty Company's (“Sentruity”) governance around climate-related risks and opportunities is
based on the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERM), whose activities related to such risks are
discussed in the response to item 1.A below. Although Sentruity has not articulated publicly-stated
goals on climate-related risks or opportunities, the process for identifying such risks does not preclude
future publicly-stated goals. Any climate-related disclosures (currently there are none) would be
addressed through the ERM and Sentruity’s management. Please also see the response to item 4 for
more information.
Response to L.A
‘The Sentruity ERM assesses the company’s inherent and residual risks. The ERM is responsible for the
leadership, innovation, governance, and management necessary to identify, evaluate, mitigate, and
manage the operational and strategic risk. As part of identifying the risks to Sentruity, it has considered
climate risk, specifically within the risks associated with Underwriting and Operations. Furthermore, the
ERM, in conjunction with Sentruity’s Business Continuity Planning working group, monitors and has
developed plans to address the loss of material resources, including those related to climate-driven
events and the company’s mitigation responses tied to those events. Sentruity bases its investment risk
management decisions on market data and trends, and in consultation with its qualified investment
advisors.

Response to 1.B
Management assesses natural catastrophe (CAT) risk as part of the annual ERM process. Sentruity is
exposed to potential aggregate losses from CAT such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires on the
guaranteed automobile protection (GAP) business. A significant portion of the business is reinsured
through producer-owned reinsurance companies, which reduces the exposure to such events. In
addition, Sentruity purchases per occurrence GAP XOL (Excess of Loss) for CAT events. The overall CAT
risk is managed by the Underwriting and Risk team.
Strategy

Response to 3
Management assesses CAT risk as part of the annual ERM process. Sentruity is exposed to losses from
climate-related risks for its GAP business. The company is exposed to potential aggregate losses CAT
such as hurricanes, flooding, ice storms and earthquakes. Management monitors these risks as part of
its pricing process which is driven by underwriting results which consider historical climate-related
events.

While Sentruity does not model the climate risks associated with the GAP business, it uses Guy

Carpenter's assessment which proactively assesses the impact of any catastrophic events. The results of

the assessment, if appropriate, are recorded in the Financial Statement consistent with Statutory

Accounting Standards. Furthermore, historical impacts of climate-related events are considered when

performing the budget setting process at a consolidated level. Additionally, Sentruity engages outside

actuaries in assessing loss patterns and these are used in the development of earnings curves, which
considers the risks and associated losses incurred related to climate change.

Introduction
Sentry Insurance Group takes a long-term perspective when making decisions, focusing on growing the
value of our organization while managing risk to best service our customers and associates. We strongly
believe in the benefits of diversification in our varied underwriting and investment portfolios as we strive
to provide a variety of products and services to individuals and businesses. This diversification, combined
with our risk management philosophy and strong capital position, equips Sentry to endure both short-
and long-term risks.
Global climate change has presented, and will continue to present, significant risks and opportunities to
the global economy including insurance companies. We recognize the importance of assessing these risks
and identify the opportunities that climate change presents for on our business strategy and operations.
Below, Sentry submits our NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey in alignment with the reporting
framework set by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD) for the calendar year 2023.

Introduction
Sentry Insurance Group takes a long-term perspective when making decisions, focusing on growing the
value of our organization while managing risk to best service our customers and associates. We strongly
believe in the benefits of diversification in our varied underwriting and investment portfolios as we strive
to provide a variety of products and services to individuals and businesses. This diversification, combined
with our risk management philosophy and strong capital position, equips Sentry to endure both short-
and long-term risks.
Global climate change has presented, and will continue to present, significant risks and opportunities to
the global economy including insurance companies. We recognize the importance of assessing these risks
and identify the opportunities that climate change presents for on our business strategy and operations.

Introduction
Sentry Insurance Group takes a long-term perspective when making decisions, focusing on growing the
value of our organization while managing risk to best service our customers and associates. We strongly
believe in the benefits of diversification in our varied underwriting and investment portfolios as we strive
to provide a variety of products and services to individuals and businesses. This diversification, combined
with our risk management philosophy and strong capital position, equips Sentry to endure both short-
and long-term risks.
Global climate change has presented, and will continue to present, significant risks and opportunities to
the global economy including insurance companies. We recognize the importance of assessing these risks
and identify the opportunities that climate change presents for on our business strategy and operations.
Below, Sentry submits our NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey in alignment with the reporting
framework set by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD) for the calendar year 2023.

the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on our
business and strategy.
Sentry understands the importance of incorporating climate change risk
management into our broader risk management strategy and integrating climate-
related factors into the core of our business practices. In collaboration with senior-
level management, including those overseeing underwriting, actuary, product,
investments, and more, we identified climate related risks and opportunities across
‘our enterprise. We have considered these risks and opportunities in the short,
medium, and long terms as shown below. These examples should not be construed as
characterization regarding the materiality or financial impact of these opportunities
or considered an exhaustive list of climate-related risks.

In 2023, the Company formed a dedicated ESG Forum (‘the Forum’) to reflect the Company's broader
focus on ESG policies, processes and disclosures, with a direct reporting line to the Executive Committee
and Board of Directors. The Climate Council, a subcommittee of the Forum, is designed to review and
manage climate-related risks and opportunities throughout the business and associated with strategy,
financial planning, underwriting and investment decisions and product development. The cross-functional
membership of the Forum and Climate Council helps embed ESG goals, objectives, and initiatives into the
strategy and operations of the Company. The members of the Forum and Climate Council represent a
myriad of business functions, including Actuarial, Risk, DEI&B, Human Resources, AmTrust International,
Governance and Regulatory Counsel, Legal Counsel, Investments, Operations, Commercial P&C,
Specialty Risk, Compliance, Treasury, Underwriting, Real Estate, and Exposure Management.
At the March 2024 meeting of the Company's Board of Directors, the Chief People & Communications
Officer (""CP&CO"") reporting on the significant development of the Company's first annual sustainability
report (""Business & Sustainability Review"") and then shared the report with the Company's Board of
Directors several weeks later. The Company is also working with a third-party to track baseline Scope 1
and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is developing metrics to establish a benchmark for the
‘Company.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Company's Enterprise Risk Management (""ERM"") function is responsible for monitoring climate-related
risks that impact the Company's insurance business. The Company's Global CRO provides the Company's
Audit Committee with an ERM report each quarter, a portion of which is dedicated to climate risks. A climate
change financial stress is considered in AmTrust's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) summary
reports annually.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment as it relates to natural catastrophe risks is in place
and embedded in ERM. The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee, which identifies new and
changing risks to the business.
Within the quarterly ERM report, risks are identified by category (e.g., financial, operational, strategic,
external and insurance) and sub-category (market, credit, liquidity, etc.) At the business unit level, the risk
management process consists of, but is not limited to, stakeholder discussions with key executives and risk
‘owners, examinations of risk state by risk category, reviews of design and control effectiveness test results,
where deemed necessary. AmTrust’s ERM team members continue to gain skills and knowledge for
assessing and managing climate risks by attending training events, industry events and other forums. The
ERM team uses data from the scientific community and resources provided by the TCFD guidance to advise
the ERM team and keep up to date of potential consequences or opportunities of climate-related impacts.
Two Board members, one of whom is responsible for the oversight of the Company's management of
climate risks, are members of the Company's management Risk Committee and attend the Company's
Audit Committee meetings. The Audit Committee, supported by Intemal Audit, provides independent
assurance on the design and effectiveness of the overall system of intemal control, including risk
management and compliance. Internal Audit is independent of both the business and the ERM function

A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
‘medium, and long term.
‘AmTrust is a commercial property and casualty insurance group that focuses on small businesses. The
‘Company provides workers’ compensation coverage and other commercial coverages for small and
medium-sized businesses. The businesses AmTrust insures include restaurants, retail stores, small
artisan contractors and medical and professional offices. The Company also provides coverage to
apartment buildings, condominiums, and hotels. Even though AmTrust is the third largest workers’
‘compensation insurer in the U.S., 96% of its workers’ compensation policies have annual premiums that
are less than $25,000. The Company's other commercial property and casualty lines also target smaller
businesses.
‘AmTrust also is one of the leading warranty insurers in the U.S. The Company provides the insurance
backstop for auto warranties issued by manufacturers and other warranty providers. The Company also
insures warranties on consumer products offered by many leading brands. These products protect tens
of thousands of consumers. The Company does not insure big businesses or high hazard industries.
The Company has identified five core climate-related risk categories by leveraging guidance provided by
independent experts, regulators and the Company's own assessment of which categories are most likely
to elicit a better understanding of the financial risks facing the Company. Within each core risk category,
material risk factors were identified over various time horizons.
Five core climate-related risk categories identified are as follows:
1. Physical Risks
‘+ Description: immediate risks arising from weather-related events and slow onset climate
changes

the various lines of business
1. Short- to long-term: severe storms (Property) and other weather events
(Warranty)
2. Long-term: increasing sea level (Property)
ji, Short- to long-term: extreme weather events may disrupt business continuity by
negatively impacting AmTrust carriers’ infrastructure and systems
2. Investment Risks
‘+ Description: risks arising from the exposure to market value deterioration of investments
driven by a current or expected impact of behavior relating to climate change
+ Examples:

i. Short-term: material and unforeseen drop in the value of an investment
holdings resulting from the perception that the issuer will be negatively
impacted by climate change related events or market activity

ji, Long-term: loss of market confidence in issuer to adapt business model to
address climate change related events or market demands

3. Transition Risks

v. Short. to medium-term: Talent management — difficulty attracting and retaining
employees due to the Company's negative impact on climate.

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business,

strategy, and financial planning.

‘Two specific areas are being prioritized as they present more risk to AmTrust based on its current strategic

and financial position.

1. Property Insurance: While each line of business AmTrust underwrites is vulnerable to various risk
factors arising from the changing climate, Property insurance is currently seen as the most likely to
experience negative impacts as a result of rising sea levels or changing weather patterns. As described
below in Section C, AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such
as hurricanes, storm surge, inland flooding or wildfires. AmTrust manages its exposure to adverse
weather risks through disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control and
risk transfer. AmTrust's property segment is a small part of its insured portfolio overall
Climate-related losses have not been a material threat to the Company's solvency. AmTrust has a
relatively low exposure to severe weather and catastrophe-type insurance events. AmTrust's insurance
contracts renew annually, which would enable a quick response to changes, as needed, by adjusting
pricing or by restricting exposure.

2. Investment Value Deterioration: AmTrust maintains conservative and diversified investment portfolios

but the market impacts of climate change to companies in which AmTrust invests is difficult to anticipate
and could lead to deteriorations in the valuation of related investment holdings.
The Company has analyzed its investment portfolio to determine what its concentration in fossil fuels
and other carbon-related holdings. The Company's fossil fuel investments comprise less than 10% of
its overall investment portfolio, which is mainly comprised of readily marketable invest ment-grade fixed-
income securities with relatively short duration. As such, climate change risk on the Company's
investment portfolio is currently low due to any impact taking place over a longer time horizon than the
average duration of the portfolio. The Company's corporate bond portfolio is well diversified by sector
and issuer and the impact of climate change, if any, on the creditworthiness of any issuer is insignificant
in the context of the whole portfolio. The Company believes climate risk is tempered by a relatively
short duration portfolio comprised of diverse issuers, which allows the Company to react and reposition
quickly to emerging climate risks.

The Company has taken steps to engage its key constituencies, including policyholders, agents and other

partnerships, on the topic of climate risk and resiliency.

ee! =:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
AmTrust proactively encourages its policyholders to reduce the potential losses caused by climate
influenced events through methods such as:

‘+ Utilization of AmTrust’s highly knowledgeable producer base to provide policyholder education
and guidance on purchasing appropriate coverages needed to mitigate specific risk exposures.

‘+ Policyholder notifications providing loss mitigation strategies and notices for ascertaining
coverage for certain catastrophic coverage through other Federal programs, such as flood
insurance.

+ AmTrust provides online news releases, videos and links to important resources, e.g.
disastersafety.org and Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety...all aimed at proactively
educating and training its customers on potential risk hazards and exposures along with mitigation
analysis, tips and solutions for flood, wind, winter weather, including top convective events

‘+ AmTrust provides Loss Control services that identify various exposures to its policyholders’
property and their ability to produce income that include means of mitigating weather related
losses induced by climate change.

In addition, the Company has ongoing partnerships to support its commitment to appropriately managing
environmental risks.

‘+ Partnered with a third-party to create industry first electric VSC (vehicle service contract) covering
batteries, and have partnered with various other administrators to expand AmTrust's green
footprint.

‘+ Developed and launched service contract program for electric vehicle residential charging station.

‘+ Ongoing research for whole home green infrastructure offerings to bundle coverage for electric
vehicles, at-home charging stations, solar panels, and electricity storage units.

+ AmTrust Title's energy division is dedicated to supporting the growth of clean energy initiatives by
partnering with developers, investors, and lending partners to navigate the unique challenges of
energy project goals. AmTrust's range of energy projects includes wind and solar farms, battery
storage, hydroelectric, hydrogen, liquid nitrogen gas, renewable natural gas, and transmission
lines.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-
related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

Property Insurance -

As the potential for property damage increases because of the changing climate, itis critical to maintain a
strong understanding of the myriad of factors that impact the assessment of properties within AmTrust's
portfolio. The mitigants, as outlined below, explain further the Company's steps to reduce the negative
effects of major catastrophic events.

Mitigants:

‘+ AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such as hurricanes,
storm surge, inland flooding or wildfires. The Company manages its exposure to adverse weather
risks through disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control, and risk
transfer.

‘+ AmTrust considers extreme weather events in pricing and underwriting its insurance products. To
determine the premium associated with the costs of these extreme events the Company relies on
historical storm data, as well as utilizing catastrophe models to supplement this historical data due
to the infrequent nature of extreme weather events

+ ERM’s Exposure Management Team has been regularly performing detailed analysis over the
property and workers’ compensation insurance portfolios for AmTrust as a whole. On a quarterly
basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models.
Hurricane modelled results are based on warm sea surface temperatures catalogues, which
recognize the near/medium term view on sea-surface temperatures, thereby capturing recent
trends. AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year
catastrophe probable maximum loss (""PML"") be protected by reinsurance purchases for property.

ee! =:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
The modelled 1:250-year catastrophe PML for property and workers’ compensation are monitored
against approved risk appetites. In addition, the Company runs Lloyd's Realistic Disaster
‘Scenarios to estimate the potential losses incurred from a variety of hypothetical disaster scenarios,
using consistent and appropriate methods and assumptions.

‘+ AmTrust’s property insurance portfolio is protected by AmTrust's property catastrophe excess of
loss treaty attaching at $70m.

‘+ Climate change financial stress is considered in the Company's ORSA report. The hurricane
exceedance probability curve was adjusted to reflect climate change by increasing the frequency
of hurricane Category 3 events by 15%, Category 4 events by 25%, Category 5 events by 35%,
and increasing storm surge ground up losses by 35%. The post-stress Universal Best's Capital
‘Adequacy Ratio (""BCAR’) is used to assess capital adequacy on a group level. The group's capital
risk appetite is to maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99"" percentile, which
results in a BCAR assessment of “Adequate”. The resulting net loss as measured by the 1:200-
year PML did not have a significant effect on the Company's capital due to the limit of catastrophe
reinsurance purchased.

‘+ No attempt has been made at this time to identify and measure a climate scenario equivalent to
two-degrees of Celsius.

‘+ The Exposure Management function within ERM works closely with the underwriting, actuarial
pricing and ceded reinsurance teams to inform of the adequacy of AmTrust's reinsurance
purchasing as compared to the risk appetites

‘+ The Company's insurance contracts are renewable annually, which would enable the Company to
quickly respond to changes as needed by adjusting its pricing or by restricting its exposure.

‘+ AmTrust’s preference for small risks provides a natural diversification against climate change
catastrophe due to the spread of the risks within and between geographic regions.

‘+ AmTrust manages its coastal wind exposures based on state-specific eligibility criteria reflecting
the building's distance to the coast, construction, as well as the age and condition of the roof.
Underwriting actions have reduced coastal exposures in Florida and along the Gulf Coast to further
mitigate large hurricane events.

‘+ To mitigate its exposure to extreme weather events in hail-prone areas, AmTrust maintains
eligibility requirements on an assessment of the insured vulnerability to damaging hail hazard, plus
the building's characteristics, such as a building's roof area, covering materials, and equipment e.g
HVAC or solar panels,

‘+ Corrective pricing and underwriting measures in Property Northeast have limited exposure growth
to reduce property catastrophe aggregation risk.

Investment Valuations -

The value of the types of financial instruments in which the Company is invested could be significantly
impacted if the market develops a perception that the issuer is either not adequately managing its climate
change risk or is accumulating a competitive disadvantage by not adapting its business strategy.

Mitigants:

‘+ AmTrust has analyzed its investment portfolio to determine the concentration of fossil fuel
investments, as well as other carbon related investments. The Company's fossil fuel investments
comprise less than 10% of its overall group-wide investment portfolio

‘+ The investment portfolio consists of readily marketable investment-grade fixed-income securities
with relatively short duration. As such, climate change risk on the Company's investment portfolio
is currently low due to any impact taking place over a longer time horizon than the average duration
of the portfolio. The Company's corporate bond portfolio is well diversified by sector and issuer and

In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the
following:
+ Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's general enterprise-

The potential impact to AmTrust’s underwriting portfolio from the increased physical risk potential due to
climate fluctuations are as follows:

‘+ In Coastal areas along the U.S. Eastem coast and Gulf Coast, the potential of climate
fluctuations has a higher hurricane, tropical, extra tropical or noreaster storm event frequency
and severity, which could increase policyholder losses for personal and commercial property
and commercial auto coverages.

‘+ InNon-coastal areas, the potential risk of climate fluctuations is increased convective storm
events or severe weather (winds/derecho/straight-line, hail, flood, tornado, lightning, single day
adverse precipitation event, etc.) causing frequency and severity, which could increase losses
for personal and commercial property and commercial auto coverages. This could result in
higher policyholder losses in any area within the United States, but is at an increased level in

ey! 12

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
states where AmTrust currently has exposure, such as Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Louisiana.

‘+ Apotential risk of climate fluctuations is an increased frequency and severity of wildfire events,
which could increase policyholder losses for commercial property and auto coverages.

‘+ A potential risk of climate fluctuations is increased groundwater withdrawal and drought leading
to land subsidence issues, both inland and coastal, which could increase losses for commercial
property coverages in the lower Midwest and Southeastern states.

+ Reinsurance could become more expensive and scarce if climate induced events become more
frequent and severe.

‘+ AmTrust utilizes industry specific CAT predictive modelling, concentration monitoring tools and
risk management solutions to manage its exposure to climate fluctuations and impacts including
adjusting its guidelines and reinsurance retentions accordingly.

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment is in place and embedded in the ERM process.
The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee comprised of the Group CRO, International CRO, US
Head of Risk and other members of the ERM function. This committee, through the engagement of
management and other research, identifies new and changing risks to the business, tracks their
development and assesses the risk they pose to the Company. These risks are highlighted in the quarterly
ERM report and shared with the Risk Committee.
ERM's Exposure Management Team regularly performs detailed analysis of the property and workers’
‘compensation insurance portfolios. On a quarterly basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures
are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models, with separate modeling for the perils of hurricane, convective
storm, winter storm and wildfire. Hurricane modelled results are based on the warm sea surface
temperature catalogue, which recognize the near/medium term view on sea temperatures and capture the
increased frequency and severity of hurricanes experienced in these warmer periods.
B. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks.
AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, storm
surge, inland flooding or wildfires. The Company manages its exposure to adverse weather risks through
disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control, and risk transfer. AmTrust
considers extreme weather events in pricing and underwriting its insurance products. To determine the
premium associated with the costs of these extreme events AmTrust relies on historical storm data, as well
as utilizing catastrophe models to supplement this historical data due to the infrequent nature of extreme
weather events
AmTrust manages its coastal wind exposures based on state-specific eligibility criteria reflecting the
building's distance to the coast, construction, as well as the age and condition of the roof. To mitigate its
exposure to extreme weather events in hail-prone areas, the Company maintains eligibility requirements
on an assessment of the insured vulnerability to damaging hail hazard, plus the building's characteristics,
such as a building's roof area, covering materials, and equipment e.g. HVAC or solar panels. AmTrust
utilizes catastrophe models to manage its portfolio's probable maximum losses to these types of extreme
events.
AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year catastrophe PML
be protected by reinsurance purchases for property and workers’ compensation, respectively. The
modelled 1:250-year catastrophe PML for property and workers’ compensation are monitored against
approved risk appetites. In addition, the Company runs Lloyd's Realistic Disaster Scenarios to estimate the
potential losses incurred from a variety of hypothetical disaster scenarios, using consistent and appropriate
methods and assumptions, which allow for the recognition of exposure changes in various geographic areas.
Climate change financial stress is considered annually in the Company's ORSA report. The hurricane

maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99"" percentile which results in a BCAR
assessment of “Adequate”. The 1:200-year PML with the aforementioned adjustments for climate change
did not result in a significant stress to the Company's capital due to the level of reinsurance coverage in
place
The Exposure Management Team works closely with the underwriting, actuarial pricing and ceded
reinsurance teams to inform AmTrust's reinsurance purchasing.
Management of climate-related risks is incorporated into the Company's risk function. The Company is
conducting a core risk assessment and developing a Climate Change Financial Risk Framework (‘the
Framework""). The Framework will be used to monitor exposure to climate change and how it could impact
the resilience of the Company's financial and physical operations.
The Company will consider including additional stress scenarios that simulate potential impacts relating to
climate risks into its ORSA process. Additionally, the Company uses data from the scientific community
and resources provided by the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures to advise its risk
team and keep up to date of potential consequences or opportunities of climate-related impacts that it
incorporates into its risk assessment. This will support strategic decision making by providing
management and the board with a deeper understanding of the impact of a given climate scenario on its
chosen business model and strategy. This is an important step to embed the Framework into the
Company's strategy, governance, and decision-making process.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment is in place and embedded in the general ERM
process. The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee, which identifies new and changing risks to the

A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in

line with its strategy and risk management process.

The Company maintains catastrophe risk appetites that are currently defined based on the modelled 1:250-

year catastrophe PMLs (per occurrence). Management monitors that these loss events are protected by

adequate reinsurance structures. Exposure to these events is regularly simulated for the property and

workers’ compensation portfolios. AFSI compares the reinsurance limits and the simulated PML from

realistic disaster scenarios, and also the net loss resulting from a 1:250 year hurricane event as a ratio to

surplus.

‘The Company has started to measure its 2023 Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (""GHG"") emissions

in 2024. Most of AmTrust's Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions come from office activity and company-

‘owned/controlled mobile combustion sources. The Company has not set any GHG emissions reduction

targets but plans on developing strategies to mitigate emissions.

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and

the related risks.

The Company is beginning to measure its baseline Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. AmTrust

Governance — narrative

1. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.

In disclosing the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities insurers should consider

including the following:

* Identify and include any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and opportunities.

* Describe where climate-related disclosure is handled within the insurer’s structure, e.g., at a group level, entity

level, or a combination. If handled at the group level, describe what activities are undertaken at the company

level.

A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.

* Describe the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the climate-

related financial risks.

‘© On April 9"" 2024, Protective Life Insurance Company, the principal subsidiary of Protective Life Corporation
(""Protective""), a U.S. subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc., entered into an agreement to acquire
ShelterPoint Group, Inc.

‘The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals and other
customary closing conditions. Until the closing, both businesses will maintain separate operations.

In light of this pending acquisition, ShelterPoint plans to coordinate any publicly stated goals on climate-related

risks and opportunities with Protective, following the close of transaction. That said, ShelterPoint takes pride in

the low carbon footprint of our business, which has been markedly reduced since the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
work-from-home policy is particularly climate friendly, where managers set time in the office as appropriate for
their specific area, subject to the modest overall requirement that employees should be in the office at least two
days per month; 25% of our employees typically visit our offices on any given day. With the help of an online
calculator available from the EPA, we estimate this post-pandemic reduction in commute miles travelled

eliminates over 330,000 kg of CO2 emissions per year, which is the approximate equivalent of maintaining a 390-

acre forest (per the EPA calculator).

Because insurance companies can have an outsized impact on climate relative to their headcount based on how

they invest their assets, we have invested a significant portion of our portfolio in an ESG money-market fund

(ESGXX), with a peak investment of over $180 million in second quarter 2024. Asa result of regulatory changes,

this and other ESG money market funds have recently been discontinued, and these amounts have been moved to

a more traditional government money market fund pending the close of transaction, at which time we would

consider future ESG investment opportunities in conjunction with Protective.

ShelterPoint business areas have implemented numerous workflow improvements to reduce our carbon footprint

while also providing benefit to policyholders. These initiatives encourage policyholders to access data, forms, and

other information electronically, reducing the need for physical distribution of paper-based materials. Some of
these initiatives include:

* Offering policyholders e-billing options, thereby reducing print and mail activities

* Electronic submission of claims, applications, and other benefit materials

+ Expanding use of E-delivery of forms, applications, certificates, booklets, etc.

* Continuing to email broker communications and ongoing broker utilization of E-application platforms

* Expanded use of social media to communicate with customers

+ Expanded use of mobile device applications for claims status

* Use of web conferencing to facilitate team and customer meetings to reduce travel requirements

* Encouraging employees to scan documents rather than copying them.

These initiatives are impactful because our approximately 250 employees work to insure over 197,000 businesses
and two million employees, working with over 7,000 brokers, so eliminating paper where possible is highly
consequential to our carbon footprint.

ShelterPoint handles climate-related disclosure at the company level for ShelterPoint Life Insurance Company,
which also encompasses its wholly-owned subsidiary, ShelterPoint Insurance Company.

ShelterPoint considers climate risk as an important part of its overall Enterprise Risk Management (""ERM"")
framework, which provides key risk reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors (""BOD""). Annually,
the BOD approves the enterprise risk policy that describes the risk appetite and tolerance levels set by senior
management of ShelterPoint. In addition, the ERM policy is filed with the New York Department of Financial
Services. The policy provides guidance to ensure risk exposures will remain within acceptable boundaries.

The Board Audit Committee is responsible for providing oversight of ShelterPoint’s climate-related financial risks
and opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy and risk appetite. The Board Audit Committee is
informed of potential climate-related issues as part of its general oversight of ShelterPoint’s enterprise risk
management. The Committee meets to discuss relevant risk issues, including climate risk, on a quarterly basis.

B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.

ShelterPoint has an ERM Function which includes the Chief Risk Officer, Director of Risk Management, and the
Executive Risk Owners. The ERM Function's responsibilities include assessing and managing ShelterPoint’s
enterprise risks, which include climate risk. Key risk information and updates are reported to executive

Strategy — narrative

2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s businesses,
strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.

In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's businesses,
strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and resiliency.
* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its operations or
organizations.

A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium, and long
term.

In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium, and
longer term, insurers should consider including the following:

* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-Syears as short term, 5-10years as medium term, and
10-30 years as long term.

In the context of this narrative, we define short, medium, and long-term horizons as 1-5 years, 5-10 years, and 10-
30 years respectively.

ShelterPoint has engaged multiple constituencies in ways that help to manage climate risk. As shared in our
response to question 1, we have engaged with our customers and brokers to significantly reduce the use of paper
and the carbon emitted by manufacturing and transporting it. We have engaged with our employees to encourage
working from home. We engage with senior management, our board members and shareholders regarding the
management of all our enterprise risks, climate among them. We have historically engaged with our investment
advisors to invest a substantial part of our assets in ESG funds. Finally, we engage our IT function and operational
managers in ensuring we have an appropriate Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity plan in place.

Our ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions are detailed in our response to question 1.

In the short term, ShelterPoint has identified acute weather events (e.g. snow storms, floods, hurricanes, etc.) as a
potential risk that can negatively impact ShelterPoint’s operations and policyholder service. ShelterPoint has
worked to mitigate this risk in multiple ways: The Company's offices in Garden City, New York are on the fourth
floor of an office building and therefore not subject to flooding. The Company's computer servers are kept at a
separate location in Lake Success, New York, where they draw electricity from a power grid especially reserved for
a nearby medical center. Further, the Lake Success building is serviced by a generator should there be a power
failure. Lastly, the Company maintains backup servers in Pennsylvania, creating geographic diversity for its IT
systems. The Company has also formulated a thorough Disaster Management Plan that spells out in precise detail
the procedures that employees must follow to ensure that critical business functions are restored as soon as
practicable following a disaster. IT staff members practice Disaster Management drills every two weeks to ensure
familiarity with the Plan. The Company hired an outside consultant in early 2023 to evaluate the plan and help the
management team conduct disaster-readiness tabletop exercises, which resulted in both very good overall scores
and ideas for further improvement

In the medium and long term, ShelterPoint does not believe there exist material physical or transition risks that
would impact its business. ShelterPoint's main lines of business are NY statutory short-term disability and NY Paid
Family Leave (NYDBL/NYPFL); we do not believe claim levels for these disability-type products are meaningfully
impacted by climate change. In any case, all of ShelterPoint's lines of business, subject to regulatory approval and
consistent with applicable statute, may be repriced annually as the underlying risk evolves, which would allow
ShelterPoint (or, for NYPFL, NYSDFS) to adjust rates for climate-related impacts as they evolve in the future.

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business, strategy, and financial
planning.

* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low carbon economy
or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.

* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon economy.

The nature of ShelterPoint’s business is primarily statutory short-term disability and paid family leave. As such, we
do not specifically provide products or services that support the transition to a low carbon economy or help
customers adapt to climate-related risk, but we serve an important role in providing financial protection when a
disability occurs, as well as important bonding time for new children with their mothers and fathers, and time to
care for a family member should they become seriously ill or disabled.

ShelterPoint does not expect material physical risks arising from climate change that would impact business
operations. ShelterPoint’s ERM Function will continue to monitor long term climate change effects on operations
and ensure the DR/BC Plan is adjusted accordingly.

Strategically, ShelterPoint aims to grow and expand its statutory and related employee benefits business in NY and
nationwide, and ShelterPoint does not believe climate-related risks will materially impact this market.

ShelterPoint’s third party asset managers take the issue of climate risk into consideration in the same manner as.
any other potential drivers of risk and return in the investment portfolio. ShelterPoint’s portfolio is highly-rated,
and these ratings encompass the potential for transition risk; in addition, the average duration of our bond
portfolio is approximately four years, significantly limiting transition risk. In addition, ShelterPoint has historically
invested a sizeable portion of its assets in a Money Market Fund which is focused on ESG investment opportunities
(please see our response to question 1).

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios,
including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

Given the nature of ShelterPoint's business, as discussed above, we do not expect material risks arising from
climate change that would impact our strategy.

Strategy - closed ended questions answered in addition to the narrative

Risk Management - narrative

3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks. In disclosing how the insurer
identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting portfolio, and how the
company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to physical, transition and liability risk.

* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential physical and
transition climate related risks, if applicable.

* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment portfolio, including
what investment classes have been considered.

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how frequently the process is
completed.

ShelterPoint identifies and assesses climate-related risks as part of its enterprise risk management activities,
which includes risk identification and risk quantification at an enterprise level. The risk quantification process
allows ShelterPoint to assess the financial implications of its risks that are determined to be material.
ShelterPoint's ERM Function plans to carry out and review the risk management processes on an annual basis.

B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.

All material risks are assigned an Executive Risk Owner, who is accountable for managing the identified risk by
developing and maintaining a risk mitigation strategy. ShelterPoint recognizes climate-related natural
catastrophes as a key risk and maintains a robust DR/BC Plan accordingly.

C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the
insurer’s overall risk management.

In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers should consider
including the following:

In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the
insurer’s overall risk management, insurers should consider including the following

* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-risk management
process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including which risk factors
the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are considered.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including which risk
factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are considered.
ShelterPoint maintains an enterprise-wide risk management approach that assesses a variety of threats, with
climate change being just one facet. ShelterPoint maintains a risk register that includes a qualitative assessment
on all identified risks, including climate risk and natural disaster risk. Furthermore, if a risk is deemed material
through the qualitative assessment, ShelterPoint confirms a risk mitigation strategy is in place and conducts a
quantitative assessment involving scenario analysis to understand the risk impact to ShelterPoint’s business and
market value.
ShelterPoint believes that its approach to risk assessment and mitigation has prepared ShelterPoint to meet
current climate change challenges. The impacts of climate change can vary greatly depending on geographic
location and environmental conditions, posing a threat to businesses and individuals alike. As ShelterPoint’s
Business Continuity Plan has been carefully considered with input from numerous business unit leaders,
ShelterPoint’s confidence level in the continuity of business operations and ability to keep the data centers
operational remains high.
We recognize that climate change is a complex and evolving risk. Our ERM framework continues to monitor and
assess the financial impact of climate-related risks.
ShelterPoint's main lines of business are NY statutory short-term disability and NY Paid Family Leave
(NYDBL/NYPFL); we do not believe claim levels for these disability-type products are meaningfully impacted by
climate change. In any case, all of ShelterPoint's lines of business, subject to regulatory approval and applicable
statute, may be repriced annually as the underlying risk evolves, which would allow ShelterPoint (or, for NYPFL,
NYSDFS) to adjust rates for climate-related impacts as they evolve in the future.
ShelterPoint’s investments are managed by a third-party asset manager which utilizes a proprietary climate rating
system to guide selection of investments. ShelterPoint’s portfolio is highly-rated, and these ratings encompass the
potential for transition risk; in addition, the average duration of our bond portfolio is approximately four years,
significantly limiting transition risk. Finally, please see our response to question 1 in regard to our substantial
investment in ESG money market funds.
Metrics and Targets — narrative
4, Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities where
such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:

* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your business. Please
specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to assess, if any.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy
and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:

+ In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the amount of

exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related physical risks [answer in

absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable
maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.
ShelterPoint measures risks and opportunities in its risk management process using an economic value model. Key
risks, including natural disaster risk, are measured by their impact to the baseline company economic value using
scenario analysis. Aside from business operations risk as addressed by DR/CP, given our mix of business and the
fact that each line of business may be repriced annually as the risk evolves (subject to regulatory approval and
applicable statute), ShelterPoint does not believe climate risk will meaningfully impact future profitability.
Because of our mix of business, we do not currently employ catastrophe modelling.

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks.
Given the nature and size of ShelterPoint's business, the company emits minimal greenhouse gases relative to
other businesses. Furthermore, ShelterPoint has adopted a policy to enable employees to work remotely, which
further reduces emissions by reducing automobile and other miles travelled, and reduces paper usage as well.
Please see our response to question 1 for more in this regard.

C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance
against targets.

Given the nature of our business and risks, ShelterPoint does not currently manage our business using such
targets.

The insurer manages climate -related risks in accordance with its established
process for natural peril risks which includes careful and continuous review of
models, methods and assumptions used to quantify natural perils risk,
including assessment of what impact global trends such as climate change may
have.
The insurer uses third-party property catastrophe models and its proprietary
catastrophe models, and underwriting and pricing tools. The insurer's climate
risk mitigation efforts include developing catastrophe modeling tools, in-house
research and climate event modeling. In-house climate experts also educate
employees about the direct impact of climate-related events.

TCFD-ALIGNED QUESTIONS
UPDATED 2022
GOVERNANCE
1. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
> Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company (“SFBLI”, or “the company”) offers life insurance in
11 states and does not view climate-related risks as having a direct impact on its operations. As
such, it does not currently have employees specifically dedicated to analysis of climate-related
risks. However, the company does recognize the secondary effect that storm severity, carbon-
related economics, environmental issues, and regulation can have on its operation, and relies on
various risk-focused committees and departments to address potential impacts. Functional groups
include the Investment Committee, Product Committee, Reinsurance Committee, Strategic
Management Office, and Vendor Management Office. Each is tasked with identifying and
managing all risks within their areas, including climate-related factors. Committees and
departments regularly update senior management and the ERM Committee as appropriate on
their activity.
In disclosing the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities insurers should
consider including the following:
* Identify and include any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and opportunities.
> The company does not currently have a publicly stated goal related to climate risk.
* Describe where climate-related disclosure is handled within the insurer’s structure, e.g., at a group level,
entity level, or a combination. If handled at the group level, describe what activities are undertaken at the
company level.
> The company isa closely-held entity that is not part of a larger control group. Climate-related
disclosures, if any, would be specific to the life insurance operations at the home office.
However, the company does not issue public debt or equity, does not issue mainstream (ie.
public) annual filings, and has no climate-related disclosures.
A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and
opportunities.
> The company’s ERM Committee is responsible for oversight of all financial, operational, and
strategic risks faced by the company. The committee is comprised of officers and senior
officers representing all areas of company operation, including legal, marketing, investments,
actuarial, technology, and data analytics. The ERM Committee reports annually to the Audit
Committee of the Board on the company's solvency assessment and all risk related activity. In
the reporting, there is no special attention to climate-related risk as the ERM Committee has
not rated climate or environmental risks as “high impact”.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
> Company management is responsible for identifying and assessing any risks that could affect
insurance operations, including those related to climate change. Please see item 1 above for a
partial list of risk-focused groups that assess all risk within their areas. A primary goal of risk-
management activity is maintaining the company’s robust surplus position and thereby the
ability to follow through on the financial commitment to the company’s life insurance
policyholders.

STRATEGY
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
> Asa regional life insurance provider, the company believes the most immediate impacts
related to climate-related risks will be on its investment portfolio and its ability to sell life
insurance. These risks are addressed directly in the company’s strategy, risk appetite, and
annual planning. Please see 2.A below for additional description of the scenarios utilized in the
annual ORSA (Own Risk Solvency Assessment) reporting. The modeled financial impact of each
is disclosed as part of the ORSA report that was submitted to the Mississippi Department of
Insurance.
In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
businesses, strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and
resiliency. *
> The company actively engages with and supports the various Farm Bureau organizations in the
states where it provides insurance. The Farm Bureau organizations in every state have a long-
standing interest in preserving the environment and the sustainability of farms and farming
communities.
* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its operations
or organizations. *
> The company has no current plan to fully assess greenhouse gas emission in its operation. The
company operates out of a single building in Jackson, MS, while its agency force is dispersed across
11 states. The company provides life insurance to approximately 1 million policyholders and does
not believe its operation generates greenhouse gases in excess of other similarly-situated
businesses.
A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium,
and long term. In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the
short, medium, and longer term, insurers should consider including the following:
* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short term, 5-10 years as
medium term, and 10-30 years as long term.
> As part of its risk review, the ERM Committee has identified several insurance-related risks that
could stem from climate change. The effect of each scenario on surplus and income is
modeled annually as part of the company’s ORSA (Own Risk Solvency Assessment). Scenarios
are not climate-risk specific, but rather focus on the outcome that environmental changes
(among others) might have on company operations and financials. The projection period is 40
years, but the effect of some risks is reflected immediately. Scenarios include :
+ Short-term : a 1-year pandemic mortality event. One version of this scenario is
a disease that flourishes and spreads rapidly during a period of increased global
temperatures, and causes a significant increase in life insurance claims. The
company has partially mitigated this financial risk through reinsurance
agreements on its life insurance products.
+ Short-term : a significant decline in sales over a 1-to-3 year period. One version
of this scenario is an increase in the number and severity of weather-related
property claims that consumes time and energy in the company's distribution

channel that is otherwise spent on life insurance activity. The company uses a
multi-line agency force of independent contractors, and the company accepts
this strategic risk.

+ Long-term : higher than expected mortality experience. One version of this
scenario is higher global temperatures that result in additional cases of heat
stroke, cardiac events, respiratory issues, and other heat-related mortality. The
company has partially mitigated this financial risk through regular analysis of
mortality trends and through reinsurance agreements on its life insurance
products.

= Long-term : expense growth. One version of this scenario is higher-than-
expected expense inflation related to regulatory compliance, wage growth, or
other factors that are directly or indirectly caused by changing climate
conditions. The company regularly monitors its expense trends, but largely
accepts this financial risk.

+ Short and long-term : low or volatile investment returns. These scenarios
include severe short-term losses to the equity portfolio, short-term shocks to
the default rate in the fixed income portfolio, and long-term changes in the
interest rate environment. While the scenarios are not climate-risk specific, the
impacts reflect some of the possible effects of climate changes. The company
attempts to avoid these risks by actively managing its investment portfolio. See
additional commentary in 2.8 below.

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and
financial planning.
> Please see 2.A above for description of climate-related risks.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and
financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low
carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
> The company provides life insurance to approximately 1 million policyholders across 11 states,
thereby helping customers that might be financially impacted by climate-related mortality
risks. The company provides financial security across all mortality causes and does not focus its
services on climate-related risks.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.
> The company is mindful of the environmental risk exposure in its investment portfolio. The
overall investing objective is markets and companies that provide long-term viability and the
best expected return subject to risk constraints, including environmental, social, and
governance factors. Currently, the company feels that most valuations already reflect these
risks for industries with high carbon emissions that may suffer from asset risk, regulatory risk,
or consumption risk. While the company currently holds investments in these industries, itis
generally not reinvesting in these segments as the holdings mature. In addition, the limited
partnership portfolio is no longer focusing on energy specific funds.

For commercial real estate holdings with exposure to coastal weather, the company requires
insurance coverage, including loss-of-rent insurance, and spreads exposure across geography
to avoid physical concentration risk.
The company's Investment Policy provides guidance and limits on exposure by asset type,
rating, holder, and industry.
The company believes these common-sense measures align with the current economic and
investment environment and the general trend in the insurance industry toward
environmentally conscious investing. However, the company’s primary investment focus will
always be long-term fiscal stability that supports the financial security to its policyholders,
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
> The company's primary risk metric is a strong surplus position, with a stated goal of
maintaining an A+ financial rating from AM Best. The ORSA process provides an annual
evaluation of adjusted surplus in relation to the various identified risks, with a risk metric of
less than a 5% probability of a 30% drop in adjusted surplus. Identified risks include those
listed in 2.A above, as well as other financial and operational factors. The company met the
metric in the 2023 ORSA evaluation.
In particular, the second item described in 2.A (a sharp drop in sales over 1-to-3 years) is the
scenario the company believes is most directly tied to climate and environmental risks.
Company income and surplus remain steady even in the scenario of a 30% drop in sales for a
given calendar year.
The company’s RBC ratio for 2023 is 665%.
In addition, the company maintains other programs to provide financial and operation
continuity, including :
* access to additional liquidity through participation in the FHLB
+ a robust work-from-home network established during the COVID-19 pandemic
+ a large-scale generator and on-site water tank to maintain IT processes at the home
office in the case of public utility interruptions
+ an off-site business continuity facility for use in situations where the home office
building is unavailable
RISK MANAGEMENT
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
> Please see the section on Governance above.
In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers
should consider including the following:
* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting
portfolio, and how the company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to physical,
transition and liability risk. *
> The company provides life insurance to residents of 11 states and monitors its mortality, lapse,
and expense experience annually. Claims experience across all causes is reviewed monthly.
The company believes the effect of transition risks (such as customer preference, regulatory

compliance, and new carbon-related markets, as they relate to climate risk) will emerge over
time and will be reflected in regular analysis of sales and persistency. Physical risks (such as
storm-related mortality) will similarly emerge in the company's mortality analysis. Short-term,
acute mortality is addressed by maintaining a healthy level of surplus.
* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential
physical and transition climate related risks, if applicable. *
> At this time, the company does not directly engage its life insurance policyholders on issues
related to climate risk.
* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment
portfolio, including what investment classes have been considered. *
» Please see Section 2.B above.
A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
> Please see the section on Governance above, and the list of identified risk scenarios in section
2.A above.
In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers should
consider including the following:
* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how frequently
the process is completed. *
> The company’s ERM Committee has oversight responsibility in identifying and evaluating risk,
including climate-related risks. The committee meets at least twice annually to discuss areas of
risk exposure, receive reports on risk management activity in critical areas, and review and
approve corporate governance policies. In particular, the committee receives and reviews the
results of the annual ORSA evaluation, which includes scenario analysis across multiple risk
sources and an assessment of the impact on income and surplus. Several scenarios, as
described in Section 2.A, reflect the potential impact of climate and environmental risks.
B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.
> The company’s process for managing climate-related risks is part of its process for managing
traditional risks. The ERM Committee maintains a register of risks, which includes a “risk
owner” and a relative score for each based on severity, likelihood, and time to impact. Many
risks are further analyzed and monitored by associated company committees/functions, such
as the Investment Committee, Vendor Management Office, Strategic Management Office, and
Product Committee. The company does not have a committee/function dedicated to climate
risks.
The company also maintains a business continuity program that incorporates off-site data
backups, an off-site office area, an on-site generator, and an on-site water tank.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into
the insurer's overall risk management.
> Please see the section on Governance above, and the list of identified risk scenarios in section
2.A above.

In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated
into the insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-risk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
> Climate-related risks are managed through the general enterprise risk management process.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.
> Scenario testing and analysis is not specific to climate risk but focuses on outcomes. Outcomes
may or may not be attributable to environmental events or changes in climate. The company
believes the primary risks from environmental changes relate to its life insurance operations
and include changes in life expectancy, changes in sales or distribution, and changes in
investment opportunities. Please see the scenarios described in Section 2.A above.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.
> Please see the scenarios described in Section 2.A above.
METRICS AND TARGETS
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material. In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage
relevant collateralized risks and opportunities where such information is material, insurers should consider
including the following:
* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your
business. Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to
assess, if any.
> The company is a life insurance operation and is not directly exposed to property and casualty
risks. It does not currently use weather-related catastrophe modeling to manage risk. It does
evaluate a pandemic mortality scenario and its impact on surplus and income.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line
with its strategy and risk management process.
> The company does not currently use climate-specific risk metrics. The company's primary risk
metric is maintaining an A+ rating with AM Best, which is based on maintaining a strong surplus
position, The associated risk limit is less than a 5% probability of a 30% drop in adjusted
surplus. Identified risks used in the calculation include those listed in 2.A above, as welll as
other financial and operational factors.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line
with its strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:
+ In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible, alignment with climate
scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount
of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.

C. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related
risks.
> The company does not formally monitor Scope 1, 2, or 3 GHG emissions.
D. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
> The company does not have formal performance targets or risk metrics for climate-related
risks.
* Asterisks represent questions derived from the original Climate Risk Disclosure Survey.

Governance Questions

1. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
a. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-
related risks and opportunities.

Company Response:
The Standard’s Board of Directors has oversight of all risk activities across The Standard. At the Board
level, the Audit Committee is responsible for the assessment and management of the financial risks from
climate-related risks, including review of management actions taken to monitor and control such
exposures.
The Audit Committee of The Standard Life Insurance Company of New York (SNY) Board of Directors
oversees climate-related risks and opportunities through the lens of The Standard’s Enterprise Risk
‘Management (ERM) framework. The Standard’s Board's Nominating & Corporate Governance
Committee oversees our annual Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting and advises
management on opportunities and areas for further focus. The AVP & Actuary, Corporate Actuarial and
Risk Management is responsible for presenting an annual update of tolerances, limits and opportunities
to The Standard’s Board. This update occurs annually, at minimum, with the latest update provided in
November 2023 as part of an ERM update.
‘The Standard’s Board participates in ongoing climate-related risk education sessions, completing the
most recent session in February 2023.

b. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and
opportunities.
Company Response:
Climate-related risk assessment and management is under the direct oversight of the AVP & Actuary,
Corporate Actuarial and Risk Management. The Corporate ERM team reports to the CRO and oversees the
identification, measurement and management of all material risks, including climate-related risk, on an
enterprise basis.
The AVP & Actuary, Corporate Actuarial and Risk Management receives regular reports from the ERM team
regarding climate-related risks and opportunities. These updates occur both on an ad-hoc and recurring
bases. In 2022, the ERM team began including updates on climate-related risk in the existing quarterly risk
dashboard. This dashboard is produced by the ERM team, reviewed and approved by the CRO and
distributed to the Management Committee.
The AVP & Actuary, Corporate Actuarial and Risk Management is responsible for presenting an annual
update of tolerances, limits and opportunities to the Board. This update occurs, at minimum, as part of an
annual ERM update in the fall of each year. Senior management participates in ongoing climate-related risk
education sessions. The next session is scheduled for October 2024.
‘The Standard has an established Environmental, Social and Governance Committee, representing key
functions across the organization. The committee has established a framework that references select
external measures and benchmarks, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
framework. The company is focused on these SDG areas: Climate Action, Sustainable Cities and
Communities, and Good Heath & Wellbeing. For additional information, please see our Environmental,
Social and Governance Report.
Strategy Questions
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and
opportunities on the insurer’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where
such information is material
a. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified
over the short, medium, and long term.

Company Response:
The Standard does not formally define short, medium and long term but considers our climate-related
risks over different time horizons. Generally, the company considers the short-term as three years or
less, medium-term as three to ten years, and long-term as greater than ten years.
The Standard is exposed to physical, transition and liability climate-related risks. Understanding impacts
of climate-related risks is important to The Standard. We recognize the speed of onset for climate-
related risks can occur over longer horizons when compared to our organization’s other significant and
key risks. The Standard expects the speed of onset for most climate-related risks to be over the long-
term but recognizes climate-related weather events could happen at any time.
As a group life insurer, The Standard is exposed to physical risks through geographic concentration of life
insurance volumes. In general, The Standard’ life insurance portfolio is geographically diverse, except for
some concentration in Northern California. Our Employee Benefits department produces frequent
updates on group concentration risk, including an annual report provided to management. The Standard
is continuing to develop its understanding of its group concentration risk, including the effects of the
remote work and the impacts of climate-related risks.
Transition risk related to credit and spread risks for corporate bonds is expected to vary significantly by
industry and investment class. Industry and credit risk are already integral in The Standard’s investment
underwriting. The Investment team considers Environment, Social and Governance goals when selecting
appropriate assets for The Standard’s portfolio. Further analysis on climate-related aspects of this are
planned as The Standard’s risk response develops in sophistication.
The Standard’s commercial mortgage volume also exposes The Standard to transition risk characteristics
unique to that asset class, such as borrower's industry and local economic impacts. The Standard’s
commercial mortgage portfolio increases its exposure to physical risks. The portfolio tends towards small
assets, businesses and retailers and is geographically diverse which helps limit the impact of catastrophic
and systemic impacts of climate-related risks. The Standard monitors the geographic and sector
concentration of its mortgage portfolio and includes flooding and other catastrophic risk exposures in its
underwriting decisions.
The Standard’s liability risk, defined as the risk of future claims from those affected by climate-related
risks seeking compensation from those they perceive as responsible, is mitigated through corporate
insurance.

b. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
business, strategy, and financial planning.
Company Response:

The Standard addresses climate-related risks and sustainability as part of its overall business strategy.
The Standard strives to implement initiatives that protect the environment and address risks from
climate-related change, recognizing that the health and security of our customers and employees as well
as our business success are linked to the health of the planet.
The Standard has identified three UN Sustainable Development Goals that offer an opportunity to make
a difference, including sustainable cities and communities and combating climate-related change. In
2023, the company conducted a carbon assessment to identify opportunities for reduction and
mitigation strategies. Emissions are expected to decline in future years as the company revisits its real
estate footprint and reduces or resizes owned and leased office spaces.
The Standard has identified current and anticipated risks that climate-related change poses to our
company. As our core products are group life and disability insurance, The Standard is not directly
exposed to the potential physical effects of climate-related risks like a property and casualty insurer may
be. However, we do business across the United States and there are many indirect risks associated with
climate-related risk including:

‘© Increased mortality

‘* Increased morbidity and/or decreased disability claim termination rates

‘© Pressure on the businesses of our customer base

‘© Property damage or property value degradation due to severe weather

‘© Regulatory, litigation, competitiveness and reputational risks to the investments we purchase

‘© General operations risks ~ scarce energy, IT systems failures, workforce planning and business

continuity

© Higher credit risk to investments due to a transitioning economy

‘* Increased macroeconomic volatility
The Standard employs a process for identifying climate-related risks and assessing their potential impact
on our business, including financial implications. The company incorporates the study of economic,
demographic and environmental trends ~ all of which may be affected by climate-related change ~ in its
regular risk management activities. These activities include pricing and underwriting group insurance
cases, diversifying and monitoring the investment portfolio, reserve adequacy testing and improving the
efficiency and sustainability of business operations.
While not a direct financial risk, The Standard is also closely monitoring the increased regulatory focus
across all regulatory bodies on climate-related risk including increased expectations on reporting,
governance, and potential changes to the competitive landscape.

c. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration
different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
‘Company Response:
The Standard has begun to create a climate-related risk management strategy which will incorporate
climate-related risk scenarios into the ORSA Solvency Scenario. This may include a 2-degree scenario,
transition risk sensitivity scenario, morbidity and mortality risk sensitivity scenarios.
Available capital and liquidity are assessed against normal and stressed conditions to determine if it is
enough to withstand the assumed exposure in each scenario.
The company holds catastrophe reinsurance on our group life/AD&D lines of business to improve
resiliency during singular disasters or accidents related to climate change. This reinsurance is staggered
so that half of our coverage renews each year, allowing for continuity of coverage in case of market
disruption due to a catastrophic or other event. The group life/AD&D and health lines of business are
offered on an annually renewable basis, allowing flexibility in adapting to emerging risks.
‘The Standard tracks many metrics and reports that understand its risk landscape. Currently available
metrics and reports that help the company understand its exposure to climate-related risk include fixed
income credit ratings, investment concentration reports, analysis performed by third party groups to
gauge our ESG positioning relative to peers, commercial mortgage geographic concentration reports and
life insurance geographic concentration reports. Changes in exposure are analyzed and reported to
senior leaders each quarter.
Risk Management Questions
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
a. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related
risks.

Company Response:
Climate-related risks and opportunities are monitored and reported by the Corporate ERM function at The
Standard with direct oversight from the AVP & Actuary, Corporate Actuarial and Risk Management. In
August 2022, the Chief Risk Officer was designated as the senior management representative responsible
for the oversight and management of climate-related risks. In April 2024, in response to a change in
management personnel, the AVP & Actuary, Corporate Actuarial and Risk Management was designated by
‘the company as the senior management representative responsible for the oversight and management of
climate-related risks. The SNY Board of Directors’ Audit committee is also formally designated as being
responsible for climate-related risk oversight.
Within the current organizational risk taxonomy, climate-related risk is defined as “The risk of loss
associated with global climate-related events” which is classified as a significant risk. Aspects of climate-
related risk are also covered by bond, credit spread, mortgages, macroeconomic risk and concentration /
catastrophe risk.
Climate-related risk is regularly monitored and reported to the Board. As part of our ongoing monitoring
process, capital is measured and reviewed quarterly by accounting and actuarial staff. Capital
management decisions and business planning decisions are made with a view towards the potential future
impact relative to minimum targets.

b. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks

Company Response:

On an ongoing basis, The Standard identifies, assesses, mitigates, reports and monitors material risks
through the ERM program. The Standard tracks various metrics and reports to understand its risk
landscape. Currently available metrics and reports that help the company understand its exposure to
climate-related risks include fixed Income credit ratings, investment concentration reports, peer
analysis performed by third party groups to gauge our ESG positioning relative to peers, commercial
mortgage geographic concentration reports and life Insurance geographic concentration reports.
The Standard is researching and developing new metrics that will help it understand its climate-
related risk exposure. Carbon emissions for scope 1 & 2 were reported in the 2023 Environmental,
Social and Governance Report. Research into understanding its scope 3 emissions has also begun. A
climate-related risk materiality assessment has identified areas where additional metrics and limits
should be prioritized. We are currently developing new metrics to include in the reports created by
the Corporate ERM team.
The Standards existing limits and targets help limit its exposure to climate-related risks, which
include:
‘© The Standard and SNY Investment Policy limits for concentration and asset type
© Commercial mortgage concentration limits
‘© Group Life Insurance Geographic Concentration Policy
The Standard holds catastrophic reinsurance on the group life/AD&D lines of business to mitigate risk
associated with singular accidents or disasters.
The Standard undertook a review of its limits, policies, and exposures as they relate to climate-
related investment risks. Recommendations for additions and changes based on The Standard’s,
broader risk appetite statement and characteristics of risk are being presented to the Board of
Directors for approval. Implementation is expected to be complete within the coming year.

c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related

risks are integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.

‘Company Response:
‘The Standard addresses climate-related risk within its current Risk Management Framework. Aspects of
climate-related risk are also covered by bond risk, mortgage risk, mortality / morbidity risk,
macroeconomic risk, and concentration / catastrophe risk.
Capital management and business planning decisions are made with a view towards the potential future
impact relative to risk tolerance. The Standard tracks a comprehensive set of metrics and reports to
understand its risk landscape. See responses for question 3a for further details.
‘The Standard reviewed its limits and policies related to climate-related investment risk, and
recommended additions and changes informed by its broader risk appetite statement and characteristics
of risk. These recommendations are being presented to the Board of Directors for approval with
implementation expected to be complete by yearend 2025.
Metrics and Targets Questions
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized
risks and opportunities where such information is material
a. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and
opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.
‘Company Response:

Climate-related transition risk relates primarily to The Standard’s investments, which are mostly comprised
of corporate bonds and commercial mortgages. Transition risk related to credit and spread risks for
corporate bonds is expected to vary significantly by industry and investment class. The Standard’s volume of
commercial mortgages also exposes The Standard to transition risk characteristics unique to that asset class
such as borrower's industry and local economic impacts. Industry and credit risk are an integral part of The
Standard’s investment underwriting.

The Standard incorporates analysis of environmental, social and governance factors into our holistic credit
underwriting and portfolio management practices. As of 2021, we utilize five outside investment managers
for specific portions of the portfolio, each a direct signatory of the United Nations-supported Principles for
Responsible Investment or part of a larger organization that is also a signatory. As such, these managers
have agreed to certain principals for reporting and assessing ESG factors and their incorporation into the
investment processes. The Standard also uses analysis performed by third party groups to gauge our ESG
positioning relative to peers. Further analysis on climate-related aspects of the investment portfolio is
recommended as part of The Standard’s policy changes being presented to the Board of Directors for
approval. This will enhance The Standard’s risk response as capabilities develop in sophistication.

The Standard’s commercial mortgage portfolio increases its exposure to physical risks. The portfolio tends
‘towards small businesses and retailers and is geographically diverse which helps limit the impact of
catastrophic and systemic impacts of climate-related risks. The Standard monitors the geographic and
sector concentration of its mortgage portfolio, and these concentrations are considered during the
underwriting process. The Investment Policy Statement places limits on the size of a single property type
(retail, office, industrial or multifamily) to not exceed 50% of the mortgage portfolio, and hospitality
properties not to exceed 10% of the total mortgage portfolio. It also states that no more than 40% of the
total mortgage portfolio will be in any single state. Mortgage underwriting guidelines also evaluate risks,
such as earthquake risk, at the time of loan origination. Further analysis on climate-related aspects of the
mortgage portfolio is recommended as part of The Standard’s policy changes being presented to the Board
of Directors for approval.

As a group life insurer, The Standard is also exposed to physical risk through geographic concentration of
life insurance volumes. In general, The Standards life portfolio is geographically diverse, except for
Northern California. The Employee Benefits department produces frequent updates on group concentration
risk, including an annual report provided to management. The Standard is continuing to develop its,
understanding of its group concentration risk and associated climate-related risk impacts.

A small majority of the company's workforce is concentrated in the region surrounding our home office in
Portland, Oregon. The company’s primary real estate holdings are also located in this area. As work from
home has become more prevalent, employee concentration has improved but risk from a major seismic
event remains. Disaster recovery programs and business continuity efforts are targeting these risks.

The Standard has performed a Climate Risk materiality assessment to identify areas where additional
metrics and limits should be prioritized. We are currently developing new metrics to include in the reports
created by the Corporate ERM team.

b. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, and the related risks
Company Response:
The Standard is researching and developing new metrics that will help it understand its climate-related risk
exposure. 2022 GHG emissions for scopes 1 & 2 were reported in the 2023 ESG Report. Scope 1 direct
emissions totaled 1,409 metric tons (CO2e). Market-based Scope 2 emissions totaled 1,656.6 metric (CO2e).
Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in 2022 totaled 3,065 metric tons (CO2e). Our GHG emissions are tied
primarily to company-owned facilities and energy sources. Preliminary GHG emissions data for 2023 show a
material decline from 2022 totals as the company continues to resize owned and leased office spaces that
comprise the company’s real estate footprint. Scope 3 GHG emissions are not measured currently but
preliminary research into understanding our Scope 3 emissions has begun. The company is closely
monitoring legislation in several states mandating the collection and reporting of Scope 3 GHG emissions.
The Standard will be prepared to report this information as regulators require.
c. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and
opportunities and performance against targets
Company Response:
The Standard plans to further align our climate-related risk disclosures with recommendations of the ISSB.
In 2023 we completed our Climate Risk materiality assessment and will be using these results to inform
future disclosures. We are establishing an approach to integrate carbon-reduction targets into our
operations. The Standard will work towards setting targets appropriate for climate-related risk
management within our overall framework.

as our business success are linked to the health of the planet.
The Standard has identified three UN Sustainable Development Goals that offer an opportunity to make
a difference, including sustainable cities and communities and combating climate-related change. In
2023, the company conducted a carbon assessment to identify opportunities for reduction and
mitigation strategies. Emissions are expected to decline in future years as the company revisits its real
estate footprint and reduces or resizes owned and leased office spaces.
The Standard has identified current and anticipated risks that climate-related change poses to our
company. As our core products are group life and disability insurance, The Standard is not directly
exposed to the potential physical effects of climate-related risks like a property and casualty insurer may
be. However, we do business across the United States and there are many indirect risks associated with
climate-related risk including:

‘© Increased mortality

‘* Increased morbidity and/or decreased disability claim termination rates

‘© Pressure on the businesses of our customer base

‘© Property damage or property value degradation due to severe weather

‘© Regulatory, litigation, competitiveness and reputational risks to the investments we purchase

‘© General operations risks ~ scarce energy, IT systems failures, workforce planning and business

continuity

© Higher credit risk to investments due to a transitioning economy

‘* Increased macroeconomic volatility
The Standard employs a process for identifying climate-related risks and assessing their potential impact,
on our business, including financial implications. The company incorporates the study of economic,
demographic and environmental trends ~ all of which may be affected by climate-related change ~ in its
regular risk management activities. These activities include pricing and underwriting group insurance
cases, diversifying and monitoring the investment portfolio, reserve adequacy testing and improving the
efficiency and sustainability of business operations.
While not a direct financial risk, The Standard is also closely monitoring the increased regulatory focus
across all regulatory bodies on climate-related risk including increased expectations on reporting,
governance, and potential changes to the competitive landscape.

c. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration
different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
‘Company Response:
The Standard has begun to create a climate-related risk management strategy which will incorporate
climate-related risk scenarios into the ORSA Solvency Scenario. This may include a 2-degree scenario,
transition risk sensitivity scenario, morbidity and mortality risk sensitivity scenarios.
Available capital and liquidity are assessed against normal and stressed conditions to determine if it is
enough to withstand the assumed exposure in each scenario.
The company holds catastrophe reinsurance on our group life/AD&D lines of business to improve
resiliency during singular disasters or accidents related to climate change. This reinsurance is staggered
so that half of our coverage renews each year, allowing for continuity of coverage in case of market
disruption due to a catastrophic or other event. The group life/AD&D and health lines of business are
offered on an annually renewable basis, allowing flexibility in adapting to emerging risks.
‘The Standard tracks many metrics and reports that understand its risk landscape. Currently available
metrics and reports that help the company understand its exposure to climate-related risk include fixed
income credit ratings, investment concentration reports, analysis performed by third party groups to
gauge our ESG positioning relative to peers, commercial mortgage geographic concentration reports and
life insurance geographic concentration reports. Changes in exposure are analyzed and reported to
senior leaders each quarter.
Risk Management Questions
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
a. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related
risks.

Company Response:
Climate-related risks and opportunities are monitored and reported by the Corporate ERM function at The
Standard with direct oversight from the AVP & Actuary, Corporate Actuarial and Risk Management. In
August 2022, the Chief Risk Officer was designated as the senior management representative responsible
for the oversight and management of climate-related risks. In April 2024, in response to a change in
management personnel, the AVP & Actuary, Corporate Actuarial and Risk Management was designated by
‘the company as the senior management representative responsible for the oversight and management of
climate-related risks. The SNY Board of Directors’ Audit committee is also formally designated as being
responsible for climate-related risk oversight.
Within the current organizational risk taxonomy, climate-related risk is defined as “The risk of loss
associated with global climate-related events” which is classified as a significant risk. Aspects of climate-
related risk are also covered by bond, credit spread, mortgages, macroeconomic risk and concentration /
catastrophe risk.
Climate-related risk is regularly monitored and reported to the Board. As part of our ongoing monitoring
process, capital is measured and reviewed quarterly by accounting and actuarial staff. Capital
management decisions and business planning decisions are made with a view towards the potential future
impact relative to minimum targets.

b. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks

Company Response:

On an ongoing basis, The Standard identifies, assesses, mitigates, reports and monitors material risks
through the ERM program. The Standard tracks various metrics and reports to understand its risk
landscape. Currently available metrics and reports that help the company understand its exposure to
climate-related risks include fixed Income credit ratings, investment concentration reports, peer
analysis performed by third party groups to gauge our ESG positioning relative to peers, commercial
mortgage geographic concentration reports and life Insurance geographic concentration reports.
The Standard is researching and developing new metrics that will help it understand its climate-
related risk exposure. Carbon emissions for scope 1 & 2 were reported in the 2023 Environmental,
Social and Governance Report. Research into understanding its scope 3 emissions has also begun. A
climate-related risk materiality assessment has identified areas where additional metrics and limits
should be prioritized. We are currently developing new metrics to include in the reports created by
the Corporate ERM team.
The Standards existing limits and targets help limit its exposure to climate-related risks, which
include:
‘© The Standard and SNY Investment Policy limits for concentration and asset type
© Commercial mortgage concentration limits
‘© Group Life Insurance Geographic Concentration Policy
The Standard holds catastrophic reinsurance on the group life/AD&D lines of business to mitigate risk
associated with singular accidents or disasters.
The Standard undertook a review of its limits, policies, and exposures as they relate to climate-
related investment risks. Recommendations for additions and changes based on The Standard’s,
broader risk appetite statement and characteristics of risk are being presented to the Board of
Directors for approval. Implementation is expected to be complete within the coming year.

c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related

risks are integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.

‘Company Response:
‘The Standard addresses climate-related risk within its current Risk Management Framework. Aspects of
climate-related risk are also covered by bond risk, mortgage risk, mortality / morbidity risk,
macroeconomic risk, and concentration / catastrophe risk.
Capital management and business planning decisions are made with a view towards the potential future
impact relative to risk tolerance. The Standard tracks a comprehensive set of metrics and reports to
understand its risk landscape. See responses for question 3a for further details.
‘The Standard reviewed its limits and policies related to climate-related investment risk, and
recommended additions and changes informed by its broader risk appetite statement and characteristics
of risk. These recommendations are being presented to the Board of Directors for approval with
implementation expected to be complete by yearend 2025.
Metrics and Targets Questions
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized
risks and opportunities where such information is material
a. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and
opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.
‘Company Response:

Climate-related transition risk relates primarily to The Standard’s investments, which are mostly comprised
of corporate bonds and commercial mortgages. Transition risk related to credit and spread risks for
corporate bonds is expected to vary significantly by industry and investment class. The Standard’s volume of
commercial mortgages also exposes The Standard to transition risk characteristics unique to that asset class
such as borrower's industry and local economic impacts. Industry and credit risk are an integral part of The
Standard’s investment underwriting.

The Standard incorporates analysis of environmental, social and governance factors into our holistic credit
underwriting and portfolio management practices. As of 2021, we utilize five outside investment managers
for specific portions of the portfolio, each a direct signatory of the United Nations-supported Principles for
Responsible Investment or part of a larger organization that is also a signatory. As such, these managers
have agreed to certain principals for reporting and assessing ESG factors and their incorporation into the
investment processes. The Standard also uses analysis performed by third party groups to gauge our ESG
positioning relative to peers. Further analysis on climate-related aspects of the investment portfolio is
recommended as part of The Standard’s policy changes being presented to the Board of Directors for
approval. This will enhance The Standard’s risk response as capabilities develop in sophistication.

The Standard’s commercial mortgage portfolio increases its exposure to physical risks. The portfolio tends
‘towards small businesses and retailers and is geographically diverse which helps limit the impact of
catastrophic and systemic impacts of climate-related risks. The Standard monitors the geographic and
sector concentration of its mortgage portfolio, and these concentrations are considered during the
underwriting process. The Investment Policy Statement places limits on the size of a single property type
(retail, office, industrial or multifamily) to not exceed 50% of the mortgage portfolio, and hospitality
properties not to exceed 10% of the total mortgage portfolio. It also states that no more than 40% of the
total mortgage portfolio will be in any single state. Mortgage underwriting guidelines also evaluate risks,
such as earthquake risk, at the time of loan origination. Further analysis on climate-related aspects of the
mortgage portfolio is recommended as part of The Standard’s policy changes being presented to the Board
of Directors for approval.

As a group life insurer, The Standard is also exposed to physical risk through geographic concentration of
life insurance volumes. In general, The Standards life portfolio is geographically diverse, except for
Northern California. The Employee Benefits department produces frequent updates on group concentration
risk, including an annual report provided to management. The Standard is continuing to develop its,
understanding of its group concentration risk and associated climate-related risk impacts.

A small majority of the company's workforce is concentrated in the region surrounding our home office in
Portland, Oregon. The company’s primary real estate holdings are also located in this area. As work from
home has become more prevalent, employee concentration has improved but risk from a major seismic
event remains. Disaster recovery programs and business continuity efforts are targeting these risks.

The Standard has performed a Climate Risk materiality assessment to identify areas where additional
metrics and limits should be prioritized. We are currently developing new metrics to include in the reports
created by the Corporate ERM team.

b. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, and the related risks
Company Response:
The Standard is researching and developing new metrics that will help it understand its climate-related risk
exposure. 2022 GHG emissions for scopes 1 & 2 were reported in the 2023 ESG Report. Scope 1 direct
emissions totaled 1,409 metric tons (CO2e). Market-based Scope 2 emissions totaled 1,656.6 metric (CO2e).
Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in 2022 totaled 3,065 metric tons (CO2e). Our GHG emissions are tied
primarily to company-owned facilities and energy sources. Preliminary GHG emissions data for 2023 show a
material decline from 2022 totals as the company continues to resize owned and leased office spaces that
comprise the company’s real estate footprint. Scope 3 GHG emissions are not measured currently but
preliminary research into understanding our Scope 3 emissions has begun. The company is closely
monitoring legislation in several states mandating the collection and reporting of Scope 3 GHG emissions.
The Standard will be prepared to report this information as regulators require.
c. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and
opportunities and performance against targets
Company Response:
The Standard plans to further align our climate-related risk disclosures with recommendations of the ISSB.
In 2023 we completed our Climate Risk materiality assessment and will be using these results to inform
future disclosures. We are establishing an approach to integrate carbon-reduction targets into our
operations. The Standard will work towards setting targets appropriate for climate-related risk
management within our overall framework.

Committee (""ERMC""), which encompasses all of senior executive management of the Reliance Companies.
Board of Directors
TMHD's Board of Directors recognizes responding to climate change as a material management issue and
assumes the role of supervising Tokio Marine Holdings’ entire sustainability promotion scheme. The Board is
charged with discussion of Group sustainability policies including climate change countermeasures as well as
the evaluation and determination of mid-term and single-year plans. In monitoring the implementation status
of sustainability initiatives, it receives reports from the Sustainability Committee every quarter in principle and
provides instructions as necessary. In addition, the Board of Directors holds deliberation on corporate strategy
on the themes of the management environment and management issues, including climate action. Membership
includes outside directors and Audit/Supervisory Board members to fully utilize the knowledge available from
outside of TMHD.
‘At the Reliance Companies’ level, their intermediate parent company, Delphi Financial Group (Delphi), has
designated its Board of Directors as the body responsible for overseeing climate risks at its subsidiaries, including
the Reliance Companies. Delphi has also designated a member of its senior management; ie, its Senior Vice
President and Chief Risk Officer, as responsible for management of climate risks.
‘Compensation System for Directors and Executive Officers
In fiscal 2022, TM HD started incorporating non-financial indicators concerning the tasks on climate action and
other key issues in our sustainability strategy into the performance-linked compensation for Directors and
Executive Officers. TMHD uses the progress of each task toward our vision as an indicator, and after performing
the first assessment of compensation amounts at the Sustainability Committee, holds a deliberation and gives a
final decision at the Compensation Committee.
Organizational Structure for Promoting Sustainability
The TMHD Sustainability Division, CSUO, and Sustainability Committee are responsible for the promotion of

2. STRATEGY

Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's businesses,

strategy, and financial planning where such information is material. In disclosing the actual and potential impacts

of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's businesses, strategy and financial planning, insurers
should consider including the following:
* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and
resiliency.
+ Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its operations
of organizations.

‘A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium, and
long term. In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
medium, and longer term, insurers should consider including the following:

* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-Syears as short term, 5-10years as medium
term, and 10-30years as long term,

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business, strategy, and
financial_planning._In_describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
business, strategy, and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:

‘+ Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon economy,

C._ Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios,
including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

RESPONSE TO STRATEGY

In responding to climate change, which poses a global social issue critical to human history and important for the
Group, the Group promotes initiatives toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 in keeping with the promise
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As an insurance business operator (insurance products and services),
institutional investor and asset manager, the Group provides support both in terms of mitigating and adapting to
climate change and helps customers and investment and financing recipients solve their respective issues. Efforts
include providing insurance products and services to support the transition to a decarbonized society, such as
those promoting the more widespread use of renewable energy; providing insurance to cover damages caused by
natural disasters; services that will lead to prevention or reduction of damages; and undertaking sustainable
investment and financing.

‘As a global company, the Group intends to contribute to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change and

seek growth together with our stakeholders. Social contribution activities are also key to climate action. As

examples of such activities, the Group plants mangroves and engages in research and educational activities to
increase society's resilience, thereby contributing to climate action asa good corporate citizen in local communities
5

Recognition of Risks
‘The Group specifies climate change risk events by reflecting changes in the external and business environment
caused by the emergence of climate change, and identifies and assesses the impact on the Group. Climate-
related risks include risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (physical risks) and risks related to
the transition to a decarbonized society (transition risks).
Please see page 56 of the 2022 Annual Sustainability Report for a graphic depicting examples of Physical risks
and Transition risks for each risk category in the TCFD recommendations, as well as examples of risks from the
Group's business activities.
The Reliance Companies, as part of the Tokio Marine group, have a wide array of key ESG partners who we have
engaged to enhance our understanding of ESG risks and frameworks.
Under consideration of our ESG Committee we believe that reducing our companies’ environmental impact
and increasing climate awareness and education are desirable outcomes and that ensuring ethical operations
under principled and responsible leadership will lead to attracting and retaining team members who will
meaningfully contribute to the companies’ achieving their short- and long-term goals. The Reliance Companies
are in the process of reporting benchmark data to inform where there could be opportunities. While these plans
have not yet been made public, we will seek to be in a position to do so in the near future.
Policies Concerning Insurance Underwriting as well as Investment and Financing The Group's basic policy on
climate change is to support the de-carbonization of customers and local communities through insurance products
and services as well as investments and financing while basing our activities on constructive dialogue with
stakeholders. For investment and financing fields that could cause significant negative impacts on the environment or
society, the Group individually set up a policy on each transaction.
At the end of September 2020, TMHD published its thoughts on climate change in “Tokio Marine: Our Climate
Strategy,” which was revised at the end of September 2021 and the end of September 2022. In the statement,
TMHD commits itself to supporting the Group's clients and investees in the transition to a decarbonized society.
Insurance Underwriting
The Group will not provide new insurance underwriting capacities to coal-fired power generation projects or
thermal coal mining projects, regardless of whether they are newly constructed or not.
Exceptions may be granted for projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS ""==""
and mixed combustion, after careful consideration, aiming to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Since September 2022, the Group also strengthens its commitment by protecting the environment and
supporting the transition to a decarbonized society by no longer providing new insurance underwriting
capacities to oil and gas company extraction projects ""*** in the Arctic Circle (all areas north of latitude 66°33,
including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)) and oil sands mining
note 1 : Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage, Carbon dioxide Capture, Utilization and Storage
note 2 : Exemptions for projects with decarbonization plans that are aligned with the Paris Agreement

Investment and Financing
With respect to investment and financing, the Group will not provide new financing for coal-fired power
generation projects or thermal coal mining projects. As with the Group's insurance underwriting policy,
exceptions may be granted for projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS and
mixed combustion, after careful consideration, aiming to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
In aligning with our insurance underwriting policy, Tokio Marine Group is also no longer providing new financing
for oil and gas extraction projects in the Arctic Circle (all areas north of latitude 66°33, including the ANWR) and
oil sands mining and are stepping up our efforts to support the protection of the natural environment and
transition to a decarbonized society.

Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. TCFD Report2023 p22
The RSL ESG Committee, in furtherance of its ESG activities, including responding to climate change, will assess
the Reliance Companies’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 Green House Gas (""GHG"") emissions. Our first climate impact
report on GHG was issued in 2024 on 2022 data.
The Reliance Companies’ climate-related risk and opportunities over the short, medium and long-term can be
summarized as follows:

+ Short term (2023-2028): Focus on solidifying the mandate of the ESG Committee and set out the 2023
objectives to deliver on for Tokio Marine. Develop a reporting framework to measure the Reliance
Companies’ GHG emissions and define their carbon credit strategy (if determined to be necessary)

+ Medium term (2028-2038): Position the Reliance Companies to be designated as carbon neutral. Read
the final Climate Risk Guidance (which to a great extent remains subject to interpretation). Possibly
develop TCFD. Understand the various climate risk guidance/regulation that will become full in-effect.

‘+ Long Term (2038 and beyond): To be determined

The Reliance Companies will continue to analyze and determine the climate-related actions to implement in our
business operations, strategy and financial plans. The ESG committee will produce, as part of its existence,
climate strategies for executive management to consider and where appropriate implement.

In describing our resilience to climate-related scenarios, a 2-degree Celsius warming scenario would likely
increase the intensity of seasonal heat and humidity and may change the Reliance Companies’ strategy. Global
warming may lead to susceptibility to the growth of higher rates of human deaths and injuries, generally in the
geographic area of the United States. This in turn could lead to higher levels of losses in the companies’ Group
Life line of business (""GL"") with more heat related deaths for working populations. Similarly, higher levels of
injuries could lead to increases in claims in the companies’ Long-term and Short-term disability lines of business.
Since this scenario has not materialized to date, we may consider this with an increase in mortality assumptions
and model this as a possible scenario. In addition, a higher level of GL losses due to global warming could cause
Us to alter our reinsurance strategy to transfer higher levels of risk as necessary.

RESPONSE TO RISK MANAGEMENT

TMHD conducts enterprise risk management (ERM), which includes the management of climate risks. Through

the ERM cycle, TMHD comprehensively identifies and assesses risks, using both qualitative and quantitative

approaches (please see page 63 of the 2022 Annual Sustainability Report).

In the insurance business, which pursues profit through risk-taking, risk assessment is the foundation of the

Group's business. TMHD has been working for many years to assess material risks (including those due to

natural disasters) both quantitatively and qualitatively. Specific initiatives as part of the ERM Governance

Initiatives can be found on page 190 of the 2022 Annual Sustainability Report

8

(1) Qualitative Risk Management
TMHD identifies all forms of risk exhaustively, including natural disasters such as major storms and newly
emerging risks due to environmental changes. TMHD defines risks that will have an extremely large impact on
the Group's financial soundness and business continuity as “material risks.”
TMHD includes the risk of major windstorms and floods in the ""material risks” category, which could become
more frequent and severe due to the effects of climate change. TMHD also formulates control measures prior
to risk emergence and response measures for after risks occur.
(2) Quantitative Risk Management
For material risks, through measuring risk amounts and implementing stress tests as part of the TMHD’s
quantitative risk management, TMHD is able to perform a multifaceted review of the adequacy of capital
relative to the risks held for the purpose of maintaining ratings and preventing bankruptcy.
TMHD calculates risk amounts posed by natural disasters using a risk model (for Japan, a risk model
developed in-house based on engineering theory and the latest knowledge of natural disasters, and for
overseas, models provided by outside vendors). TMHD independently analyzes past tropical cyclones
(typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United States), torrential rains, and other changing trends and
incorporate this data as necessary in order to properly assess current weather phenomena
Furthermore, within material risks, TMHD conducts stress tests based on scenarios in which extreme economic
losses are expected and scenarios where multiple material risks occur at the same time. As for risks involving
major wind and flood disasters, for example, TMHD assumes these scenarios to be on a much larger scale than
the major typhoons that hit the Greater Tokyo Area in 2018 and 2019 causing extensive damages. TMHD
updates scenarios continuously while taking into account stress tests released by regulatory authorities of
every country, the latest knowledge (including that of climate change), and recent case studies.
Appropriately Control Risk through Risk Diversification and Reinsurance, etc.
Natural disasters are inevitable in Japan, the Group's home market. For that reason, TMHD has sought to
control risk capital by geographic, business, and product risk diversification through M&A overseas.
In addition, reinsurance, as a hedge against risk, is also an effective way to protect the Group's capital and
stabilize profits. The Group utilizes reinsurance to prepare for natural disasters (capital events) that occur once
every few centuries, and TMHD determines earnings coverage from the standpoint of economic rationality and
take necessary measures.
Acquisition of Knowledge (e.g., Industry-Academia Collaboration)
TMHD is deepening collaboration with both inside and outside experts to acquire knowledge about risks.
Tokio Marine Research Institute collaborates with The University of Tokyo, Nagoya University, and Kyoto
University, among others, to carry out impact analysis based on the possibility for increased insurance losses
associated with natural disasters that are becoming more severe in nature.

9

Moreover, Tokio Marine dR and a team of experts in natural disasters working in Atlanta, the United States, are
leading efforts to upgrade natural disaster risk management across the entire Group, including various
evaluations of natural disaster risk models.

Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. TCFD Report2023 p24, 25
Reliance Companies
In addition to the risk management activities conducted at the TMHD level, as described above, the Reliance
Companies have established an ESG Committee, which will from time to time produce reports and share climate-
related risk and opportunities in the pursuit of the Reliance Companies’ ESG long-term goals, which it will report
to the RSL Enterprise Risk Management Committee.
The Reliance Companies’ intermediate parent, Delphi Financial Group (Delphi), has designated its Board of
Directors as the body responsible for overseeing climate risks at its subsidiaries, including the Reliance
Companies. Delphi has also designated a member of its senior management; ie, its Senior Vice President and
Chief Risk Officer, as responsible for management of climate risks, with whom information reported at the
Reliance Companies’ level will be shared and who will, in turn, report such information to Delphi's Board.
Delphi has incorporated climate risk into its risk management policy in addition to its investment guidelines
(which govern the investments of the Reliance Companies), and has initiated a plan to manage climate risks
through existing enterprise risk management functions, including risk assessment, compliance, internal control,
internal audit, and actuarial functions.

4, Metrics and Targets

Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities where

such information is material. In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant

collateralized risks and opportunities where such information is material, insurers should consider including the
following:

Emissions Associated with the Group's Business Activities and Achieving Carbon Neutrality

Each Tokio Marine Group company is working to reduce the environmental impact associated with
its business activities, and at the same time, aims to achieve carbon neutrality on a global basis, in
which the amount of GHG fixed and reduced through mangrove planting and the use of natural
energy exceeds GHG (CO.) emissions from business activities.

Achieving Carbon Neutrality in Fiscal 2021
Reduction of GHG (CO2) emissions from Tokio Marine Group operations"": 83,483 tons (32% reduction vs
2015)

+ (Scope 1:13,022 tons; Scope 2: 47,435 tons; Scope 3”:

23,026 tons) Amount of GHG(CO2) Fixed and Reduced:130,003 tons
Tokio Marine Group is working to reduce the environmental impact of the overall Group (domestic and
overseas)
and become carbon neutral by 1) conserving energy and using energy more efficiently, 2)
planting mangroves to absorb and fix CO2, 3) using natural energy (such as by procuring green electricity)
and 4) amortizing carbon credits. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2021 we achieved carbon neutrality
for the ninth consecutive year (since fiscal 2013) thanks to absorption and fixation effects of mangrove
planting and the use of carbon credits outperforming the CO2 emissions generated by the Group's overall
business activities. The value of ecosystem services generated through the Mangrove Planting Project over
the past 20 years (from April 1999 to the end of March 2019) has reached approximately 118.5 billion yen.
We expect the value to climb to 391.2 billion yen by the end of fiscal 2038 As of March 31, 2023, we have
planted a total area of 12,261 hectares of mangrove forest.

‘and transitional risks posed.
As climate change is a complex issue that cannot be resolved overnight, Starr International intends to
continue to monitor developments and do its part to address climate change risk in relation to an overall
developing ESG strategy. As the insurance industry’s understanding of the implications of ESG-related
issues and their practical application continues to evolve, Starr International will continue to actively
monitor such matters through its ERM function and individual Board level committees as appropriate. In
2021, Starr International established an ERM Working Group subgroup that is tasked with the
responsibility for addressing ESG risk, including evaluating the overall governance structure of ESG
within Starr International. This subgroup is comprised of representatives from Starr International’s global
operations in key functional areas and is responsible for the documentation of relevant ESG-related
requirements and completion of assessments evaluating exposure to climate change and other related

B, Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business,
strategy, and financial planning. In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities
on the insurer’s business, strategy, and financial planning, insurers should consider including the
following:
The Company has reviewed the potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on its business,
strategy, and financial planning. The Company has determined that climate change does not currently
pose a material underwriting risk for the Company. The most significant potential climate-related risk to
the Company would be in providing property coverage for coastal properties, which could be exposed to
wind and flood. However, the Company’s insurance policies are generally issued with an annual term. In
addition, the Company, through its loss control professionals works with its clients to identify potential
natural catastrophe hazards and recommends ways in which such hazards may be mitigated. Therefore,
the Company will continue to monitor climate change related developments and will consider specific
modifications to the terms, pricing, capacity and availability of such policies when the threats from
coastal flooding or severe weather events become better understood in terms of scope and impact to the
Company. The Company utilizes a sophisticated and insurance industry recognized catastrophe modeling
platform to assist in limiting its financial exposure to loss arising from such severe weather events. This
tool has evolved over time, with various product enhancements incorporating updated factors including
historical catastrophe events. The return periods in the model are five-year forward-looking viewss of
annual hurricane landfall rates, reflecting both historical and projected climate trends over the next five
‘years. Some of the underlying models focus on the relationship between Sea Surface Temperature
(/SST”) and hurricane landfall statistics, with some of these models factoring in human activities to
enhance the predictability of climate changes.
The Company’s principal objectives for its investment portfolios are preservation of capital and liquidity
commensurate with the requirements of the Company’s business operations within formalized and
documented investment guidelines and/or investment management agreements with third-party
investment management advisors. These third party investment management advisors assist with the
management of the Company’s fixed income portfolio and other investments that directly support the
Company's operations and each have unique monitoring capabilities. The Company has not altered its
investment strategy in specific consideration of climate change issues at this time. However, the Company
will continue to monitor climate change related developments and will consider specific modifications to
the investment strategies as the risks associated with climate change become better understood.

b. Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential
physical and transition climate related risks, if applicable.
The Company encourages its policyholders to maintain comprehensive risk management and loss
mitigation programs that are responsive to the policyholder’s assessment of risk. The correlation between
insured loss of the type experienced by the Company’s insureds and climate change influenced events has
not been sufficiently established within the industry to the degree that specific actions can be advocated or
recommended at this time.

a. Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its

investment portfolio, including what investment classes have been considered.

Please see above.
Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. In describing
the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers should consider
including the following:
a. Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how frequently
the process is completed.
The Company models various potential property exposed risk scenarios and evaluates modeled potential
impact to capital. In addition, the Company monitors actual events and makes underwriting adjustments
based on those events.
b. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.

INSURANCE
The Company models on a stochastic and deterministic basis various potential property exposed risk.
c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management.
i, In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management, insurers should consider including the
following:
1. Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-risk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
The Company has incorporated climate change into its ERM disciplines. Senior management of the
Company is engaged in the overall ERM process.
2, Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.
The Company manages its exposure to loss arising from wind, fire, flood and earthquake events by
controlling total aggregate limits of insured risk in various geographical areas. The Company utilizes
sophisticated insurance industry recognized computer modeling to assist in making probable maximum
loss projections under various event scenarios. The Company has not utilized any computer modeling
specifically based on climate change scenarios at this time. However, the modeling tool utilized has
evolved over time, with various product enhancements, incorporating updated factors including historical
catastrophe events, The return periods in the model are five-year forward-looking views of annual
hurricane landfall rates, reflecting both historical and projected climate trends over the next five years.
Some of the underlying models focus on the relationship between SST and hurricane landfall statistics,
with some of these models factoring in human activities to enhance the predictability of climate changes.
The Company will continue to monitor climate change related developments and believes it will be in a
position to address the emergence of climate related risk factors before they present an imminent threat to
the Company’s underwriting and investment strategies.
3. Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.
Please see above.

percentage of capital against tolerance limits.
ii. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the
related risks.
While the Company has not defined these Scopes and related risks at this time, the Company is reviewing
these considerations and plans to evaluate these Scopes and their potential risks and impacts as part of its
climate-related initiatives as part of its broader ESG efforts.
iti, Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
The Company models on a stochastic probable maximum loss basis and deterministic scenarios as

Although State Fund has not yet completed a formal scenario analysis, we consider
limate-related risks and opportunities within the following areas:
investments - State Fund considers climate-related risks in its investment portfolio and
as set 3 ESG goals to reduce financial risk. Two of these are related to climate directly:

in 2022, under the auspices of the Sustainability Council, State Fund identified its
jaterial issues and developed strategic roadmaps for advancing performance and
progress in the management of these issues. Two of these issues, climate resilience and
kocietal health, cover climate-related risks and opportunities. In late 2023, State Fund
btreamlined its sustainability governance structure by sunsetting the Sustainability

nesses from excessive heat and wildfires. As a result, engaging our policyholders has
been a top priority for State Fund since its inception. We have worked to help our
ustomers adapt to climate-related risks. Our health and safety and loss prevention
‘eams have taken steps to address these issues by developing online resources for
identifying and combatting heat and smoke-related illnesses through our Online Safety

niversity at through seminars/webinars that are available to ALL
alifornia employers, including our policyholders, in both English and Spanish. In 2023,
State Fund's more than 300 safety courses, accessible around the clock, had over
282,000 visits and generated over 875,000 page views. Several of these courses provide

strategy is based solely on coverage for ts policyholders and is not impacted by
climate change. To the extent that climate change may mpact the business of our
policyholders, SVMIC relies upon the policyholders themselves to incorporate
climate risks into their strategies, opportunities, and risks. SVMIC provides the
ability,in most cases, to work remotely, which minimizes the related carbon

1. Governance
Stillwater’s management team understands it has a crucial role in assessing and managing
climate-related risks and opportunities. The Company has a strong risk-averse culture
(including climate-related risks) that is continually reinforced by its’ senior leadership.
The Board provides oversight of risks (including climate-related risks) via formal quarterly
meetings and informal conversations on an as-needed basis. At each quarterly meeting the
Board is made aware of climate-related issues via granular discussions around (a) loss reporting
by line of business, by state, by peril, cat vs non-cat, etc. (b) reinsurance renewals, (c) reserve
development analyses and (d) other relevant topics.
2. Strategy
Energy efficiency represents the biggest short-term opportunity for Stillwater to manage
mounting energy cost pressures triggered by current economic and geopolitical forces while
helping to create a more sustainable, affordable, reliable, and secure energy future for all.
‘Advancements in data analytics technology deliver significant cost savings making energy
efficiency one of the fastest and most cost-effective actions to reduce energy costs while
advancing progress towards global climate targets.
The Company has two web-based platforms along with our mobile app to help manage and
reduce emissions in its operations.
Web-based Platform for Agents - The Agent portal on Stillwater.com enables on-line quoting,
policy issuance, endorsements, servicing, billing, and remittance for all independent
agents/business partners. On average, 14,000 agents access our site each month to access the
needed data electronically. in 2024 we introduced a feature where our agents can opt in to
receive email notifications when a policy's status changes to cancellation or non-renewal and
when claim has been opened or closed. To date, 2,000 of our agents have signed up for this
feature which eliminates the need for us to send paper notification to our agents. In addition,
during the quoting process, we make it easy for our partners to encourage policyholders to
register their account and “Go Green” to access their policy documents.
Web-based Platform for Policyholders - The Customer portal on Stillwater.com enables
policyholders to access their generic policy documents electronically via e-Docs (permissible in
24 states) eliminating the requirement for generic policy statements to be mailed. As a result of
this initiative, we have been able to avoid printing an average of 90,000 pages per week. The

use of eDocs also reduces the throughput on our high-speed printers and inserters thereby
reducing energy use, toner, and other associated consumables. We have averaged
approximately 1,370 eDoc views per month in 2024 as of the date of this submission.
Currently, approximately 50% of our policyholders have registered their accounts on our Self-
Service platform, up from 46% last year due to our continued enhancements and proactive
measures to encourage registration. Once an account is registered, policyholders have direct
access to their policies electronically and can view their documents, make a payment, file a
claim, or reach out to our customer service team via chat, email, or phone. To date,
approximately 47% of our policyholders who have registered their account have made at least a
‘one-time payment via our Self-Service platform.
Our Self-Service platform makes it easy for policyholders to choose paperless by simply
changing their preferences in Account Settings. When new documents or notices are available
to view, we email a link to our policyholders so they can view them electronically. As of the
date of this response, paperless was activated for approximately 17% of our total policy count,
and 38% of those who registered on our Self-Service platform.
Mobile App for Policyholders — In the past two years we have had 12,265 downloads of our
mobile app in both Google Play and Apple Stores. Policyholders can view their documents,
make payments and report claims from their mobile devices.
In summary, the two web-based platforms and the mobile app enable the Company to:

(a) reduce the environmental impact of the use of consumables,

(b) maximize the productivity of its Customer Service Representatives,

(c) better control the size of its physical footprint and related environmental impact and

(d) more effectively manage its costs in all these areas.
The Company monitors and manages climate-related events, daily claims reports, loss estimates
in real time utilizing an address scrubbing routine from an outside source for geocoding i.e., to
obtain and maintain census tract and block group, FIPS state and county codes, and
latitude/longitude. The Company's proprietary brush mapping tool — utilized in all 50 states as.
part of our Wildfire control program — has consistently outperformed 3"" party solution
providers. Management reviews mapping and other reports daily and can instantly shut down
areas with a high degree of granularity and precision (down to the neighborhood level) based
on fire, storm or other activity. Such refinements are, of course, made in compliance with
applicable state regulations.
The Company's size (~400 total employees as of the date of this response) is such that all
members of the management team are in daily communication with each other as needed.
Company management is also in close, frequent contact with outside service providers such as
investment managers, reinsurance providers and actuarial service providers.

Climate change risks are evaluated in the Company's ERM plan and risks identified are factored
into the Cat reinsurance modeling and contracts and the Company's DR and BC plans.

This close oversight provides an adequate structure for identifying, discussing and responding to
emerging trends and issues.

The Company's actuaries and cat reinsurance broker consider climate change in the analyses
(eg., catastrophe modeling, reinsurance strategies) they perform for the Company. Company
management discusses climate issues with these providers so they can partner with us to
balance the Company's need to maintain and protect a healthy surplus with its desire to grow at
a sensible rate and remain competitive in the marketplace. As new versions of modeling
software are introduced, comparisons of the old to new versions are reviewed.

3. Risk Management

The Company's online quoting system (FIRST) has built-in underwriting standards and edits to
prevent ineligible business from being written and, as a general business practice, exceptions
are not available. Regional Sales Managers work closely with independent agents to ensure
they understand products, pricing and practices. In addition, Company management assesses
and balances market demand for new products with its intention to manage overall risk
tolerance. Prudent re-insurance strategies are employed to offer products for which there is
demand in the marketplace, but which exceed management's risk tolerance level. Finally, the
Company maintains a strong balance of policyholder surplus reserves in the event of excessive
losses.

Each quarter the Company models its book of business for hurricane, conductive storm, storm
surge, wildfire and earthquake risks. The risks identified are assessed to pinpoint precise
geographic areas (census blocks) most likely exposed and to ascertain the potential impact on
claims (both catastrophic and aggregate losses) and on business interruption (claims processing,
agent services, etc.). Areas identified as having too great a risk can be closed to new business
immediately upon making the determination. The Company believes its HO, Fire and Dwelling
products are most exposed to climate change risk.

Over the last decade, there has been a noteworthy increase in the frequency and severity of
convective storm activity across the central and eastern United States. To address this the
Company began using new modeling software that provides differentiated severe thunderstorm
risk perspectives, hail/wind/tornado hot spots and statistically significant trends in risk over
time. This software has enabled us to better manage our portfolio, facilitate rate making,
support strategic growth and improve risk selection.

In wind-affected states, discounts are offered for mitigation devices/techniques, such as storm
shutters, in addition to pricing incentives for higher deductibles. On fire coverage, peril specific
coverage limits and sub-limits are in place to transfer some of the risks for secondary effects

back to the policyholder. For example, in coastal and other hurricane-prone states
policyholders are sent a “Notice of Premium Discounts for Hurricane Loss Mitigation”, an
“Advisory Notice to Policyholder — Calendar Year Hurricane Deductibles” and a “Special Notice”
about the importance of Flood insurance. Additionally, where permitted, the Company has.
introduced new form changes such as: a reduction in Coverage C limits from 50% to 30% and in
Coverage D limits from 40% to 20%, minimum windstorm/hail deductibles, matching exclusions,
old home and high value home surcharges.

The Company maintains and updates annually both a Business Continuity Plan and a Disaster
Recovery Plan, each of which address resources needed to resume normal operations in the
event of climate related work outage. The Business Continuity Plan addresses emergency
personnel resource requirements, temporary business output outsourcing and
network/technology back-up processes. The Disaster Recovery Plan addresses restoration of
the physical assets utilized in the operation of the business.

The Company utilizes investment managers who factor many issues into their buy/sell decisions
including but not limited to regulatory requirements, liquidity needs, yield, asset allocation,
climate issues. They endeavor to construct an investment portfolio that is responsive to climate
issues, among other factors. To that end, virtually all of the Company's holdings of securities in
the fossil fuel sector were divested in 2016 and 2017. As of the date of this response, the
Company has no holdings in the fossil fuel sector.

Company management believes that future trends in the following areas might deviate
substantially from historical trends: (a) increased losses due to the winds remaining at
hurricane strength for longer periods of time caused by higher sustained heat levels, (b)
increased hurricane and flood related losses due to higher water levels in general, (c) increased
losses from more frequent convective storms caused by higher sustained heat levels and (d)
increase in fire losses caused by sustained change in rain patterns resulting in a damaging
combination of arid conditions that are more susceptible to fires and lower water tables to
combat. These events would increase the Company's exposure to higher losses across all lines
of business, but in particular our Homeowner, Allied Lines, Fire and EQ lines which, for calendar
year 2023, represented approximately 83% of written premium.

As stated above, the Company licenses its own cat modeling software to model the impact of
hurricane, conductive storm, storm surge, wildfire and earthquake activity. The Company also
licenses Arc GIS, sophisticated mapping software, to further model its catastrophic exposure in
concentration.

The Company seeks to mitigate both its catastrophic and aggregate exposure to climate-related
risk with (a) geographic diversification, (b) aggressive rate challenging, (c) transfer of risk to
policy holders via peril-specific exclusions in risk-prone areas and pricing incentives for higher
deductibles, (d) transfer of risk via catastrophic, aggregate, facultative, and quota share
reinsurance, (e) product mix balancing targets and (f) maintenance of a healthy surplus.

Annual renewal of virtually all reinsurance arrangements allows a high degree of flexibility in
adapting to risk management conditions that change over time.

4 Metrics and Targets

As stated above, Stillwater uses catastrophe modeling to measure and manage climate-related
risks. Because the Company's business is primarily homeowners, we model potential losses
from hurricane, earthquake (including fire following), tornado/hail and all perils combined. The
modeling information is used to determine the amount of catastrophe reinsurance needed to
achieve coverage at the 250-year probable maximum loss level.

TCFD-ALIGNED QUESTIONS
UPDATED 2022
GOVERNANCE
1. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
In disclosing the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities insurers should consider
including the following:

* Identify and include any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and opportunities.

* Describe where climate-related disclosure is handled within the insurer’s structure, e.g., at a group level,

entity level, or a combination. If handled at the group level, describe what activities are undertaken at the

company level.

A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and

opportunities.

In describing the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the climate-
related financial risks, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the

climate-related financial risks.

B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Response: Sublimity Insurance Company (SIC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of United Heritage
Financial Group, Inc. (UHFG). Climate-related risks and opportunities are identified, assessed, and
managed by the SIC executive leadership team, working in concert with the UHFG executive
leadership team. Responsibility for and oversight of climate-related financial risk management in SIC
and the overall United Heritage enterprise ultimately rests with the UHFG Board of Directors (BOD),
with specific responsibility delegated to the UHFG BOD Risk Committee. Our current investment
policies are also overseen by the UHFG BOD Investment Committee and provide for broad
diversification and risk mitigation.

As a property and casualty insurance company, climate-related risks and opportunities have an
impact on SIC's insurance risk. The leadership teams periodically assess and manage the
performance of SIC, including the risk and impact of climate-related events. As a result of its risk
management activities, SIC has strategically modified its own reinsurance protection and enhanced
its underwriting guidelines with new tools and measures for underwriting climate-related risks. These
strategies guide SIC to stay within tolerable limits for probable maximum loss, concentration of loss,
and underwriting new business in risk prone areas. Financial results and operational updates are
reviewed with the BOD on a quarterly basis. SIC does not have a specific climate change policy.
STRATEGY

2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's

businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.

In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s businesses,
strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and

resiliency. *

* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its operations
or organizations. *
A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium,
and long term.
In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium, and
longer term, insurers should consider including the following:
* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short term, 5-10 years as
medium term, and 10-30 years as long term.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and
financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and financial
planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low
carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
Response: SIC's business is concentrated in Idaho, Oregon, and Utah. Thus, climate-related risks
and opportunities directly impact SIC’s insurance risk. Wildfire and severe convective storm (SCS)
risks are the primary climate-related risks that SIC actively monitors and manages. These risks
continue to present the largest climate-related risk over the short, medium, and long term.
Management periodically identifies and assesses the impact of these climate-related events.
Climate-related initiatives are part of the United Heritage’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
program that incorporates Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks. Due to the rise in
frequency and severity of catastrophic (CAT) wildfire and SCS events SIC has strategically modified
its own reinsurance protection to provide financial resilience in a CAT event scenario. Strategic use
of reinsurance protection has significantly changed in recent years to address climate related CAT
event losses. SIC also has new, enhanced tools to measure the increased risk of wildfire and SCS
losses in its underwriting, pricing, and concentration guidelines.
SIC's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and good faith efforts to transition to a low-carbon
economy include encouragement of recycling (including paper, plastic, furniture and office equipment
products) and offering hybrid and fully remote work schedules.
SIC has been negatively impacted by CAT losses from both wildfire and SCS events over the last
five years. Its reinsurance programs and underwriting measures have supported the financial
resilience to endure the rising severity of loss. Reinsurance protection also is a rising cost, and
further adjustments may be necessary. SIC has not specifically taken into consideration a 2 degree
Celsius or lower scenario. SIC does not provide insurance products or services that support the
transition to a low carbon economy or help customers adapt to climate-related risk. SIC has not
formally identified any short-, medium-, or long-term climate-related risks or opportunities.
RISK MANAGEMENT
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers
should consider including the following:

* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting portfolio, and
how the company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to physical, transition and liability
risk. *
* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential physical
and transition climate related risks, if applicable. *
* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment portfolio,
including what investment classes have been considered. *
A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers should consider
including the following:
* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how frequently
the process is completed. *
B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into
the insurer's overall risk management.
In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the
insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-risk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.
Response: SIC periodically assesses and manages the impact of climate-related events on the
business. Any key risks that impact the business are identified, assessed, and managed through the
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework and brought before the UHFG BOD Risk Committee
on an as-identified basis.
The ERM framework, facilitated by the UHFG's Chief Risk Officer, has a consistent taxonomy to
identify, assess, and manage strategic, financial, operational, technology, governance and
compliance risks. As risks are identified, they are assessed for defined levels of impact, probability,
velocity, and related controls to ensure the company is within the tolerable risk appetite. Based on
the results of these measurements, resources are prioritized and applied to address those risks to
bring them within appropriate tolerance levels. As with all risks and their resulting risk response,
ongoing monitoring is in place to ascertain residual risk and the necessity for additional action.
Wildfire and SCS risks are the primary climate-related risks that SIC actively monitors and manages
within its underwriting portfolio. SIC uses two different wildfire risk assessment tools to get varying
views of wildfire exposure based on the two different models, and we have underwriting guidelines in
place related to the risk scores returned. SIC also works directly with its reinsurance partners to
model and analyze probable loss scenarios due to wildfire, SCS, and other CAT events based on
data such as wind, weather, fuel, slope, and geography. Utilizing this information SIC measures its
tolerable limits for new business and concentration of business that may be impacted by such events
during an annual period.

As the frequency and severity of wildfire events has occurred, SIC has changed its underwriting
appetite to only accept low wildfire risk scores and to reduce its concentration of wildfire exposed
business in high-risk areas according to the wildfire risk assessment tools. This allows SIC to
manage its tolerable risk under its reinsurance programs also.
SIC encourages homeowners to create defensible space around their properties to help mitigate
losses from wildfire and falling trees in SCS events. SIC staff call policyholders during active wildfire
activity to help them prepare with watering their property, moving animals, and evacuation if
necessary.
SIC has not performed a detailed climate scenario analysis on its investment portfolio in an attempt
to quantify climate-related risks. Measurable ESG ratings for investments are still in their infancy and
there are currently no standardized ratings that can be used to accurately determine ESG exposure.
Our current investment policies, overseen by the UHFG BOD Investment Committee, provide for
broad diversification and risk management.
METRICS AND TARGETS
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your business.
Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to assess, if any.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:
+ In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate
scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount
of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related
risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
Response: SIC measures the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities primarily though
analysis of Probable Maximum Losses and catastrophe modeling for reinsurance.
Our reinsurance broker assists with the catastrophe modeling of our portfolio for the perils of
earthquake (including fire following), SCS, and wildfire using the AIR model and the RMS model
(wildfire not included in RMS). The model results inform our decisions on the purchase of
reinsurance to provide financial resilience in a CAT event scenario. Strategic use of reinsurance
protection has significantly changed in recent years to address climate related CAT event losses.
SIC also has new, enhanced tools to measure the increased risk of wildfire and SCS losses in its
underwriting, pricing, and concentration guidelines. The AIR wildfire model is also used to produce a

risk aggregation score that combines wildfire risk with policy aggregation to help inform underwriting
decisions and manage aggregation in areas exposed to wildfire risk.

For the individual perils in the catastrophe models, as well as all perils combined, the models provide
Probable Maximum Losses at several return periods varying from 1:5 years to 1:10,000 years along
with average annual losses. These results are reviewed annually as a measure of how our risk may
be changing over time. Actual losses experienced from any of these perils are also tracked and
measured in relation to non-climate-related perils.

SIC has not formally identified SIC’s greenhouse gas emissions. SIC's output is minor as it has one
building and 2 vehicles. We comply with all local and state required guidance on emissions, including
all clean building standards.

Response for
Governance:
Climate Risk Governance is handled on an entity level basis by the Board of Directors and
the Investment and Enterprise Risk Management committee both of which meet on a
quarterly basis. The Board of Directors is comprised of financial and insurance
professionals that are knowledgeable on the topic of Climate Risk as it relates to risks
and opportunities. The Investment and Enterprise Risk Management Committee is
comprised of senior level Sutton employees as well as representatives from the Board of
Directors (including independent directors). One of the principal functions of the
Investment and Enterprise Risk Management Committee is to review investment risk
management exposures, including climate risks and opportunities. In addition, the
Company's Underwriting Committee comprised of senior team members meets weekly
and includes discussions on climate risk topics, as necessary. The Company also has an
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policy statement that addresses Climate
Risk.
Strategy:
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and
opportunities on the insurer's businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such

+ Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to
a low carbon economy.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration
different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
Response for
Strategy: The Company recognizes that Climate Risk has the potential to impact the Company and

stakeholders (including employees and policyholders) from insured loss events that could
affect the ongoing operations of the Company. As a result, the Company has taken a
number of steps embedded in the decision-making process to mitigate Climate Risk.
Scorecards that consider Climate Risk components are utilized to evaluate new business
opportunities and the associated business partners. From an environmental perspective,
material changes in climate risk are identified and measured. The Company employs
catastrophe models to assess climate risk from both a short-term and long-term

perspective. Risk appetite statements dictate the amount of risk the Company is willing
to assume from catastrophic events. The Company maintains an Investment Policy
overseen by the Investment and Enterprise Risk Management Committee. However, the
Company does not have any energy-related investments and does not intend to make
any energy-related investments. While the Company also offers products that provide
consumers access to property insurance in underserved markets such as catastrophe
prone areas with insurance availability issues, the Company is aware of the potential
impact of changes in temperature on events that include flooding, tropical cyclones, and
wildfires. The Company also maintains a work-at-home arrangement for over 90% of
employees and utilizes virtual meetings, reducing its carbon footprint.

Response for

Risk ‘The Company employs a dedicated CRO to oversee the Enterprise Risk Management

Management: Department and prepare a risk register. The risk register contains more than 50 risks
including Climate Risk. Each risk is ranked quarterly to identify elevated risks and
appropriate mitigants. Each quarter, the risk register is prepared by the CRO with input
from the management team, presented to the Investment and Enterprise Risk
Management Committee for review and discussion, and ultimately shared with the Board.
From a physical risk perspective, Climate Risk is mitigated by maintaining a portfolio that
is highly diversified both geographically and by product. The Company utilizes scenario
analysis which includes forward looks at historical events, realistic disaster scenarios,
stress testing and reverse stress testing. Transition risk is governed by the Investment
Policy and the Investment Committee which reports changes in the investment portfolio.
However, the Company does not have any energy-related investments and does not
intend to make any energy-related investments. Liability risk is mitigated through
minimal use of a physical office as employees are almost entirely remote. The Company
has risk appetite, tolerance, and limit statements as well as a business continuity plan.

Targets: 4, Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant
collateralized risks and opportunities where such information is material.

Metrics and cyclone activity with an increase in Cat 3’s and higher, rising sea levels (1 foot over next
Targets: 25 years) and flooding/higher storm surge, heavier rainfall as the atmosphere holds more
moisture, and an increase in wildfires. To assess this, the Company makes extensive use
of catastrophe modeling. Perils modeled include hurricane, flood, severe convective
storm, wildfire, and winter storm. The Company relies on two models (AIR Touchstone
and Risk Management Solutions) to evaluate risk. The overall all peril modeling is limited
to 5% of surplus at the 1 in 250; however, the Company currently purchases reinsurance
excess of the 300-year return period on an individual peril basis. In addition, the
Company further monitors and reacts to Climate Risk through aggregation management
utilizing Spatial Key Software.

To the Board of Directors of Swiss Re Ltd, Zurich
We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on Swiss Re Lic's hereinafter ""Swiss Re"") Sustainabilly
Report 2023 for the year ended 31 December 2023 (hereinafter ""Sustainabilly Report 2023"")
(Our assurance engagement does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or future looking information

(or any images, audio les or embedded videos.
Understanding how Swiss Re has Prepared the Sustainability Report 2023,
‘Swiss Re prepared the Sustainability Report 2023 using the following criteria (hereinafter referred to as the
""Sustainability Reporting Criteria’)
For the sections referenced within the Swiss CO: reference table on pages 122-123 - Article 964b of the
‘Swiss Code of Obligations and Swiss Re internally developed criteria as described within the Sustainability
Report 2023;
For greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported on pages 111-113 - Greenhouse Gas Protocol;
For insurance-associated emissions reported on page 108 - Global GHG Accounting & Reporting Standard
Part C by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials;
For Green, social and sustainablity bonds reported on page 109 - International Capital Market Association
(ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBP) and Social Bond Principles (SBP);
For all remaining sections not mentioned above - Swiss Re internally developed erteria as described within
the Sustainabiity Report 2023,
Consequently, the Sustainability Report 2023 needs o be read and understood together with these criteria. We believe
that these criteria are a suitable basis for our limited assurance engagement.
‘ur Limited Assurance Conclusion
‘Based on the procedures we have performed as described under the ‘Summary of the work we performed as the
basis for our assurance conclusion’ and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that
‘causes us to beliave that the Sustainability Report 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
the Sustainability Reporting Criteria,
We do not express an assurance conclusion on information in respect of earlier periods or future looking information
Included in the Sustainability Report 2023, information included in the Financial Report 2023, information included in
the Business Report 2023 or liked to from the Sustainability Report 2023 or from the Financial Report 2023 or from
the Business Report 2023, including any images, audio files or embedded videos. Our conclusion does not extend
to the requirements of Swiss Code of Obligation article 964 (A),
Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Sustainability Report 2023
‘Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure itis possible that errors or iregularities may occur in
disclosures in the Sustainability Report 2023 and not be detected. Qur engagement is not designed to detect all
Internal control weaknesses in the preparation ofthe Sustainability Report 2023 because the engagement was not
pperformed on a continuous basis throughout the period and the audit procedures performed were on a test basis.

‘Summary of the Work we Performed as the Basis for our Assurance Conclusion
‘We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material
misstatement of the Sustainabilty Report 2023 is likely to arise. The procedures we performed were based on our
professional judgment. Carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Sustainability Report 2023 included,
among others:
‘Assessment of the design and implementation of systems, processes and internal controls for
determining, processing and monitoring sustainabilty performance data, including the consolidation of
ata;
Inquiries of employees responsible fr the determination and consolidation as well as the
implementation of intemal control procedures regarding the selected disclosures;
Inspection of selacted internal and external documents to determine whether quantitative and
qualitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced
Assessment of the data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliably of the
reported data on a test basis and through testing of selected calculations;
‘Analytical assessment of the data and trends of the quantitative disclosures;
Checking thatthe Sustainability Report 2023 contains the information required by article 964b(1) and
(2) to understand the business performance, the business results, the state ofthe undertaking and the
effects ofits activity on environmental matters, social issues, employee-related issues, respect for
human rights and combating corruption.
‘The procedures performed ina limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent
than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently the level of assurance obtained ina limited assurance
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a
reasonable assurance engagement.

To the Board of Directors of Swiss Re Ltd, Zurich
We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on Swiss Re Lic's hereinafter ""Swiss Re"") Sustainabilly
Report 2023 for the year ended 31 December 2023 (hereinafter ""Sustainabilly Report 2023"")
(Our assurance engagement does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or future looking information

(or any images, audio les or embedded videos.
Understanding how Swiss Re has Prepared the Sustainability Report 2023,
‘Swiss Re prepared the Sustainability Report 2023 using the following criteria (hereinafter referred to as the
""Sustainability Reporting Criteria’)
For the sections referenced within the Swiss CO: reference table on pages 122-123 - Article 964b of the
‘Swiss Code of Obligations and Swiss Re internally developed criteria as described within the Sustainability
Report 2023;
For greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported on pages 111-113 - Greenhouse Gas Protocol;
For insurance-associated emissions reported on page 108 - Global GHG Accounting & Reporting Standard
Part C by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials;
For Green, social and sustainablity bonds reported on page 109 - International Capital Market Association
(ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBP) and Social Bond Principles (SBP);
For all remaining sections not mentioned above - Swiss Re internally developed erteria as described within
the Sustainabiity Report 2023,
Consequently, the Sustainability Report 2023 needs o be read and understood together with these criteria. We believe
that these criteria are a suitable basis for our limited assurance engagement.
‘ur Limited Assurance Conclusion
‘Based on the procedures we have performed as described under the ‘Summary of the work we performed as the
basis for our assurance conclusion’ and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that
‘causes us to beliave that the Sustainability Report 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
the Sustainability Reporting Criteria,
We do not express an assurance conclusion on information in respect of earlier periods or future looking information
Included in the Sustainability Report 2023, information included in the Financial Report 2023, information included in
the Business Report 2023 or liked to from the Sustainability Report 2023 or from the Financial Report 2023 or from
the Business Report 2023, including any images, audio files or embedded videos. Our conclusion does not extend
to the requirements of Swiss Code of Obligation article 964 (A),
Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Sustainability Report 2023
‘Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure itis possible that errors or iregularities may occur in
disclosures in the Sustainability Report 2023 and not be detected. Qur engagement is not designed to detect all
Internal control weaknesses in the preparation ofthe Sustainability Report 2023 because the engagement was not
pperformed on a continuous basis throughout the period and the audit procedures performed were on a test basis.

‘Summary of the Work we Performed as the Basis for our Assurance Conclusion
‘We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material
misstatement of the Sustainabilty Report 2023 is likely to arise. The procedures we performed were based on our
professional judgment. Carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Sustainability Report 2023 included,
among others:
‘Assessment of the design and implementation of systems, processes and internal controls for
determining, processing and monitoring sustainabilty performance data, including the consolidation of

Inquiries of employees responsible fr the determination and consolidation as well as the
implementation of intemal control procedures regarding the selected disclosures;

effects ofits activity on environmental matters, social issues, employee-related issues, respect for
human rights and combating corruption.
‘The procedures performed ina limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent

Insurance Company and its affiliates, including Talcott Resolution Life and Annuity
Insurance Company, (""Talcott Resolution”) have treated Environmental, Social,
Governance (ESG) issues as a Core Risk to the Company since 2021. In 2023, the
Enterprise Risk Governance Working Group (ERGWG), an executive management level
Committee, had oversight of all operational risks and provided executive oversight of
climate-related risks.
As a Core Risk, ESG related risks were addressed through the ESG Committee, which
includes participants from each functional area who were nominated by an executive
leader. In 2023, the ESG Committee reported its progress quarterly to the ERGWG. One
of the goals of the ESG Committee is to provide insight into climate-related risks, identity
needed policies to address all ESG risks including climate-related risks, inform the
ERGWG on current actions taken relating to ESG and climate-related risks, and discuss
how future ESG and climate-related risks may have the potential to impact Talcott
Resolution.
In addition to the oversight provide by the ERGWG, Talcott Resolution’s Board of
Directors has designated the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) as being responsible for the
Board-level oversight of the Company's management of the financial risks from climate
change. The Board has also designated the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) as being the
senior leader responsible for the management of the financial risks from climate
change. Also, Talcott Resolution reports on the actions taken to address climate-related
risks in the ESG section of the Company's annual Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA)
In addition, the ESG Committee drafted an ESG policy that addresses the financial risks
related to climate change which was adopted by Talcott's enterprise Board. These
designations, disclosures, and the policy follow the Connecticut Insurance Department
Bulletin FS-44""Guidance for Connecticut Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial
Risks for Climate Change.”
Strategy - narrative
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and
opportunities on the insurer's businesses, strategy, and financial planning where
such information is material.
In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities
on the insurer's businesses, strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider
including the following:
+ Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the
topic of climate risk and resiliency.
+ Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas
emissions in its operations or organizations.

A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified
cover the short, medium, and long term.
In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over
the short, medium, and longer term, insurers should consider including the following:

+ Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short term, 5-10

years as medium term, and 10-30 years as long term.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
business, strategy, and financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
business, strategy, and financial planning, insurers should consider including the
following:

* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the
transition to a low carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related
risk.

* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low
carbon economy.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer’s strategy, taking into consideration

different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower

scenario.
Talcott Resolution Life and Annuity Insurance Company: As a life insurance and annuity
company, some of the impacts of climate-related risks are not material to the business,
strategy, or financial planning of Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company and its
affiliates, including Talcott Resolution Life and Annuity Insurance Company, (“Talcott
Resolution""). However, Talcott Resolution is actively working toward reducing the
company’s environmental impact.
An environmentally focused employee interest group influences a culture of
sustainability, educates employees to do the same at work and in their communities,
and volunteers on green projects in the local community.
Talcott Resolution has efforts in place to reduce the printed materials received by our
policyholders, including offering the opportunity to opt-in to e-Delivery for most
documents. Currently, 14% of policyholders are enrolled and a 2023 project is intended
to improve the process and to increase enrollment. Following the SEC rules 30e-3 and
498a, Talcott Resolution is reducing the size and volume of shareholder reports and
prospectuses. Also, the company is suppressing paper statements in quarters when no
financial activity has occurred, suppressing confirmations for each individual systematic
transaction to instead list those transactions on a quarterly statement, and suppressing
broker copies of most client output. Talcott Resolution also encourages electronic funds
transfers (EFTs), in place of receiving paper checks, and recently began to offer digital

beneficiary changes in place of paper forms. These efforts save over 138 million pieces
of paper annually.
Furthermore, Talcott Resolution considers Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
issues, including climate-related risks, as part of its overall credit evaluation of current
and potential investments.
The ESG Committee is in the process of identifying current actions taken relating to
financial risks related to climate change, as well as future potential actions related to
climate-related risk. In compliance with Connecticut Insurance Department Bulletin FS-
44 “Guidance for Connecticut Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks for
Climate Change.” the ESG Committee partnered with the Investment team to conduct
an annual climate risk materiality assessment of Talcott's Investment portfolio. In
combination with the ESG Committee's qualitative assessment, the ERGWG determined
that climate risk is not currently material for Talcott Resolution for 2023.
Talcott Resolution's business is primarily life and annuity products with similar exposure to
longevity and mortality risk. Therefore, events resulting from climate change that could
impact these core offsetting risks - including extreme weather, natural disasters,
wildfires, and even an increased spread of airborne infectious disease - are not
considered significant risk exposures for Talcott Resolution.
Talcott Resolution does have a responsibility to employees, policyholders, regulators,
and other business counterparties when a business disruption event occurs (or
potentially occurs). To ensure potential disaster scenarios do not impair our ability to
meet these responsibilities, Talcott Resolution invokes a well-understood and practiced
set of business resiliency protocols designed to support our critical business functions
until the company is able to resume “business as usual.”
Talcott Resolution’s primary recovery strategy of its business continuity plans (BCP) is
remote access for all employees. In addition, the Talcott Resolution BCPs also contain
detailed plans for: loss of facility, loss of staff, loss of critical technology, and loss of
critical vendor.
Talcott Resolution does not specifically calculate climate scenarios as part of its
strategy. However, Talcott Resolution understands that climate-related risks can lead to
potential business resiliency concerns.

Talcott Resolution Life and Annuity Insurance Company: Talcott Resolution Life
Insurance Company and its affiliates, including Talcott Resolution Life and Annuity
Insurance Company, (""Talcott Resolution”) have treated Environmental, Social,
Governance (ESG) issues as a Core Risk to the Company since 2021and an ESG
committee was created with executive leaders identifying employee(s} to participate
in the committee. In 2023, the ESG committee reported its progress quarterly to the
Enterprise Risk Governance Working Group (ERGWG). One of the goals of the
committee is to specifically provide additional insight into climate-related risks and how
climate-related risks have the potential to impact Talcott Resolution,

The ESG Committee is in the process of identifying current actions taken relating to
financial risks related to climate change, as well as future potential actions related to
climate-related risk. In compliance with Connecticut Insurance Department Bulletin FS-
44 “Guidance for Connecticut Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks for
Climate Change,” the ESG Committee partners with the Investment team to conduct a
quarterly climate risk materiality assessment of Talcott’s Investment portfolio. In
combination with the ESG Committee's qualitative assessment, the ERGWG determined
that climate risk is not material for Talcott Resolution as of December 31, 2023.

As part of Talcott Resolution's enterprise risk management framework, emerging risks like
climate-related risks are tracked to understand how these risks can impact Talcott
Resolution's capital and surplus. Annually, Talcott Resolution compiles emerging risk
data obtained through management discussion groups and industry survey reviews and
leads risk committee discussions to prioritize the emerging risks that should be focused
on over the coming year. Talcott Resolution identifies top emerging risks based on
industry and management responses and potential financial impact to the
organization. These top emerging risks are presented to our most senior risk committee
and the committee decides if any actions need to be taken.

Talcott Resolution conducts a quarterly climate risk materiality assessment of Talcott’s
Investment portfolio. In evaluating our investment holdings, we have determined that
risks posed by climate change considerations were not material as of December 31,
2023. To mature the materiality assessment, we continually monitor these risks and
adjust the portfolio as these risks continue to emerge.

Outside of any risks emerging from our investment portfolio, Talcott Resolution does not
have significant exposure to climate-related risks, thus Talcott Resolution's liquidity and
capital needs were not impacted by climate change in 2023. In order to monitor
Talcott Resolution’s liquidity needs, the company ran monthly liquidity stresses to ensure
that Talcott Resolution has sufficient cash and liquid assets to fund potential cash
needs.

Talcott Resolution's General Account and Separate Account Guaranteed investment
portfolios are managed predominantly by third-party investment advisors, with robust
oversight by Talcott Resolution’s Investment and Enterprise Risk Management
departments. Talcott Resolution and its investment advisors share similar views with
respect to the many risks, challenges, and opportunities presented by climate change.
Talcott Resolution has incorporated, in a repeatable manner, Environmental attributes
into the investment analysis and strives to incorporate Social and Governance
attributes as the Company matures its materiality assessment to provide a more
complete assessment of the risks associated with each investment.

While such ESG attributes are important, they are just some of many factors analyzed
when assessing the relative attractiveness of an investment for Talcott Resolution’s
portfolios. The challenges and opportunities presented by climate-related risks are
complex, volatile, and hard to predict. As such, Talcott Resolution strives to ensure that
the investment portfolios which support our future policyholder liabilities are prudently
managed and highly diversified by asset class, industry, geography, and duration.

Talcott Resolution believes this approach to investment management enables us to
best navigate the future impact of climate change.

In 2023, the Company formed a dedicated ESG Forum (‘the Forum’) to reflect the Company's broader
focus on ESG policies, processes and disclosures, with a direct reporting line to the Executive Committee
and Board of Directors. The Climate Council, a subcommittee of the Forum, is designed to review and
manage climate-related risks and opportunities throughout the business and associated with strategy,
financial planning, underwriting and investment decisions and product development. The cross-functional
membership of the Forum and Climate Council helps embed ESG goals, objectives, and initiatives into the
strategy and operations of the Company. The members of the Forum and Climate Council represent a
myriad of business functions, including Actuarial, Risk, DEI&B, Human Resources, AmTrust International,
Governance and Regulatory Counsel, Legal Counsel, Investments, Operations, Commercial P&C,
Specialty Risk, Compliance, Treasury, Underwriting, Real Estate, and Exposure Management.
At the March 2024 meeting of the Company's Board of Directors, the Chief People & Communications
Officer (""CP&CO"") reporting on the significant development of the Company's first annual sustainability
report (""Business & Sustainability Review"") and then shared the report with the Company's Board of
Directors several weeks later. The Company is also working with a third-party to track baseline Scope 1
and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is developing metrics to establish a benchmark for the
‘Company.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Company's Enterprise Risk Management (""ERM"") function is responsible for monitoring climate-related
risks that impact the Company's insurance business. The Company's Global CRO provides the Company's
Audit Committee with an ERM report each quarter, a portion of which is dedicated to climate risks. A climate
change financial stress is considered in AmTrust's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) summary
reports annually.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment as it relates to natural catastrophe risks is in place
and embedded in ERM. The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee, which identifies new and
changing risks to the business.
Within the quarterly ERM report, risks are identified by category (e.g., financial, operational, strategic,
external and insurance) and sub-category (market, credit, liquidity, etc.) At the business unit level, the risk
management process consists of, but is not limited to, stakeholder discussions with key executives and risk
‘owners, examinations of risk state by risk category, reviews of design and control effectiveness test results,
where deemed necessary. AmTrust’s ERM team members continue to gain skills and knowledge for
assessing and managing climate risks by attending training events, industry events and other forums. The
ERM team uses data from the scientific community and resources provided by the TCFD guidance to advise
the ERM team and keep up to date of potential consequences or opportunities of climate-related impacts.
Two Board members, one of whom is responsible for the oversight of the Company's management of
climate risks, are members of the Company's management Risk Committee and attend the Company's
Audit Committee meetings. The Audit Committee, supported by Intemal Audit, provides independent
assurance on the design and effectiveness of the overall system of intemal control, including risk
management and compliance. Internal Audit is independent of both the business and the ERM function
and reports directly to the Audit Committee

A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
‘medium, and long term.
‘AmTrust is a commercial property and casualty insurance group that focuses on small businesses. The
‘Company provides workers’ compensation coverage and other commercial coverages for small and
medium-sized businesses. The businesses AmTrust insures include restaurants, retail stores, small
artisan contractors and medical and professional offices. The Company also provides coverage to
apartment buildings, condominiums, and hotels. Even though AmTrust is the third largest workers’
‘compensation insurer in the U.S., 96% of its workers’ compensation policies have annual premiums that
are less than $25,000. The Company's other commercial property and casualty lines also target smaller
businesses.
‘AmTrust also is one of the leading warranty insurers in the U.S. The Company provides the insurance
backstop for auto warranties issued by manufacturers and other warranty providers. The Company also
insures warranties on consumer products offered by many leading brands. These products protect tens
of thousands of consumers. The Company does not insure big businesses or high hazard industries.
The Company has identified five core climate-related risk categories by leveraging guidance provided by
independent experts, regulators and the Company's own assessment of which categories are most likely
to elicit a better understanding of the financial risks facing the Company. Within each core risk category,
material risk factors were identified over various time horizons.
Five core climate-related risk categories identified are as follows:
1. Physical Risks
‘+ Description: immediate risks arising from weather-related events and slow onset climate
changes
ee! =;

+ Examples:
i. Risks associated with increased claims activity and reserve strengthening across
the various lines of business
1. Short- to long-term: severe storms (Property) and other weather events
(Warranty)
2. Long-term: increasing sea level (Property)
ji, Short- to long-term: extreme weather events may disrupt business continuity by
negatively impacting AmTrust carriers’ infrastructure and systems
2. Investment Risks
‘+ Description: risks arising from the exposure to market value deterioration of investments
driven by a current or expected impact of behavior relating to climate change

i. Short-term: material and unforeseen drop in the value of an investment
holdings resulting from the perception that the issuer will be negatively
impacted by climate change related events or market activity

ji, Long-term: loss of market confidence in issuer to adapt business model to
address climate change related events or market demands

3. Transition Risks
‘+ Description: financial risks arising from the transition to a lower-carbon economy
including changes to policies, regulations and public perception
+ Examples:

i. Medium- to long-term: lower demand for current product offering distributed
through traditional methods, including auto warranty and the shift away from.
diesel and gas fuel sources

ji, Medium to long-term: lower demand for consumer electronics and major
appliances that do not comply with the market's perception of meeting
adequate environmental standards

iii, Medium- and long-term: introduction of new technologies which render
products currently offered (or insured) by AmTrust as obsolete, requiring a shift
to new products and distribution channels

iv. Medium-term: new policies and regulations that restrict products that are
included in AmTrust's business plan

4. Liability (Litigation) Risks
‘+ Description: risks of actions initiated by claimants who have suffered loss and damage
arising from climate change
+ Examples:

i. Short to medium-term: business partners (including reinsurance
counterparties) introducing strict climate-related minimum standards which
may be onerous

ji, Medium- to long-term: Climate litigation against AmTrust itself or its
policyholders, specifically those covered by its Professional Indemnity and or
any Director & Officer (""D&O"") Insurance policies for failing to avoid or
minimize adverse impacts on the climate, or failing to adapt to climate change

5. Reputational Risks
‘+ Description: risks of negative publicity resulting from support (i.e. investment, partnership,
etc.) in organizations that are seen to exacerbate climate change or perceived inaction by
AmTrust to reverse its practices that are seen to contribute to climate change
+ Examples:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024

i. Short- to medium-term: Regulatory — Increased scrutiny by regulators as a
result of a real or perceived unmitigated exposure to climate related risks
including those mentioned in the other risk categories

ji, Short- to medium-term: Market confidence — the insurance market (agents,
brokers and policyholders) losing faith in AmTrust due to a real or perceived
unmitigated exposure to climate related risks including those highlighted in the
other risk categories

iii, Short- to medium-term: Rating agencies and other third parties losing faith in
AmTrust's abilty to effectively manage climate change related risks

iv. Medium- to long-term: Losing market share due to an increased desire to work
with companies that take public and proactive steps to combat the causes of
climate change. Given the power of social media, the impact of this risk could
be both rapid and substantial.

v. Short. to medium-term: Talent management — difficulty attracting and retaining
employees due to the Company's negative impact on climate.

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business,

strategy, and financial planning.

‘Two specific areas are being prioritized as they present more risk to AmTrust based on its current strategic

and financial position.

1. Property Insurance: While each line of business AmTrust underwrites is vulnerable to various risk
factors arising from the changing climate, Property insurance is currently seen as the most likely to
experience negative impacts as a result of rising sea levels or changing weather patterns. As described
below in Section C, AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such
as hurricanes, storm surge, inland flooding or wildfires. AmTrust manages its exposure to adverse
weather risks through disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control and
risk transfer. AmTrust's property segment is a small part of its insured portfolio overall
Climate-related losses have not been a material threat to the Company's solvency. AmTrust has a
relatively low exposure to severe weather and catastrophe-type insurance events. AmTrust's insurance
contracts renew annually, which would enable a quick response to changes, as needed, by adjusting
pricing or by restricting exposure.

2. Investment Value Deterioration: AmTrust maintains conservative and diversified investment portfolios

but the market impacts of climate change to companies in which AmTrust invests is difficult to anticipate
and could lead to deteriorations in the valuation of related investment holdings.
The Company has analyzed its investment portfolio to determine what its concentration in fossil fuels
and other carbon-related holdings. The Company's fossil fuel investments comprise less than 10% of
its overall investment portfolio, which is mainly comprised of readily marketable invest ment-grade fixed-
income securities with relatively short duration. As such, climate change risk on the Company's
investment portfolio is currently low due to any impact taking place over a longer time horizon than the
average duration of the portfolio. The Company's corporate bond portfolio is well diversified by sector
and issuer and the impact of climate change, if any, on the creditworthiness of any issuer is insignificant
in the context of the whole portfolio. The Company believes climate risk is tempered by a relatively
short duration portfolio comprised of diverse issuers, which allows the Company to react and reposition
quickly to emerging climate risks.

The Company has taken steps to engage its key constituencies, including policyholders, agents and other

partnerships, on the topic of climate risk and resiliency.

ee! =:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
AmTrust proactively encourages its policyholders to reduce the potential losses caused by climate
influenced events through methods such as:

‘+ Utilization of AmTrust’s highly knowledgeable producer base to provide policyholder education
and guidance on purchasing appropriate coverages needed to mitigate specific risk exposures.

‘+ Policyholder notifications providing loss mitigation strategies and notices for ascertaining
coverage for certain catastrophic coverage through other Federal programs, such as flood
insurance.

+ AmTrust provides online news releases, videos and links to important resources, e.g.
disastersafety.org and Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety...all aimed at proactively
educating and training its customers on potential risk hazards and exposures along with mitigation
analysis, tips and solutions for flood, wind, winter weather, including top convective events

‘+ AmTrust provides Loss Control services that identify various exposures to its policyholders’
property and their ability to produce income that include means of mitigating weather related
losses induced by climate change.

In addition, the Company has ongoing partnerships to support its commitment to appropriately managing
environmental risks.

‘+ Partnered with a third-party to create industry first electric VSC (vehicle service contract) covering
batteries, and have partnered with various other administrators to expand AmTrust's green
footprint.

‘+ Developed and launched service contract program for electric vehicle residential charging station.

‘+ Ongoing research for whole home green infrastructure offerings to bundle coverage for electric
vehicles, at-home charging stations, solar panels, and electricity storage units.

+ AmTrust Title's energy division is dedicated to supporting the growth of clean energy initiatives by
partnering with developers, investors, and lending partners to navigate the unique challenges of
energy project goals. AmTrust's range of energy projects includes wind and solar farms, battery
storage, hydroelectric, hydrogen, liquid nitrogen gas, renewable natural gas, and transmission
lines.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-
related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

Property Insurance -

As the potential for property damage increases because of the changing climate, itis critical to maintain a
strong understanding of the myriad of factors that impact the assessment of properties within AmTrust's
portfolio. The mitigants, as outlined below, explain further the Company's steps to reduce the negative
effects of major catastrophic events.

Mitigants:

‘+ AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such as hurricanes,
storm surge, inland flooding or wildfires. The Company manages its exposure to adverse weather
risks through disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control, and risk
transfer.

‘+ AmTrust considers extreme weather events in pricing and underwriting its insurance products. To
determine the premium associated with the costs of these extreme events the Company relies on
historical storm data, as well as utilizing catastrophe models to supplement this historical data due
to the infrequent nature of extreme weather events

+ ERM’s Exposure Management Team has been regularly performing detailed analysis over the
property and workers’ compensation insurance portfolios for AmTrust as a whole. On a quarterly
basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models.
Hurricane modelled results are based on warm sea surface temperatures catalogues, which
recognize the near/medium term view on sea-surface temperatures, thereby capturing recent
trends. AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year
catastrophe probable maximum loss (""PML"") be protected by reinsurance purchases for property.

ee! =:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
The modelled 1:250-year catastrophe PML for property and workers’ compensation are monitored
against approved risk appetites. In addition, the Company runs Lloyd's Realistic Disaster
‘Scenarios to estimate the potential losses incurred from a variety of hypothetical disaster scenarios,
using consistent and appropriate methods and assumptions.

‘+ AmTrust’s property insurance portfolio is protected by AmTrust's property catastrophe excess of
loss treaty attaching at $70m.

‘+ Climate change financial stress is considered in the Company's ORSA report. The hurricane
exceedance probability curve was adjusted to reflect climate change by increasing the frequency
of hurricane Category 3 events by 15%, Category 4 events by 25%, Category 5 events by 35%,
and increasing storm surge ground up losses by 35%. The post-stress Universal Best's Capital
‘Adequacy Ratio (""BCAR’) is used to assess capital adequacy on a group level. The group's capital
risk appetite is to maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99"" percentile, which
results in a BCAR assessment of “Adequate”. The resulting net loss as measured by the 1:200-
year PML did not have a significant effect on the Company's capital due to the limit of catastrophe
reinsurance purchased.

‘+ No attempt has been made at this time to identify and measure a climate scenario equivalent to
two-degrees of Celsius.

‘+ The Exposure Management function within ERM works closely with the underwriting, actuarial
pricing and ceded reinsurance teams to inform of the adequacy of AmTrust's reinsurance
purchasing as compared to the risk appetites

‘+ The Company's insurance contracts are renewable annually, which would enable the Company to
quickly respond to changes as needed by adjusting its pricing or by restricting its exposure.

‘+ AmTrust’s preference for small risks provides a natural diversification against climate change
catastrophe due to the spread of the risks within and between geographic regions.

‘+ AmTrust manages its coastal wind exposures based on state-specific eligibility criteria reflecting
the building's distance to the coast, construction, as well as the age and condition of the roof.
Underwriting actions have reduced coastal exposures in Florida and along the Gulf Coast to further
mitigate large hurricane events.

‘+ To mitigate its exposure to extreme weather events in hail-prone areas, AmTrust maintains
eligibility requirements on an assessment of the insured vulnerability to damaging hail hazard, plus
the building's characteristics, such as a building's roof area, covering materials, and equipment e.g
HVAC or solar panels,

‘+ Corrective pricing and underwriting measures in Property Northeast have limited exposure growth
to reduce property catastrophe aggregation risk.

Investment Valuations -

The value of the types of financial instruments in which the Company is invested could be significantly
impacted if the market develops a perception that the issuer is either not adequately managing its climate
change risk or is accumulating a competitive disadvantage by not adapting its business strategy.

Mitigants:

‘+ AmTrust has analyzed its investment portfolio to determine the concentration of fossil fuel
investments, as well as other carbon related investments. The Company's fossil fuel investments
comprise less than 10% of its overall group-wide investment portfolio

‘+ The investment portfolio consists of readily marketable investment-grade fixed-income securities
with relatively short duration. As such, climate change risk on the Company's investment portfolio

C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks
are integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.
In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the
following:
+ Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's general enterprise-
risk management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks,
including which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what
timeframes are considered.
+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments,
including which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes

The potential impact to AmTrust’s underwriting portfolio from the increased physical risk potential due to
climate fluctuations are as follows:

‘+ In Coastal areas along the U.S. Eastem coast and Gulf Coast, the potential of climate
fluctuations has a higher hurricane, tropical, extra tropical or noreaster storm event frequency
and severity, which could increase policyholder losses for personal and commercial property
and commercial auto coverages.

‘+ InNon-coastal areas, the potential risk of climate fluctuations is increased convective storm
events or severe weather (winds/derecho/straight-line, hail, flood, tornado, lightning, single day
adverse precipitation event, etc.) causing frequency and severity, which could increase losses
for personal and commercial property and commercial auto coverages. This could result in
higher policyholder losses in any area within the United States, but is at an increased level in

ey! 12

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
states where AmTrust currently has exposure, such as Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Louisiana.

‘+ Apotential risk of climate fluctuations is an increased frequency and severity of wildfire events,
which could increase policyholder losses for commercial property and auto coverages.

‘+ A potential risk of climate fluctuations is increased groundwater withdrawal and drought leading
to land subsidence issues, both inland and coastal, which could increase losses for commercial
property coverages in the lower Midwest and Southeastern states.

+ Reinsurance could become more expensive and scarce if climate induced events become more
frequent and severe.

‘+ AmTrust utilizes industry specific CAT predictive modelling, concentration monitoring tools and
risk management solutions to manage its exposure to climate fluctuations and impacts including
adjusting its guidelines and reinsurance retentions accordingly.

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment is in place and embedded in the ERM process.
The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee comprised of the Group CRO, International CRO, US
Head of Risk and other members of the ERM function. This committee, through the engagement of
management and other research, identifies new and changing risks to the business, tracks their
development and assesses the risk they pose to the Company. These risks are highlighted in the quarterly
ERM report and shared with the Risk Committee.
ERM's Exposure Management Team regularly performs detailed analysis of the property and workers’
‘compensation insurance portfolios. On a quarterly basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures
are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models, with separate modeling for the perils of hurricane, convective
storm, winter storm and wildfire. Hurricane modelled results are based on the warm sea surface
temperature catalogue, which recognize the near/medium term view on sea temperatures and capture the
increased frequency and severity of hurricanes experienced in these warmer periods.
B. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks.
AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, storm
surge, inland flooding or wildfires. The Company manages its exposure to adverse weather risks through
disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control, and risk transfer. AmTrust
considers extreme weather events in pricing and underwriting its insurance products. To determine the
premium associated with the costs of these extreme events AmTrust relies on historical storm data, as well
as utilizing catastrophe models to supplement this historical data due to the infrequent nature of extreme
weather events
AmTrust manages its coastal wind exposures based on state-specific eligibility criteria reflecting the
building's distance to the coast, construction, as well as the age and condition of the roof. To mitigate its
exposure to extreme weather events in hail-prone areas, the Company maintains eligibility requirements
on an assessment of the insured vulnerability to damaging hail hazard, plus the building's characteristics,
such as a building's roof area, covering materials, and equipment e.g. HVAC or solar panels. AmTrust
utilizes catastrophe models to manage its portfolio's probable maximum losses to these types of extreme
events.
AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year catastrophe PML
be protected by reinsurance purchases for property and workers’ compensation, respectively. The
modelled 1:250-year catastrophe PML for property and workers’ compensation are monitored against
approved risk appetites. In addition, the Company runs Lloyd's Realistic Disaster Scenarios to estimate the
potential losses incurred from a variety of hypothetical disaster scenarios, using consistent and appropriate
methods and assumptions, which allow for the recognition of exposure changes in various geographic areas.
Climate change financial stress is considered annually in the Company's ORSA report. The hurricane
exceedance probability curve was adjusted to reflect climate change by increasing the frequency of
hurricane Category 3 events by 15%, Category 4 events by 25%, Category 5 events by 35%, and
increasing storm surge ground up losses by 35%. The post-stress Universal Best's Capital Adequacy
Ratio (BCAR) is used to assess capital adequacy on a group level. AmTrust's capital risk appetite is to
ey! 13

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99"" percentile which results in a BCAR
assessment of “Adequate”. The 1:200-year PML with the aforementioned adjustments for climate change
did not result in a significant stress to the Company's capital due to the level of reinsurance coverage in
place
The Exposure Management Team works closely with the underwriting, actuarial pricing and ceded
reinsurance teams to inform AmTrust's reinsurance purchasing.
Management of climate-related risks is incorporated into the Company's risk function. The Company is
conducting a core risk assessment and developing a Climate Change Financial Risk Framework (‘the
Framework""). The Framework will be used to monitor exposure to climate change and how it could impact
the resilience of the Company's financial and physical operations.
The Company will consider including additional stress scenarios that simulate potential impacts relating to
climate risks into its ORSA process. Additionally, the Company uses data from the scientific community
and resources provided by the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures to advise its risk
team and keep up to date of potential consequences or opportunities of climate-related impacts that it
incorporates into its risk assessment. This will support strategic decision making by providing
management and the board with a deeper understanding of the impact of a given climate scenario on its
chosen business model and strategy. This is an important step to embed the Framework into the
Company's strategy, governance, and decision-making process.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment is in place and embedded in the general ERM
process. The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee, which identifies new and changing risks to the
business. The ERM function is responsible for monitoring climate-related risks that impact the
‘Company's insurance business. The Company's Global Chief Risk Officer provides to the Company's

ERM's Exposure Management Team has been regularly performing detailed analysis over the property and

American natural catastrophe exposures are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models, with separate
modeling for the perils of hurricane, convective storm, winter storm and wildfire. Hurricane modelled results
are based on the warm sea surface temperature catalogue, which recognize the near/medium term view

assumptions,

3 events by 15%, Category 4 events by 25%, Category 5 events by 35%, and increasing storm surge

ground up losses by 35%. The post-stress Universal Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (‘BCAR’) is used to

assess capital adequacy on a group level. The group's capital risk appetite is to maintain a Universal

The Exposure Management Team works closely with the underwriting, actuarial pricing and also the ceded

reinsurance team to inform AmTrust's reinsurance purchasing.

A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in

line with its strategy and risk management process.

The Company maintains catastrophe risk appetites that are currently defined based on the modelled 1:250-

year catastrophe PMLs (per occurrence). Management monitors that these loss events are protected by

adequate reinsurance structures. Exposure to these events is regularly simulated for the property and

workers’ compensation portfolios. AFSI compares the reinsurance limits and the simulated PML from

realistic disaster scenarios, and also the net loss resulting from a 1:250 year hurricane event as a ratio to

surplus.

‘The Company has started to measure its 2023 Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (""GHG"") emissions

in 2024. Most of AmTrust's Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions come from office activity and company-

‘owned/controlled mobile combustion sources. The Company has not set any GHG emissions reduction

targets but plans on developing strategies to mitigate emissions.

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and

the related risks.

The Company is beginning to measure its baseline Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. AmTrust

aims to partner with a third party to measure and validate its emissions and plans to disclose next year.

C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and

performance against targets.

‘AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year catastrophe

PMLs be protected by reinsurance purchases for property and workers’ compensation, respectively. On

a quarterly basis, the modelled 1:250 year catastrophe PMLs for property and workers’ compensation are

monitored against this target. AmTrust's catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance purchases annually

correspond to the 1:250-year hurricane PML.

Dear Ms. Dwyer:
Please accept the enclosed response to the Climate Risk Disclosure Survey for Reporting Year 2023
by The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company (the “Company’).
For several years, the Company has considered climate risk as part of its enterprise risk management
in order to determine whether recently observed changing weather patterns could indicate a greater
likelihood of a risk event with resulting financial and/or operational implications for the Company.
In addition, the Company has implemented certain measures in order to respond to such potential
risks. It has also made operational changes in order to address its own impact on climate change.
Finally, the Company has assisted its policyholders with loss prevention training and guidance in
response to the increased threat which climate change poses to certain workforce populations.
Please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have regarding our responses. We are
happy to discuss the items contained within this report.

B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
‘The Company is a monoline workers’ compensation carrier insuring employers with risk exposure
mainly in Rhode Island and nearby northeastern states. The Company recognizes the threat of
climate change to the overall economy and sustainability across the world, including the potential
financial consequences as the severity and frequency of weather-related events continue to rapidly
increase. The Company also recognizes opportunities exist around climate change initiatives and
considers these when making business decisions, setting operating budgets, and strategic plans.
‘The Company's Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for oversight of all risks, monitoring
business strategies and approving operating budgets set forth by senior management. This top-down
approach provides appropriate oversight and guidance.
‘The Company maintains an Enterprise Risk Management framework that contemplates all risks the
Company faces, including climate related risks and exposures to its business. As further described
herein, the Company's management continuously assesses and updates enterprise risk and presents
the updated framework to the Board of Directors each June
On an ongoing basis, the Company uses underwriting standards, loss prevention programs,
reinsurance coverage, business continuity/disaster recovery planning and advice from its
investment advisors to help manage climate change risks. The Company also considers climate
related opportunities when setting business plans and strategies.
The Company does not currently have any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and
opportunities. However, the Company's awareness of climate change risks and opportunities is
reflected in its operations, business decisions and community involvement. The Company has also
acted to reduce and/or mitigate its carbon footprint through implementation of a variety of
operational and facilities changes which are discussed further herein.

In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the
short, medium, and longer term, insurers should consider including the following:
* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-Syears as short term, 5-1Oyears as
medium term, and 10-30years as long term.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business,
strategy, and financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business,
strategy, and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low
carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
‘ Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-
related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
The Company is mainly exposed to natural disasters occurring in the northeast, since in addition to
its main Rhode Island market, the majority of its out-of-state policy coverage is in Massachusetts and
Connecticut. There is minimal exposure outside of New England.
‘The Company maintains strong business continuity and disaster recovery plans which are regularly
tested to ensure they remain current and are well practiced. The Company maintains a data center
in New England and data backups in the Southwest in order to mitigate the risk exposure of regional
weather-related closures and ensure continuity of operations.
Significant worldwide weather events, including active hurricane seasons for the United States, could
impact the reinsurance market. Although not directly related to the Company's business as a
monoline workers’ compensation carrier, such impacts could result in collective price increases in
the reinsurance market. The Company maintains a strong reinsurance program and works
proactively with its broker to maintain appropriate and cost-effective coverage.
Climate change also presents morbidity and mortality impacts on the Company's workers’

compensation loss exposures for outdoor workers, including from increased exposure to extreme
temperature conditions and tick-borne diseases due to warmer weather patterns. The Company
addresses such risks through underwriting analysis, schedule credits for sound loss mitigation
programs, and loss prevention training
Inaddition to engaging policyholders on the topic of climate change through loss prevention training
and guidance, the Company has developed perspective on certain environmental, social and
governance (ESG) issues through dialogue with other state workers’ compensation funds, insurance
carriers, auditors and stakeholders in order to incorporate sustainability considerations in its
decision-making activities and processes. The Company recently sponsored the Greater Providence
Chamber of Commerce's education program on ESG Sustainability Initiatives and had several
managers and senior managers participate in an ESG certification program.
The Company utilizes the services of New England Asset Management (NEAM) for investment
advisory services and asset management. NEAM evaluates and integrates climate change risk as a
risk factor within their investment process. Climate change risk is considered at both the sector and
individual credit level. Industries within the corporate and municipal sectors are classified into
separate risk buckets and the most impacted industries are identified. A more thorough analysis is
then conducted at the issuer level to estimate the severity of the potential impact of transition and /or
physical risk. This analysis is conducted on an ongoing basis and forms the basis for decisions to
mitigate climate change risk within investment portfolios.
The Company is mindful of the importance of incorporating sustainability into its employee
engagement efforts. In addition to its charitable support of organizations focused on environmental
stewardship, the Company's employees have participated in volunteer activities to raise awareness
and mitigate the impact of climate change.
Also, the Company has implemented several operational improvements which help with the
transition to a low carbon economy. For example, the Company maintains a hybrid work
environment whereby employees generally work remotely three days per week. Such flexibility
results in reduced commuting by its employees, and as a result, contributes to the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions from employee transportation. In addition, the Company's carbon
footprint is reduced by fewer employees working in its office, which results in less opening/closing
of doors, reduced heatload from body temperature, and diminished use of electricity within the office
building. Other measures taken by the Company include participation in an energy efficiency lighting
assessment and conversion to high efficiency LED lighting for all interior and exterior lighting
sources at its facility; utilization of energy efficient window treatments to reduce heating and cooling
resources; transition to paperless operations and reduced printer use; support of recycling activities;
and ongoing participation by facilities management in energy efficiency training. The Company is in
the process of replacing existing boilers with high efficiency condensing boilers. A future capital
project plan considers items such as improvements to the HVAC system, including potentially more
energy-efficient equipment. Beacon recognizes the opportunities presented by these initiatives and
incorporates them into strategic planning to meet stakeholder expectations.

As a monoline workers’ compensation carrier, the Company manages the impact of climate risk on
its loss exposure through underwriting analysis of work hazards impacted by climate risk. It offers
schedule credits to policyholders which have implemented sound loss mitigation efforts. The
Company's loss prevention staff regularly conducts policyholder outreach and support through
educational materials and training, including with regard to extreme weather events and tick-borne
disease exposures which may be exacerbated in frequency or severity due to climate change.
Metrics and Targets — narrative
4, Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:
Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your
business, Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to
assess, if any.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line
with its strategy and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and
opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process, insurers should
consider including the following:
In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate
scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount
of financed or underwritten carbon emissions)
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the
related risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
The Company uses underwriting standards, loss prevention programs, reinsurance coverage,
business continuity/disaster recovery planning and advice from its investment advisors to help
manage climate change risks. The Company uses computer modeling to assist with identification and
management of loss exposure, and although the Company does not specifically incorporate climate
risk factors in its computer modeling, it does identify seasonality which would account for
extraordinary weather events in its underwriting and loss analysis.

Introduction
We are appropriately responding to climate risk for our organization by understanding and
planning for increasing weather-related catastrophes brought on by changing weather patterns.
Our solid capital position and extensive abilities to model potential losses give us confidence to
profitably grow our insurance business across the United States. To do our part to slow climate
change, we are implementing sound environmental office and fleet practices, offering products
that encourage green rebuilding options after a covered claim and encouraging paperless
delivery of policy and shareholder documents. We ensure that we are ready to fulfill our
responsibilities far into the future because we act with integrity and high ethical standards.
The insurance industry has been called the economy's financial first responders. After a major
catastrophe — earthquake, hurricane, tornado or wildfire — ravages a community, the insurance
industry starts the process of making people and businesses whole again. That's a
responsibility The Cincinnati Insurance Companies doesn't take lightly. It underscores why we
believe we must focus on business initiatives and strategies that fulfill our desire to be a steady,
fair and responsible insurance carrier.
However, as an industry, insurance agents and carriers support our clients beyond providing
coverage for unexpected events. Through the underwriting process, we conduct inspections to
identify potential risks and encourage additional safety measures that can reduce the frequency
or severity of losses, and perhaps even avoid a loss altogether.
Governance
Board Oversight and Senior Management
Our policy is to incorporate climate change-related risks into our overall risk management
program. One of the main risks addressed by our enterprise risk management (ERM) process is
the risk of insured losses from extreme weather events, in part influenced by climate change.
Our chief risk officer is responsible for overseeing enterprise risk management within our
organization, including risks related to climate change. This position reports to the president and
chief executive officer and is supported by a team of representatives from multiple business
areas. Our chief risk officer reports on risk assessments, risk metrics and risk plans to our
president and chief executive officer and our board of directors, as appropriate. We continue to
study climate change risk and its potential effects. As with any risk, we seek to identify the
extent of the risk exposure and possible actions to mitigate potential negative effects of the risk
at an enterprise level.
Strategy
Climate Risks
In the normal course of our business, both in our insurance and reinsurance operations, we
provide coverage against perils for which estimates of losses are highly uncertain. Natural peril
catastrophe events to which we may be exposed include, but are not limited to, hurricanes,
tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, landslides, hailstorms, flooding, severe winter weather
and wildfires. Due to the nature of these events, we are unable to predict precisely the
frequency or potential cost of catastrophe occurrences. Various scientists and other experts
believe that changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency and

3

severity of such natural disasters in certain parts of the world and have created additional
uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. We cannot predict the impact that changing
climate conditions may have on our results of operations nor can we predict how any legal,
regulatory or social responses to concerns about climate change may impact our business.
Changes in regulation on climate change issues affecting the insurance industry could increase
‘our cost of doing business or could restrict our ability to conduct business. Regulatory changes
could cause unexpected and unintended issues related to insurance pricing, claims and
coverage. These issues may adversely affect our business by impeding our ability to obtain
adequate rates for covered risks, extending coverage beyond underwriting intent or by
increasing the number or size of claims.
Climate Opportunities
We can offer our insurance policyholders new products, such as coverage for green buildings,
allowing them to rebuild damaged buildings so they become more energy efficient despite
potential changes in temperature extremes. To the extent that our insurance underwriting and
pricing is appropriate, we can grow our business with adequate profitability to benefit our
insurance agencies and shareholders.
Pricing and related planned revenues, particularly for property risks subject to climate change,
can be significant and is an impact we consider in the financial planning process. Operating
costs can be affected by lowering facility or fleet operating expenses, and despite those items
representing a relatively small amount of total operating costs they are considered in our
financial planning process. We are in a service industry, property casualty and life insurance,
and therefore have a relatively small amount of capital expenditures. How we allocate capital to
support our insurance operations is influenced in part by risks related to climate change as
certain types of insurance products are more sensitive to severe weather.
Doing Green Business
Our Executive Capstone™ homeowner insurance policy automatically provides some coverage
for the reasonable costs to repair or replace covered, damaged property with green alternatives.
A Green Upgrade coverage endorsement is also available and offers broader benefits, such as
coverage for green upgrade expenses after a covered loss.
We have offered a commercial property green endorsement since 2013. Our green
endorsement provides policyholders with:
* additional coverage, at no additional charge, to cover the increased cost of repairing a
building insured at replacement cost values with a current green certification
* coverage, at an additional premium charge, to repair a building not currently green
certified using green materials and building techniques to help it qualify for green
certification in the future
Incorporating Climate Considerations into Our Investment Philosophy
We recognize that we must balance risk and reward in our investment philosophy and strategies
to achieve value for our shareholders, while also protecting policyholders. We invest the money
earned through our insurance operations, pursuing a total return investment strategy that
generates both investment income growth and capital appreciation, providing a return to
shareholders through a combination of earnings, growth in book value, increasing dividends and
share repurchases.
4

The investment department factors all elements of risk in its analysis, including climate factors,
in addition to significant regulatory requirements designed to make sure that an insurer has the
liquidity necessary to pay claims as they arise.
Our investment department operates under risk guidelines set forth in our investment policy
along with oversight of the investment committee of our board of directors. These guidelines set
parameters for risk tolerances governing, among other items, the allocation of the portfolio as.
well as security and sector concentrations. These parameters are part of an integrated
corporate risk management program. When allocating cash to various asset classes, we
consider market-based factors such as risk adjusted after-tax yields as well as internal
measures based in part on insurance department regulations and rating agency guidance.
Climate Considerations in Our Investment Portfolio and Other Investments
Fixed-maturity securities are the largest part of our investment portfolio and are intended to
cover our insurance obligations. By maintaining a well-diversified fixed-maturity portfolio, we
attempt to manage overall interest rate, reinvestment, credit and liquidity risk. We pursue a buy-
and-hold strategy and do not attempt to make large-scale changes to the portfolio in anticipation
of rate movements. By investing new money on a regular basis and analyzing risk-adjusted
after-tax yields, we work to achieve a general laddering effect to our portfolio that may mitigate
some of the effects of adverse interest rate movements.
We support the communities where we live and work through investments in municipal bonds.
These bonds are debt securities issued by states, cities, counties and other governmental
entities to fund day-to-day obligations and to finance capital projects such as building schools,
highways or sewer systems.
Our equity investment strategy includes pursuing market exposure with an eye toward
sector diversification as a risk management tool. We have positions in all S&P 500 sectors,
including energy.
We believe market forces will ultimately drive adaptive management teams at high-quality
companies, such as Exxon Mobil Corporation and Chevron Corporation, to be a part of the
long-term solution to carbon alternatives. By investing in these companies, we are supporting
economic stability during the energy transition to low-carbon alternatives.
Engagement on Climate Policy
Our company indirectly influences climate change policy through our membership in the
American Property Casualty Insurers Association (APCIA). We believe the APCIA is a
significant policy influencer with respect to climate change issues and an officer of our company
regularly engages with the organization to ensure alignment with our interests and strategy on
such issues. In addition, our chairman serves on the board of APCIA.
Our regulatory review team participates in industry trade groups that keep our company abreast
of regulatory and statutory changes. We maintain strong and healthy relationships with state
insurance regulators and carefully monitor market conditions, including those that are influenced
by local regulatory changes.

Maintaining Eco-Friendly Operations
Our campus consists of 107 acres, which includes 49 acres of green space. We follow a holistic
grounds management program that addresses the impacts of our hardscape, as well as
sustainable landscaping initiatives to maintain our campus. When we expand or update the
campus, we have used environmentally responsible features for energy consumption and
recycling of materials.
Our 48,000 square-foot business continuity center received LEED® gold certification. The LEED
(Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) rating system is the recognized authority for
measuring “green” buildings.
Our headquarters earned its 2024 ENERGY STAR® certification for superior energy
performance driven by efforts to save energy, reduce pollution and increase efficiency.
To receive this certification, commercial buildings must perform in the top 25% of similar
buildings nationwide, based on key metrics such as energy performance, occupancy, hours of
operation and more.
In addition, a carpooling program for associates helps ease traffic congestion and pollution near
our Fairfield, Ohio, headquarters. Carpool drivers receive $2.50 per day per roundtrip and
$1.25 per day per one-way passenger.
Updating Our Indoor Office Environment
We recognize that a quality indoor office environment increases productivity by keeping
associates healthy and comfortable. We have used a certified green janitorial service and
prohibited tobacco use on our campus for a number of years.
In 2021, we completed a multiyear, floor-by-floor renovation of the oldest of the three office
buildings that comprise our headquarters. Updates included brand-new restrooms and
kitchenettes as well as new ceilings, LED lighting, carpeting, wall coverings and LEED-qualified
office furniture. Air diffusers and increased natural lighting also contribute to a better indoor
environment in all three office buildings.
Enhancements to our HVAC systems in 2021 resulted in improved air quality and safety in
‘our headquarters office buildings:
‘+ Adding UVC lighting to air handlers
‘* Increased humidification

Striving to Recycle, Reuse and Donate
Recycling of paper, cardboard, cans and bottles reflect our associates’ efforts to find ways of
incorporating environmental awareness into our daily operations. Recycling bins are located in
the community kitchenettes on each floor of our headquarters office buildings.
Associates organized an annual community shred day in conjunction with ARMA International,
a nonprofit professional association for records managers and administrators. The 2023 and
2022 events both collected approximately 5 tons of paper for recycling.

6

In addition to these associate-led efforts, our corporate recycling activity in 2023 included

* 14.4 tons of electronic equipment

‘* 362 pounds of printer toner

‘* 150 tons of paper

* 17 tons of cardboard
Our initiatives to reduce the amount of paper we use are wide-ranging and have included
eliminating old printers, fax machines and copiers in favor of centrally located multi-function
devices capable of printing, copying, scanning and faxing documents. Our corporate copy paper
usage has declined more than 50% since 2017.
Approximately 50% of the office supply products purchased from Office Depot in 2023 were
considered green products. In 2022, we received Office Depot's Leadership in Green
Purchasing award based on the volume of eco-conscious products purchased in 2021,
compared with other large customers. We also take part in an annual program with Office Depot
and the Arbor Day Foundation to offset our copy paper purchases with the planting of new trees
in our National Forests.
Helping Policyholders and Shareholders Go Paperless
Converting policyholders to paperless options eliminates the need to print and mail multi-page
policy documents, avoiding postal mailing and related emissions. Personal lines policyholders
can go paperless and receive policy information via a secure online portal or through the
MyCincinnatis™ mobile app for Android™ and Apple® devices. As of year-end 2023, more than
30% of our personal lines policyholders had gone paperless.
Along with the mobile app, we introduced a mobile wallet program in early 2018. Using Android
and Apple devices, personal lines policyholders can view a statement summary and access
their accounts. The mobile wallet program supplements online payment, pay-by-phone and
electronic funds transfer options and has more than 20,000 subscribers.
In 2021, we implemented paperless policy delivery for nearly all our business insurance policies.
Instead of automatically receiving paper copies of a clients’ business insurance documents, our
independent agents now have options to manage their clients’ policy delivery preferences.
We also introduced an online portal for business policyholders in 2021, making it easier to make
payments, view billing history and select options for paperless billing delivery and notifications.
As a public company, we publish an annual report to shareholders, which includes our 2023
Annual Report on Form 10-K, a letter to shareholders and our Annual Shareholder Meeting
Notice and Proxy Statement. We have steadily decreased the number of copies that are printed
and mailed as more shareholders choose to receive these materials electronically.
Shareholders who opt for e-delivery enjoy quick access to information as well as reducing the
amount of paper received and the environmental impact associated with U.S. postal mailings.

Loss Control
Our loss control representatives, claims representatives and underwriters provide information,
inspections and assistance to policyholders regarding improvements they can make to their
properties to reduce the losses caused by climate change-influenced events.
Terms, conditions and premiums of our policies are aligned with risk-reducing behavior.
For example, policyholders are encouraged to mitigate risk by receiving credits for actions such
as installing shutters to protect against hurricane loss, sprinkler systems to protect against fire
and updated systems and roofs that protect buildings in severe winter weather.
Risk Management
Overview
We manage enterprise risk, including cybersecurity risk, through formal risk management
programs overseen by an executive officer of the company. Our ERM framework includes an
enterprise risk management committee, which is responsible for overseeing risk activities and is
comprised of senior executive-level risk owners from across the enterprise. The risk committee's
activities are supported by a team of representatives from business areas that focus on
identifying, evaluating and developing risk plans for emerging risks, including cybersecurity
risks. A comprehensive report is provided quarterly to our president and chief executive officer
and also to our board of directors and our senior executive team, as appropriate, on the status
of risk metrics relative to identified tolerances and limits, risk assessments and risk plans.
The use of operational audits, strategic plans and departmental business plans, as well as our
culture of open communications and fundamental respect for our Code of Conduct, continue to
help us manage risks on an ongoing basis. Our efforts to assess, identify and manage material
risks from cybersecurity threats is further discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on form 10-K
Item 1C, Cybersecurity.
Our risk management programs include a formalized risk appetite element and a risk
identification and quantification process. The overall enterprise objective is to appropriately
balance risk and reward to achieve an appropriate return on risk capital. Our key risks are
discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K Item 1A, Risk Factors, including risks
related to natural catastrophes, investments and operations.
Identifying Climate-Related Risks and Modeling
Climate change has been identified as a key risk and various scenarios have been developed to
quantify and manage it. As with any risk, we seek to identify the extent of the risk exposure and
possible actions to mitigate potential negative effects of risk at an enterprise level.
In recent years the U.S. property casualty industry has experienced elevated levels of weather-
related insured losses. Our company and policyholders have experienced similar trends. We
have increased our use of models to predict the risk of loss and the effects on the company's
financial strength, in addition to determining appropriate pricing for insurance products providing
coverage to property exposed to weather-related losses.
We use computer models to model catastrophes and their impacts on our business, both
concerning individual severe events and multiple less-severe events. We use these same
models to manage concentrations of risks and develop growth and diversification plans and to
transfer risk through reinsurance programs. We run specific scenarios to evaluate the impact of
8

risks given different severity levels and geographic impacts. Models are used to identify areas
that may have been impacted by severe weather so we can serve our policyholders faster
and better.
The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured and
reinsured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Our ability to
appropriately manage catastrophe risk depends partially on catastrophe models, which may be
affected by inaccurate or incomplete data, the uncertainty of the frequency and severity of future
events and the uncertain impact of climate change. Additionally, these models are recalibrated
and changed over time, with more data availability and changing opinions regarding the effect of
current or emerging loss patterns and conditions.
According to these models and as disclosed on page 31 in our 2023 Annual Report on Form
40K, probable maximum loss estimates from a single hurricane event that combine the effects
of property casualty insurance written on a direct basis by The Cincinnati Insurance Companies,
the Cincinnati Re® reinsurance portfolio and risks insured by Cincinnati Global Underwriting
Ltd.S* include the following amounts, net of amounts recoverable through reinsurance ceded
and also income taxes, and including the effects of estimated reinstatement premiums:
$570 million for a once-in-a-100-year event and $848 million for a once-in-a-250-year event.
Please see our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources,
2024 Reinsurance Programs, for a discussion of modeled losses considered in evaluating our
risk mitigation strategy, which includes our ceded reinsurance program.
Techniques and tools used include evaluating frequency or likelihood of various risks or
opportunities along with estimated impact. Risk tolerances and limits are also determined,
in part by dynamic financial analysis that simulates numerous events and outcomes with
various levels of probability, providing confidence that the company's financial strength is
adequate to pay obligations to insurance policyholders. Weather-related catastrophe losses
that are influenced by climate change are a prominently featured aspect in the tools and related
reports assessing risks/opportunities. We use catastrophe models to identify the impact of
weather-related losses on our business and to identify how these losses are expected
to change.
We use deterministic scenario models to evaluate the potential cost of climate change and are
integrating responses proportional to the modeled impact to our company. The models are used
to look at short and long-term historical data as well as future projections over various return
periods to identify areas of concern and set appropriate risk limits, underwriting guidelines,
growth plans, reinsurance purchases and programs to reduce policyholder losses. Our focus is
on singular events as well as multiple events that could impact our company's financial results
and operations over time.
We also use a three-pronged strategy to assess and manage risks, all of which include the
evaluation of weather and investment-related risks. We use a sophisticated, stochastic
‘economic capital model to evaluate the impact of over 100,000 different risk trials — including
natural catastrophe and investment scenarios — to understand their effects on our capital
position and business plan. We also do a robust, bi-annual risk assessment, evaluating our key
risks both qualitatively and quantitatively. These risks include impacts from natural catastrophes
and investments as well as combinations such as a pandemic causing a global financial
recession. Finally, our investment and underwriting units have authorization levels, policies and
procedures that are used to manage the risks managed in those units every day. These risk

9

management practices necessarily allow us to see the impacts and correlations of various risks
to each other and allow us to put management systems in place to appropriately address.
Our catastrophe models are also discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item
1A, Risk Factors, page 30, and Item 7, 2024 Reinsurance Ceded Programs, page 105.
Mitigation of Climate Risks in Our Underwriting and Pricing Decisions
We continue to refine our comprehensive, enterprise-level catastrophe management program,
including risks from extreme weather-related events, to identify an overall tolerance for
catastrophe risk and regional guidelines that work with our underwriting and reinsurance efforts.
We are developing additional models to better understand risk exposures and correlations. We
seek to diversify our catastrophe exposure by expanding our operations geographically and
obtain reinsurance from highly rated reinsurers to mitigate underwriting risk.
Across the 46 states where our property casualty companies operate, climate change could
influence extreme weather events, including hurricanes (primarily coastal states), tornadoes,
windstorms, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires. As a result, insured losses for our
property casualty insurance business would adversely affect our financial performance and
condition if the level of losses we experience over a period of time were to exceed our
actuarially determined expectations.
Our property lines of business are the most exposed and we are actively expanding
‘our geographic footprint to areas of the U.S. that have a different or reduced catastrophe
loss potential.

We discuss our consolidated property casualty insurance results, including catastrophe losses,
in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning on page 62.
Probable Maximum Loss
A single large loss or an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency due to a catastrophic
event is a risk to the company’s liquidity and financial strength. To control such losses, we limit
marketing property casualty insurance in specific geographic areas and monitor our exposure in
certain coastal regions. Examples of this include limiting our earthquake writings in the New
Madrid region or leveraging more restrictive terms and conditions through the use of our excess
and surplus company in higher risk areas for wildfire or hurricane. Loss exposures in these
areas have been identified as a major contributor to our catastrophe probable maximum.
loss estimates. We also continually review aggregate exposures to large disasters and
purchase reinsurance protection to cover these exposures. For business other than Cincinnati
Re and Cincinnati Global, we use the Risk Management Solutions (RMS) and Applied
Insurance Research (AIR) models to evaluate exposures to a once-in-a-100-year and a once-in-
a-250-year event to help determine appropriate reinsurance coverage programs. In conjunction
with these activities, we also continue to evaluate information provided by our reinsurance
broker. Examples include deterministic modeling of probable maximum loss contribution from
growth in new geographic territories.
To help determine appropriate reinsurance coverage for hurricane, earthquake and severe
convective storm exposures, for business other than Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, we
use the RMS and AIR models to estimate the probable maximum loss from a single event or
multiple events occurring in a one-year period. The models are proprietary in nature, and the
vendors that provide them periodically update the models, sometimes resulting in significant
changes to their estimate of probable maximum loss. As of the end of 2023, both models
indicated that a hurricane event represents our largest amount of exposure to losses. The table
below summarizes estimated probabilities and the corresponding probable maximum loss from
a single hurricane event occurring in a one-year period, for business other than Cincinnati Re
and Cincinnati Global, and indicates the effect of such losses on consolidated shareholders’

beginning on page 105.
Reducing Energy Consumption and Emissions
The ability to manage our energy consumption with greater precision and efficiency has helped
achieve reductions in electricity and natural gas use. While weather patterns influence
consumption for purposes of facility heating and cooling, we believe a significant portion of the
improvement is due to our environmental stewardship efforts. The facility consumption and
emissions graphs on the next page show trends over time.
We have participated in demand response programs since 2013, successfully transferring our
electrical load from the power grid to company generators during the required testing period.
Such transfers, upon request by our electric supplier, can provide stability to the power grid and
reduce the need for expansion of utility generation facilities.
In addition to reducing energy consumption, we improved 2023 fuel efficiency (miles per gallon)
of our company automobile fleet by approximately 21% since 2010, reducing emissions as more
fuel-efficient vehicles are added to the fleet and less efficient vehicles are retired from service.
We added a gas-electric hybrid option to our fleet vehicle program in 2016 and as of
December 31, 2023, hybrid vehicles represent approximately 7% of our fleet. Drivers selecting a
hybrid model receive a credit to help offset the price difference between the traditional and
hybrid models.
During 2023, emissions from the fossil fuels used to heat our facilities and power vehicles in our
company automobile fleet, in combination, were 22% lower than in 2010. Emissions during 2023
resulting from the generation of electricity used in our facilities declined 61% compared with
2010, which was the first year we tracked emissions from fossil fuels.
We are in a service industry, property casualty and life insurance, which we consider to be a
relatively low contributor to emissions. We continue to assess and consider risks and
opportunities regarding emissions. While our strategic focus is on providing superior service to
‘our customers and profitably growing our business to increase shareholder value, we also work
toward environmental stewardship. At this time we have not developed a forecast of how our
emissions might change in the next several years, but believe that ongoing efforts to reduce
postal mail with paperless solutions and to reduce consumption of electricity and gas at our
facilities will favorably affect emissions attributed to our company. The plan we are following is
to recycle, reduce use of and reuse resources appropriately and increase awareness of
environmental issues among our associates, led by a committee focusing on environmental risk
and sustainability. Expansion of our facilities in recent years have used environmentally
responsible features for energy consumption and recycling of materials, including a business
continuity facility that was awarded a Gold LEED rating. Our headquarters building earned
ENERGY STAR certification for 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. We have
reduced electricity usage approximately 54% below our 2010 level. We are committed to
serving our customers locally, placing field associates (approximately one-third of our total
employees) near the agencies and policyholders they serve, reducing their need for planes,
trains and longer automobile trips.

Narrative Response:
The Group recognizes the risks that climate change poses to our business through the increase
in the frequency of natural catastrophes ranging from hurricanes to convective storms and
flooding. The impacts of climate change primarily impact our Property book of business. We
have taken specific steps to limit these impacts through our:

© Distribution Strategies: In our southern tier of states, we refrain from making agency
appointments in coastal areas.

‘* Risk Selection and Pricing: In southern states, we avoid writing property risks with
significant property values. We typically write risks with incidental property values
that support larger accounts with predominantly inland properties. Our limited
property appetite in coastal areas reflects our assessment of the financial impact of
hurricanes and the increased frequency of hurricanes due to climate change. In
coastal areas, we have specific underwriting guidelines relative to distance to the
coast for risk acceptability. With respect to convective storms, we use geographic
storm indices to assess exposures and determine acceptable risks and pricing.

* Catastrophe Modeling: We use RMS and Verisk catastrophe modeling software to
measure our exposure to severe natural catastrophe events (hurricanes, convective
storms, winter storms) and buy catastrophe reinsurance accordingly to protect our
financial solvency.

The Group provides loss mitigation tips and recommendations for our policyholders through our
website and via several social media channels (Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter). The Group also conducts
property inspections and surveys for its policyholders and prospective policyholders and makes
property improvement recommendations to mitigate exposures to weather hazards.

The Group is a member company of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS). IBHS is
an industry association that research building standards and ways to increase the preparedness and
resiliency of homes and commercial buildings. IBHS shares this information with the insurance industry
and the public to promote loss mitigation and preparation. IBHS actively works with state and federal
legislators to promote improved building standards to reduce the financial impact of storms for
homeowners and businesses.

The Group established an ESG position paper to communicate with our internal management team
and Board of Directors relating to our efforts around climate change. The Group is also an active
member of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC) and supports the
BuildStrong Coalition. The BuildStrong Coalition works with state and federal legislators to promote
stronger building codes and pre-disaster mitigation funding.

The Group has considered the impact of climate change on its investment portfolio. A peer study by
the fixed-income investment manager revealed that 3.3% of Harford Mutual's fixed-income portfolio
was labeled “green” compared to the P&C insurance industry's 2.4%. To date, the company has not
altered its investment strategy. It is important to note that there are no accepted or standard
definitions for what ESG factors are or are not.

Section IV - Metrics and Targets (narrative)

4, Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
‘opportunities where such information is material. In disclosing the metrics and targets used to
assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities where such information is
material, insurers should consider including the following:

to your business. Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses
catastrophe models to assess, if any.

* A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and

consider including the following:

i. In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks,
consider the amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies
vulnerable to climate-related physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and
percentages if possible], alignment with climate scenarios, (1 in 100 years
probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount of
financed or underwritten carbon emissions)

* B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, and the related risks.

+ C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and
opportunities and performance against targets.

Metrics and Targets (closed-ended questions answered in addition to the narrative)
* Does the insurer use catastrophe modeling to manage your climate-related risks? (Y/N)
© Answer: Yes
* Does the insurer use metrics to assess and monitor climate-related risks? (¥/N)
© Answer: Yes
* Does the insurer have targets to manage climate-related risks and opportunities? (Y/N)
© Answer: Yes
‘* Does the insurer have targets to manage climate-related performance? (Y/N)
© Answer: No
Narrative Response: The Group actively manages the risks that climate change poses to its financial
solvency and business growth using catastrophe modeling tools. We use RMS and AIR catastrophe
modeling software to measure our exposure to severe natural catastrophe events (hurricanes,
convective storms, winter storms, etc.). The modeling software used provides us with loss estimates
for various return periods. The Group buys catastrophe reinsurance accordingly from “A-” or better
reinsurers to protect its financial solvency based on the output from these modeling tools.

Maine Employers’ Mutual Insurance Company & The MEMIC Group’s response:
The Company's Enterprise Risk Management Committee considers all exogenous and endogenous risks to the
business. The Company does not have a specific formal process for identifying climate change-related risks. The
Company is a mono-line workers’ compensation insurer. Customer demand for our product is not directly
impacted by climate-related issues. The Company does not believe that climate risk will adversely impact liquidity,
surplus or cash outflows.

RESPONSE FOR GOVERNANCE
All risks, including climate-related risks are discussed at all levels and managed accordingly. The
Savings Bank Mutual Life Insurance Company of Massachusetts (SBLI) has also included
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) awareness in its investment practice. Over the short,
medium and long term SBLI is educating, evaluating, and implementing behaviors of the ESG set of
standards demonstrating that SBLI is socially conscious and aware of its community. Educational
sessions have been held with the Audit/ERM Committee regarding ESG. SBLI continues to maintain its
Business Continuity Plan with long term consideration to climate change risks.
Senior Management incorporates risk management in its decision-making process and set its risk
tolerance threshold at very low. As part of its ERM program, SBLI formed the Internal Risk Committee
as a forum for business line representatives to discuss concerns and identify risks on a regular basis.
Senior Management remains accountable for risks within their areas of responsibility and meets
routinely to evaluate concerns. The objective of SBLI’s ERM program is to identify, evaluate, and
develop an action plan for risks that exist throughout the Company. The results are used to assist in
planning and/or prioritizing components of the Company's strategy. The Audit/ERM Committee has an
oversight role in the process.

RESPONSE FOR STRATEGY
Asa life insurer, SBLI does not feel the need to strategize for a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
SBLI does not have a formal plan directed specifically at reducing emissions. However, as noted
below, we have taken several measures that have had that effect.
SBLI encourages its policyholders and applicants to take advantage of its numerous paperless
services. Included among them are: online applications; SMS/Texting reminder notices; online
customer portal for policy delivery; processing of transactions via the online customer portal; and
electronic document storage services.
We have in place centralized scanning of all incoming customer documents and recycling programs.
We have established a website for customers so they can review their account rather than sending
them hard copies of information. We give our customers the option to receive notices and other
information in an electronic - “paperless” -format. Additionally, we have recently introduced a new
SMS/Text Messaging service to provide certain policyholder notices/reminders in a non-paper
option.

We have also made improvements to our main office that have increased efficiencies. For instance,
we have installed more efficient air conditioning units, converted all lighting to LED lighting, and our
main office is powered 100% by electricity (no fossil fuels). We have significantly reduced our
electricity usage by moving our computer room to an offsite location. Additionally, we have added
four (4) electric car-charging stations to our employee parking lot for employee use.
We also have a hybrid workplace schedule (two days work from home) that has saved on commuter
gasoline and some overall energy use within the building itself.
Over the short, medium and long term SBLI is educating, evaluating, and implementing behaviors of
the ESG set of standards demonstrating that SBLI is socially conscious and aware of its community.
Educational sessions have been held with the Audit/ERM Committee regarding ESG. SBLI continues to
maintain its Business Continuity Plan with long term consideration to climate change risks.
RISK MANAGEMENT

RESPONSE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT

From a climate risk standpoint, our application submission and underwriting process over the last 10
plus years has consisted of a digital process with paperless solutions. Our underwriting requirements
including medical record submissions and laboratory results are all submitted digitally. The data is
assessed by an underwriting engine or the underwriter. Our Underwriting and New Business Teams
have the ability and/or are assigned to work from home.
Please refer to our “Strategy” response on how we encourage policyholders to take advantage of
paperless services.
SBLI does consider how climate change could affect our investment portfolio. As with any risk, we
take this into account when assessing investments. SBLI has taken steps to limit new exposure and
duration in thermal coal/high-carbon emission sectors. Furthermore, when considering investments,
SBLI focuses on steps companies are making to address climate change issues. Additionally, SBLI has
recently increased its allocation to renewable energy investments.
We tend to avoid companies that don’t have a plan to reduce their carbon footprint. In
addition, with regards to our existing holdings, we examine the cost of investment for
decarbonization plans and potential impacts of such investments on their credit profile.
We review these companies on at least an annual basis.
SBLI does consider how climate change could affect our investment portfolio. As with any risk, we take
this into account when assessing investments. SBLI has taken steps to limit new exposure and
duration in thermal coal/high-carbon emission sectors. Furthermore, when considering investments,
SBLI focuses on steps companies are making to address climate change issues.
Please refer to our “Governance” response on how the company manages climate related risk.
One important tool in the Company's ERM efforts is a quarterly ‘Balanced Scorecard’ developed to
measure and monitor key risk. We have undertaken a new initiative (AuditBoard) that will ensure
we are adequately addressing and managing top risks that we face as an organization. The
Actuarial and Investment functions complete annual modeling to assess and manage risk. SBLI does
not currently measure climate-related risk directly in the Balanced Scorecard.
SBLI’s commercial real estate holdings, a sector most likely susceptible to climate change, are
managed externally. The managers utilize a formal process to identify and assess hurricane/wind,

flood and sea level rise, heat stress, wildfire and water stress risks as part of the investment
underwriting process. Furthermore, Moody's 427 Climate Change Forecasting report is incorporated
on every property considered investment, to quantify these risks. Climate change risk is one of many
factors considered when making an investment.

The kinds of insurance written by the insurance company do not provide coverage for
losses caused by climate change or climate influenced events; and our policyholders
do not look to the Company for guidance on such losses. We do not define climate
risk in our policies.
Climate change is not a topic on which the Company has taken steps to engage our
constituencies, nor is it a topic on which they have looked to the Company for
engagement.
At this time, we do not believe that climate change is a significant risk factor for the
Company and have not performed any computer modeling or stress testing to

The company does an annual enterprise risk assessment and mid-year update at the
business unit level. During that review the business unit is responsible for
identification and assessment of the risks that the business unit will face in the coming
year. In the past, climate-related risks were not identified during these assessments as
a material risk that the company is likely to face.
Considering the types of insurance written by our company, we do not believe that
climate change is a significant risk factor for the Company and does not need to be
addressed as an ERM issue. The Company does not believe that there is a potential
correlated risk affecting asset management and underwriting for the Company. The
asset management portfolio of the investment advisory firm that is a sister-subsidiary

"
2023,2023_The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company.pdf,"Section 1 Governance: Disclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks
and opportunities.

Response:

This response to the NAIC Climate Risk Survey is submitted on behalf of the indirect insurance
company subsidiaries of Corebridge Financial, Inc. (“Corebridge”), American General Life
Insurance Company, The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, and The United States Life
Insurance Company in the City of New York (each a “Corebridge Insurer,” and collectively, the
“Corebridge Insurers”). Except as otherwise provided herein, responses with respect to Corebridge
apply to the Corebridge Insurers.

In September 2022, American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) completed the initial public
offering of Corebridge. As of June 30, 2024, AIG owned approximately 49.0% percent of
Corebridge. Corebridge is continuing to mature its governance around climate-related risks and
opportunities in line with our industry, geographic and business focus.

The Corebridge Board of Directors (“Corebridge Board”) has oversight responsibility for the
management of risk for Corebridge. Corebridge management has the day-to-day responsibility for
assessing and managing Corebridge’s risk exposure, and the Corebridge Board and the Corebridge
Audit Committee provide oversight in connection with those efforts, with particular focus on
reviewing Corebridge’s most significant existing and emerging risks. One of the Corebridge Audit
Committee’s key responsibilities is assisting the Corebridge Board in its oversight of the
Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Corebridge Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, established in June 2024, has responsibility for overseeing
Corebridge’s policies, practices and reporting with respect to current and emerging public policy
issues of significance to Corebridge, including issues of significance relating to climate. The
oversight and management of climate-related risks would fall within this general governance
framework.

Corebridge considers risk management an integral part of our business strategy and a key element
of our approach to corporate governance. We have an integrated process for managing risks
throughout our organization in accordance with our firmwide risk appetite. Management of
climate-related risks is subsumed within this integrated process.

In addition, the boards of directors of the Corebridge Insurers are responsible for the oversight of
climate risk and opportunities for the Corebridge Insurers. The Chief Investment Officer has been
designated as the board member and member of senior management responsible for climate risk
of the Corebridge Insurers. Periodic updates regarding climate risk are presented to the senior
management team and the Corebridge Insurer boards as appropriate. In 2024, a management
council (the “Sustainability Council”) was formed to consider sustainability-related issues,
including climate. The Council includes participation from the areas of investments, risk,
operations, investor relations and other periodic invitees.

Section 2 Strategy: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and
opportunities _on the insurer’s business, strategy, and financial planning where such
information is material.

Response:

Corebridge is a leading provider of retirement solutions and life insurance products in the United
States. Our primary business operations consist of sales of individual and group annuity products,
life insurance products to individuals and institutional markets products.

Corebridge considers the impacts of climate-related risks as discussed herein on our business,
operations, investments and financial condition, including but not limited to, potential direct
physical impacts and indirect effects due to transition risks, and those potentially arising from new
laws and regulations.

Physical Risks

Acute physical risks due to impacts from the climate may result in increased frequency and severity
of natural catastrophes. Catastrophes, including those associated with climate-related risks may
adversely affect our business and financial condition. This in turn could potentially affect
operational risks associated with business activities of Corebridge or third parties that Corebridge
relies upon to provide and adequately perform certain business, operations, investment advisory,
functional support and administrative services on our behalf, as well as business continuity risks.
In the event of a natural catastrophe disaster, unanticipated problems with our business continuity
plans could cause a material adverse effect on our disaster recovery or business, results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity. We could also experience a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of our insurance business
due to increased mortality and, in certain cases, morbidity rates and/or its impact on the economy
and financial markets. Additionally, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of our
reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries.

Investment Management and Related Risks

We manage general and separate account assets, and thus investment management is an integral
part of our business model. We aim to support our liabilities with a high quality and diversified
portfolio taking into consideration liability duration, convexity and liquidity profile. In addition,
we seek to originate assets that enable us to further manage our asset-liability profile, generate
enhanced risk-adjusted returns and iterate our product designs to improve our risk profile. Climate
-related risks, including physical and transition risk, may adversely affect the value of the securities
that we hold or lead to increased credit risk of other counterparties we transact business with,
including reinsurers. There is a risk that some asset sectors could face significantly higher costs
and a disorderly adjustment to asset values leading to an adverse impact on the value and future
performance of investment assets as a result of climate-related risks, and regulatory or other
responses thereto.

Transition Risks/Stakeholder Expectations

Our reputation or corporate brand could also be negatively impacted as a result of changing
customer or societal perceptions of organizations that we do business with or invest in due to their
actions (or lack thereof) with respect to climate-related risks. A failure to identify and address
these issues could cause a material adverse effect on the achievement of our strategies and
potentially subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, Corebridge may face
increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other
stakeholders regarding environmental and other related matters, including climate risks.
Legislators and regulators have imposed and likely will continue to impose environmental
legislation, rules and guidance, which may conflict with one another and impose additional costs
‘on us, block or impede our business opportunities, including by restricting contracting with state
governmental authorities or by imposing divestment requirements, or expose us to new or
additional risks.

Moreover, certain organizations that provide information, including information to investors, have
developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to different environmental and other
related matters. A lack of ratings or unfavorable ratings of our company or our industry may lead
to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries.
Additionally, the costs incurred to comply with, or our inability to meet, applicable requirements,
expectations, laws or regulations, some of which may be in contradiction with each other, could
result in adverse publicity, reputational harm, loss of business opportunities, or loss of customer
and/or investor confidence, each of which individually or in the aggregate could adversely affect
our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Section 3 Risk Management: Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages
climate-related risks.

Response:

As stated above, we consider risk management an integral part of our business strategy and a key
element of our approach to corporate governance. We have an integrated process for managing
risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. The Corebridge
Board has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Management has the day-to-day
responsibility for assessing and managing Corebridge’s risk exposure, and the Corebridge Board
and the Corebridge Audit Committee provide oversight in connection with those efforts, with
particular focus on reviewing Corebridge’s most significant existing and emerging risks. Such
oversight is in addition to the oversight of the Corebridge Nominating and Governance
Committee’s oversight of issues of significance relating to climate, as described above in the
response to Section 1.

Corebridge’s investment strategies involve considerations that include local and general market
and economic conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility

constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax, regulatory and legal
investment limitations, and, as applicable, climate and other related, considerations.

‘We manage operational risk related to climate through, among other things, our business resiliency
program. Our program and policies address planning for the business continuity of operations,
disaster recovery of technology infrastructure and event management, including incident response
and crisis management before, during and after possible disruptions.

Additionally, as part of our strategy, we continue to monitor evolving expectations from investors,
customers, regulators and other stakeholders, including in connection with climate-related risk.
Section 4 Metrics and Targets: Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage
relevant collateralized risks and opportunities where such information is material.
Response:

As Corebridge has become a stand-alone business, we expect to further assess and evaluate
climate-related risks, including consideration of whether and which metrics might assist in
assessing and managing relevant risks and opportunities.

For applicable responses to close-ended questions, please see the relevant sections above.

Background & Scope
This document contains the written response to the NAIC Climate Risk Survey, for Reporting Year 2022
(“Survey”) for Thrivent Financial for Lutherans (“Thrivent”), as adopted by the “climate risk disclosure”
workstream of the NAIC’s Climate Risk and Resilience Executive Committee Task Force.
While the Minnesota Department of Commerce is Thrivent's point-of-contact for the survey, the survey is also
being conducted in cooperation with many other state insurance departments’.
In addition to the written response, Thrivent has responded to all closed-ended questions provided in the
survey. Those responses are provided both electronically (via the link provided by the Minnesota Department
of Commerce) and are included in this document in the section titled ‘Responses to Closed-Ended Questions’
Thrivent is organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin and complies with Internal Revenue Code
Section 501(c)(8). Thrivent is licensed to sell insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a
fraternal benefit society, Thrivent serves clients who share a common bond of Christianity. Thrivent has no
shareholders, but rather is operated for the benefit of its membership.
In Thrivent's legal structure, the parent entity is the fraternal benefit society known as Thrivent Financial for
Lutherans. As such, a single uniform group response is being provided to the survey. Beneath the parent is a
subsidiary holding company known as Thrivent Financial Holdings, Inc.(“Holdings’) Beneath Holdings is a
collection of subsidiaries, and each of the subsidiaries was established either to provide products and services
that, by law, the fraternal benefit society cannot directly offer, or for other strategic purposes. An abbreviated
organizational chart is shown below.

Executive Summary

Thrivent is a Fortune 500 financial services organization offering holistic advice, investments, insurance,
banking and generosity solutions to millions of clients every year. For over a century, the organization has
helped people meet their financial goals and lead lives of service and faith. Thrivent's broad insurance
offerings include individual life insurance, health insurance, and annuity solutions but does not include property
and casualty (“P&C”) insurance offerings. As such, climate change is currently viewed as an emerging risk.
Emerging risks are defined as those risks which are developing but cannot yet be fully or confidently assessed
so as to require immediate management and mitigation but that could, in the future, potentially affect the
organization in a material way. In classifying a risk as emerging, consideration is given to risk velocity (i.e.,
rate of change / time horizon of potential impact), likelihood, and materiality.

The organization's current assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities spans four key dimensions.

* Our trusted reputation: Serving the unique needs of our clients is central to our mission, and the
actual or perceived failure to adequately address climate-related needs or expectations of our clients
could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of those valued relationships.

* Pricing/underwriting risks and opportunities: Significant changes in mortality or morbidity could
emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, including climate change, the
health habits of the insured population, effectiveness of treatment for disease or disability, or other
factors.

= Macroeconomic environment: Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution, resulting in a gradual increase in
global average temperatures. These trends are expected to continue in the future and have the
potential to affect nearly all sectors of the economy to varying degrees.

* Regulatory and compliance: Changes and uncertainty in U.S. and non-U.S. legislation, policy or
regulation regarding climate risk management or other Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
practices may result in higher regulatory costs, compliance costs and increased capital expenditures.
Physical risks and transitional risks could increase Thrivent's cost of doing business.

As an emerging risk, the potential future effects of climate change on Thrivent’s business model and

strategy are being contemplated and monitored but are intentionally not yet being actively managed or

mitigated. That said, Thrivent continues to make strides in refining our understanding of the impact and
reach of climate-related risks across our businesses, including:

* Implementing a cross functional ESG team at the management level to continue maturation of
enterprise strategy, including climate risk and sustainability, with a focus on assessment of current
state.

* Baselining our Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) under the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol for
Scope 1 (owned and controlled sources) and Scope 2 (indirect via purchased energy) emissions.

* Providing additional transparency into elements of Scope 3 (other indirect via financed) emissions
using data from Thrivent’s General Account investment holdings.

This approach balances the need to be forward-looking in our understanding and planning while being

good stewards of the expense and resources necessary to manage or mitigate any risk.

Governance
41. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
In disclosing the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities insurers should
consider including the following:

* Identify and include any publicly stated goals on climate-related risk and opportunities.

* Describe where climate-related disclosures is handled within the insurer's structure, @.g., at a
group level, entity level, or a combination. If handled at the group level, describe what activities
are undertaken at the company level.

A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks
and opportunities.

In describing the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing

the climate-related financial risks, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of
managing the climate-related financial risks.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and
opportunities.

Survey Response — Governance
The Board of Directors sets the tone at the top of the organization with regard to all risk management.
Risk management is embedded in strategic planning and capital allocation, and these processes
require the Board's review and approval via the risk appetite statement and strategic plan.
Specific to climate-related risks, the Human Resource / Governance Committee of the Board is
responsible for overseeing the management of ESG risks and opportunities and receives periodic
updates. Climate-related risks fall under Environmental. The Investment Committee is responsible for
overseeing the general account investment portfolio, capital management, and asset liability and
product management. As part of its risk oversight responsibilities, the committee monitors risks inherent
in the product portfolio, which may be impacted by climate. The Audit Committee of the Board is
responsible for overseeing the financial impact of all risks in Thrivent's Enterprise Risk Management
risk taxonomy, as well as considering the longer-term potential impact of emerging risks (such as those
related to climate). The Audit Committee provides active oversight of the organization's key risks.
At the management level, risk and opportunity management is overseen and administered by Thrivent's
Risk Management Committee (“RMC""). The RMC establishes the enterprise risk framework, identifies
key risks, facilitates ongoing risk management activities at all levels and provides regular reports to the
Board, through the Audit Committee. The RMC members are appointed by the Audit Committee of the
Board. The RMC is composed primarily of Thrivent’s executive leadership team and the head of
Business Risk Management. The RMC is chaired by the EVP, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel
and Secretary. The RMC reports to the Board with respect to identifying key risks and facilitating
ongoing risk management activities.
Thrivent does not currently have any publicly stated goals on climate-risk and related opportunities.
Consistent with the management of other risks and opportunities at Thrivent, climate-related
disclosures - including this survey and the related disclosures - are ultimately handled at the group
level. Climate risk disclosures within individual legal entities would only consist of those required by a
unique regulatory or compliance need of the individual company that did not apply more broadly at the
group level.

Strategy
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the
insurer's businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
businesses, strategy, and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate
risk and resiliency.
* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its
operations or organizations.
A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
medium, and long term.
In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
medium, and long term, insurers should consider including the following:
* Describe short, medium, and long term, if different that 1-5 years as short term, 5-10 years
as medium term, and 10-30 years as long-term.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business,
strategy, and financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business, strategy,
and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low
carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-
related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
8

Survey Response - Strategy
As noted previously, the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities spans
four key dimensions.

* Our trusted reputation: Serving the unique needs of our clients is central to our mission, and
the actual or perceived failure to adequately address climate-related needs or expectations of
our clients could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of those valued relationships.

*  Pricing/underwriting risks and opportunities: Significant changes in mortality or morbidity
could emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, including climate
change, the health habits of the insured population, effectiveness of treatment for disease or
disability, or other factors.

= Macroeconomic environment: Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution, resulting in a
gradual increase in global average temperatures. These trends are expected to continue in the
future and have the potential to affect nearly all sectors of the economy to varying degrees.

«Regulatory and compliance: Changes and uncertainty in U.S. and non-U.S. legislation, policy
or regulation regarding climate risk management or other ESG practices may result in higher
regulatory costs, compliance costs and increased capital expenditures. Physical risks and
transitional risks could increase Thrivent's cost of doing business.

Reputational and regulatory and compliance risks and opportunities are viewed as short to medium
term (i.e., 1 to 10 years) whereas pricing/underwriting and macroeconomic risk and opportunities are
viewed as medium to long-term (i.e., 5 to 30 years).

In the near-term, operationally, Thrivent's focus is on continued maturation of its enterprise ESG
strategy, including climate risk and sustainability, with a focus on assessment of current state.

This positions us well to address risks and opportunities if/when they arise. Assessment includes both
building new capabilities - such as the scope 1 and 2 CCF analysis - as well as continuing to refine
existing techniques. Currently, the potential for longer-term financial impacts in this space are
considered via robust sensitivity and stress testing.

Thrivent tests a climate scenario in which there are high physical and transition risks in the next three

years: implementation of a carbon tax as well as global supply chain disruptions that spike interest

rates and cause a large reinsurer to default. Additionally, Thrivent does sensitivity and stress test
scenarios where other potential climate-related externalities are considered. Specifically, extreme shifts
in expected mortality and morbidity, macroeconomic disruption, reputational events, and changes to

U.S. legislation, policy, and regulation are tested. The results of these assessments are used to inform
the financial viability of Thrivent's current business strategy via the organization's Own Risk & Solvency
Assessment (ORSA) and demonstrates a high level of resiliency.

In addition to maturing our internal knowledge and capabilities for assessing climate-related risks and
opportunities, as appropriate, Thrivent has taken some initial steps to engage key constituencies on this
topic. Examples are provided below.

* Board of Directors: Board of Directors receives periodic updates on reports, actions and disclosures
that have broad ESG content (such as Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure, WI Fraternal
Expenditures Report, Insurance Holding Company Annual Registration Statement, Community

9

thrivent
Impact Report, Annual Report to Members, among others). The Human Resource / Governance
Committee also receives periodic reports on Thrivent's overall approach to ESG.

* Senior Management: Senior management receives periodic updates on actions that have a material
environmental and economic impact (such as a new or remodeled facility that saved significant
amounts of energy, water, and money). In addition, senior management also receives periodic
reports on reports, actions and disclosures that have broad ESG content (see above).

Industry Trade Groups: Thrivent is an active member and participant of the American Council of Life
Insurers (ACLI) which occasionally engages policymakers on this topic.

‘Life insurers are committed to working with policymakers on climate change and are already
making headway. For example, as new products enter the market many life insurers allow
policyholders to choose sustainable investments for their Separate Account policies. And life
‘insurers are actively involved in efforts to close the coverage gap for historically disenfranchised
populations economically impacted by climate change with an array of targeted products and
investments.” — ACLI, December 2021.

* Rating Agencies: During annual discussions with Thrivent's credit rating agencies (Moody's
Investors Service, Standard & Poor's, and AM Best) ESG is discussed, which includes some
elements of environmental risk. Rating agencies have begun to publish high-level commentary in
this space.

“Thrivent Financial for Lutherans faces moderate environmental risks. The group has moderate
exposure to carbon transition risk through the long-duration assets held in its investment
portfolio and inherent asset leverage, while emerging stakeholder focus on environmental
stewardship in its investment portfolio gives rise to strategic and reputational risk. This risk is
mitigated by the group's portfolio risk management capabilities and its developing focus on
managing climate risk.” - Moody's Investors Service, May 2023

* 2023 Materiality Assessment: In addition to these periodic updates and reports, in Q4 2023,
Thrivent conducted a Materiality Assessment to identify and prioritize ESG topics that may be
important to our company and our stakeholders. For this assessment, we defined material issues as
those that are important to our stakeholders or those that our stakeholders perceive as important to
Thrivent. This definition does not coincide with the definition of materiality used in U.S. securities
laws. We received survey responses from almost 300 stakeholders, including financial advisors,
members, employees, and members of our Board of Directors and Executive Leadership Team. As
part of this assessment, we received quantitative and qualitative feedback from stakeholders on
issues such as:

o Climate Change

o Electrification & Grid Resilience
o Emissions & Air Quality

o Energy Efficiency

To help support the transition to a low carbon economy, Thrivent has made some investments over

time to reduce its own environmental footprint, though this has not been a primary area of focus.

Examples include employee benefits (e.g., commuter benefits such as subsidized public transportation

passes, bicycle storage, and expense reimbursement), workforce management policies (e.g., Thrivent

offers a hybrid work environment that enables on-site, mobile, and remote work modes), and corporate
10

facilities (e.g., a new Minneapolis corporate headquarters was recently built which is two-thirds the size
of the previous 40-year-old building and incorporates 100% LED lighting).
These initiatives are viewed as part of broader value proposition to current and future employees
necessary to retain and attract talent, and not solely for the purpose of advancing sustainability or
addressing climate-related risks and opportunities.
While not specific to climate-risk, Thrivent also currently offers a Small-Mid Cap ESG Exchange Traded
Fund (ETF) where investments target companies with demonstrated commitment to ESG policies,
practices or outcomes. Environment factors including climate risks and opportunities - among others -
are considered to as part of the investment process. See prospectus for additional details, risks, and
disclosures.

Risk Management
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers should
consider including the following:

* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting
portfolio, and the how the company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to
physical, transition and liability risk.

* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential
physical and transition climate related risks, if applicable.

* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment
Portfolio, including what investment classes have been considered.

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers should
consider including the following:

* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how
frequently the process is completed.

B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.

C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management.

In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are

integrated into the insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the following:

* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's general enterprise-
risk management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what
timeframes are considered.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments,
including which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what time frames
are considered.

Survey Response — Risk Management
There is a strong organizational ethos for identifying, assessing, and managing risk. Risk identification
and escalation is rooted in Thrivent's culture and is a shared responsibility of all employees. Ultimately
though, Thrivent’s Risk Management Committee is accountable for identifying material and relevant
risks.
Thrivent has a documented risk taxonomy with formal definitions for each material and relevant risk that
is being actively managed at the organization. Risks are assessed on a top-down basis for impact,
likelihood and velocity by the Risk Management Committee. Thrivent's Business Risk Management
group also provides a bottoms-up perspective to the risk assessment as a result of interactions with
business and process owners throughout the organization. Assessments occur quarterly.
Emerging risks, such as climate-related risks, are identified during strategic and business discussions,
and as part of the strategic planning process, by scanning the external environment, providing early
warning about topics and risks not yet captured in Thrivent's risk taxonomy and ranking new topics of
strategic importance for potential inclusion and more active management. Thrivent is currently
formalizing a semi-annual emerging risk process. While climate risk is viewed as emerging, Thrivent
does acknowledge its potential long-term effects on mortality and morbidity experience within its risk
management framework and processes.
*  Thrivent's formal definition of mortality risk (emphasis added):
Risk that the actual future mortality rates will be substantially greater (e.g., life insurance) or less
than (immediate annuities, LTC) those assumed in setting prices. This includes risk of death
due to changes in the natural environment, including climate change, the health habits of
the insured population, effectiveness of treatment for disease or disability, pandemics, and
catastrophic events.
*  Thrivent's formal definition of morbidity risk (emphasis added):
Risk that the actual future benefit payments as the result of disability, sickness, or serious
illness will be substantially greater than those assumed in setting prices. The risk could include
higher incidents (more claims than expected) or higher severity (each claim costs more than
expected). This includes risk of the abovementioned conditions due to changes in the natural
environment, including climate change, the health habits of the insured population,
effectiveness of treatment for disease or disability, pandemics, and catastrophic events.
As discussed in the strategy section of this survey, sensitivity testing and stress testing (e.g., on
mortality and morbidity assumptions) is performed annually to more broadly consider the financial
viability of Thrivent's current business strategy via the organization's Own Risk & Solvency Assessment
(ORSA). Monitoring trends (e.g., actual vs. expected mortality and morbidity experience) and exposure
(e.g., geographic concentration of risk) is performed quarterly. In this way, the long-term potential
financial impacts in pricing/underwriting from large changes in experience are being considered while
also watching for near-term deviations in experience that could signal a shift in the velocity and/or
likelihood of the risk.
With respect to Thrivent's investment portfolio, climate-change is just one element of a broader
Responsible Investing philosophy. Thrivent believes active management can produce favorable returns
13

thrivent

for our clients over the long term. Further, we believe success in active management depends on
having skilled investment professionals, supported by rigorous investment processes.
TAM strives to take all relevant information into consideration when making investment decisions.
Relevant information may include certain environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria,
including information related to climate risks and opportunities, which may be utilized and weighted
differently by each portfolio manager and may be used to inform investment decisions. While such
considerations may be applied in varying degrees by our portfolio managers and aren't required for
non-ESG funds, we believe that certain factors, when considered with a range of other financial criteria,
have the potential to bolster returns and reduce investment risk.
Thrivent incorporates various factors beyond traditional financial metrics—including ESG factors—to
varying degrees across asset classes, including equity, fixed income and private assets. The approach
to integrating these factors is determined by the specific investment process of the investment team
within the underlying asset class. Integration of material financial and non-financial factors into our
investment process starts with the initial research as an investment idea is formed and continues
through the life of the investment. The process of incorporating various factors beyond traditional
financial metrics into our investment analyses and decisions takes place on two levels: first, with our
research analysts as they identify investment opportunities and second, with the portfolio managers as
they assess risk exposures at the portfolio level. The analysts and portfolio managers leverage in-
house expertise as well as third-party data and research.
Thrivent maintains an ESG & Proxy Voting Committee which, in addition to establishing our proxy
voting policies and procedures, provides oversight of evolving environmental, social and governance
risks, including those related to climate change. The committee meets at least quarterly to review
portfolio metrics and research coverage, relevant updates regarding risks and potential areas of
concern, as well as general trends. As part of our oversight process, we monitor, review and evaluate
controversial issuers, activities and developments. The committee seeks to understand potential
controversies more clearly and ensure that the potential risks are thoroughly considered. The
committee also monitors changes in conditions, regulatory developments and broader industry trends
related to environmental, social and governance issues to prompt special review.
Other physical and transition risks outside of underwriting and investment are also managed through
stress testing their impacts in ORSA. Thrivent considers the short-term risks in the table below:

Emissions pricing, enhanced reporting Increased expenses

requirements or regulation, investment in new

technology, increased cost of raw materials

and other changing customer behavior
Climate-related opportunities were addressed in the Strategy section.
Beyond the abovementioned governance processes, general monitoring, and assessment techniques
described herein, climate-risk management has not been a key area of focus at Thrivent historically;
rather, this risk receives similar consideration as other emerging risks facing the organization.
Accordingly, at this time, Thrivent has not overtly engaged its clients on the topic of managing potential
physical and/or transition risks related to climate. However, should the need arise, as a purpose-based
advice company, the company is well positioned to reach and educate clients on a myriad of risk topics.

Metrics and Targets
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:

* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your
business. Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to
assess, if any.

A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in
line with its strategy and risk management process.

In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line

with its strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:

* In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate
scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the
amount of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
and the related risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities
and performance against targets.
15

Survey Response - Metrics and Targets
All insurance underwriting activities utilize current best estimate assumptions and are not aligned with
any particular climate scenario. However, Thrivent monitors both short- and long-term climate-related
metrics. Longer-term metrics related to physical risk, such as sensitivity and stress testing of mortality
and morbidity assumptions, consider the impact to capital (both in dollar amounts and to risk-adjusted
capital ratios), earnings, and embedded value. In the short-term, performance of mortality and morbidity
metrics are tracked relative to risk tolerances. As part of good corporate stewardship, Thrivent also
tracks its water use, land use, waste costs, and monitors climate-related opportunity metrics, such as
the use of commuter benefits and in-office vs. remote employee counts.
Thrivent does not offer P&C insurance, and so it does not utilize traditional catastrophe modeling.
Catastrophe modeling is commonly used in that market to develop metrics and to assess climate-
related risks.
Scope 1 & Scope 2 Emissions
Shorter-term metrics used to assess the current state of climate-related risks and opportunities align
with established methods of reporting Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions. Specifically,
Thrivent calculates GHG emissions through the GHG Protocol's Corporate Standard for Scope 1 and
Scope 2 that uses carbon dioxide equivalent (COze). We establish our boundaries by owned and
controlled leased properties within Thrivent Financial Holdings, Inc. Scope 1 includes stationary
combustion and fleet vehicles, and Scope 2 was calculated using a location-based methodology. With
the near-term focus on assessing current state, Thrivent does not currently have specific targets nor
tracking of performance vs. stated goals for climate-related risks and opportunities for the above
metrics. The most recent assessment of Scope 1 and 2 emissions are provided in the table below.
eee ee
While the emissions metrics above show a modest level of reduction from 2019 to 2021, this was
influenced significantly by two events; one, completing construction in 2020 of a new Minneapolis
corporate headquarters which is two-thirds the size of the previous building, and two, much less facility
use by employees who were working remotely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-
2021). In general, the new Minneapolis corporate headquarters, in comparison to the prior building,
uses a similar amount of gas (which comes through Scope 1) but much less electricity (which comes
through Scope 2). The reductions from 2022 to 2023 stem from closing off sections of the (mostly
unused) Appleton corporate building and the lower need for heating over the mild winter.
Scope 3 Emissions
Thrivent recognizes the significance of measuring and managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
including Scope 3 emissions in Category 15: Financed Emissions. To effectively assess emissions from
‘equity holdings, Thrivent adopts the non-control method recommended by the GHG Protocol. Under this
approach, emissions are determined by calculating Thrivent's proportional share of the investee
16

company's Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. This calculation is based on the market value of Thrivent's
general account holding divided by the issuer's Enterprise Value Including Cash (EVIC). Similarly,
emissions from debt holdings are evaluated as a proportion share determined by market value of holdings
divided by EVIC.
In the context of our general account, which encompasses various asset classes such as public and
private equities, debt, structured notes, asset-backed securities, sovereign bonds, and private church
loans, financed emissions primarily originate. To obtain data regarding these emissions, Thrivent relies
‘on MSCI It is important to note that the avaiable data from currently covers only a portion of our general
account assets. This is primarily due to certain types of securities where emissions data does not exist
or entities that do not report their emissions information.

In alignment with the GHG Protocol's guidance for Scope 3 - Category 15: Financed Emissions,
Thrivent's ‘Total Emissions’ for Scope 3 are simply the total of Thrivent's proportional share of investee
companies’ Scope 1 & 2 emissions (i.e., Thrivent’s proportional “share” of emissions from the underlying
investments, given the data). As described earlier, proportionality is determined using market value of
the investments divided by Enterprise Value Including Cash (EVIC). The units for emissions are in metric
tons of COve.
As seen in the preceding tables, the Scope 3 intensity (Thrivent's financed emissions in metric tons CO2e
divided by the market value of holdings) has decreased y-o-y since 2020. However, itis worth noting that
the data covers only those issuers where emissions data and EVIC data are available . As a result of
7

these data issues described, financed emissions are an estimate that captures a portion of our total actual
financed emissions, though we anticipate this data will get more robust in terms of coverage over time.
Consistent with NAIC survey instructions and intentions, all metrics disclosed in this document represent
a ‘best-efforts’ calculation based on data available at the time of submission and Thrivent'’s current
understanding of the underlying methodologies.
See Appendix for additional notes on financed emissions.

In responding to climate change, which poses a global social issue critical to human history and
important for Tokio Marine Group, our Group promote initiatives toward achieving carbon
neutrality by 2050 in keeping with the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of
leaving no one behind and based on constructive dialogue (engagement) with all of our
stakeholders. As an insurance business operator (insurance products and services), institutional
investor and asset manager, Tokio Marine Group provide support both in terms of mitigating and
adapting to climate change and help customers and investment and financing recipients solve
their respective issues. Efforts include providing insurance products and services to support the
transition to a decarbonized society, such as those promoting the more widespread use of
renewable energy; providing insurance to cover damages caused by natural disasters; services that
will lead to prevention or reduction of damages; and undertaking sustainable investment and
financing.
As a global company, Tokio Marine Group also take climate action through collaboration and
cooperation with international and other organizations. Tokio Marine Group intend to contribute
to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change and seek growth together with our
stakeholders. Social contribution activities are also key to climate action. As such activities, Tokio
Marine Group plant mangroves and engage in research and educational activities to increase
society's resilience, thereby contributing to climate action as a good corporate citizen in local
communities.
Recognition of Risks and Opportunities
Ina strategy, recognizing inherent risks is essential. Tokio Marine Group assumes a rise in climate-
related risks and accordingly identifies and evaluates their impact on our business. Climate-related
risks include physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks arise from an increase in the frequency
and intensity of natural disasters caused by climate change, while transition risks result from the
impacts of the transition to a decarbonized society on the corporate value of investee companies
and assets held by us. On the other hand, initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change also
provide business opportunities for Tokio Marine Group. In the table below, we show examples of
events for each risk and opportunity based on the TCFD recommendations and examples of risks
and opportunities to the Group's business activities.
Examples of Events ~ Physical Risks
‘* Acute - Potential for growing frequency and scale of typhoons, floods, and other weather
events.
* Chronic - Rising temperatures. Other weather changes, such as droughts and heat waves.
Rising sea level rise. Impact on arthropod-borne infectious diseases
Examples of Events - Transition Risks
‘* Policies & Regulations ~ Increase in carbon prices. Strengthening of environmental-related
regulations and standards. Increase in climate-related legislation.
* Technology - Technological innovation toward the transition to a decarbonized society.
‘+ Market - Changes in the demand for and supply of products & services.

Policies Concerning Insurance Underwriting as well as Investment and Financing
Tokio Marine Group's basic policy on climate change is to support the decarbonization of
customers and local communities through insurance products and services as well as investments
and financing while basing our activities on constructive dialogue with stakeholders. For
investment and financing fields that could cause significant, negative impacts on the environment
or society, Tokio Marine Group individually set up a policy on each transaction.
At the end of September 2020, Tokio Marine Group published our thoughts on climate change in
""Tokio Marine: Our Climate Strategy,” which we revised at the end of September 2021 and the end
of September 2022. The following sections describe our policies concerning insurance
underwriting as well as investment and financing to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
{Insurance Underwriting)
Tokio Marine Group has not provided new insurance underwriting capacities to coal-fired power
generation projects since September 2020 or thermal coal mining projects since September 2021,
regardless of whether they are newly constructed or not. However, Tokio Marine Group may grant
exceptions for projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS” and
mixed combustion, aiming to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, after careful consideration.
Since September 2022, Tokio Marine Group has also strengthened its commitment by protecting

5

the environment and supporting the transition to a decarbonized society by no longer providing
new insurance underwriting capacities to oil and gas company extraction projects” in the Arctic
Circle (all areas north of latitude 66°33, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR) and
oil sands mining.
1 Carbon dioxide capture and storage/Carbon dioxide capture utilization, and storage
+2 Exemptions for projects with decarbonization plans that are aligned with the Paris Agreement
[Investment and Financing)
With respect to investment and financing, Tokio Marine Group will not provide new financing for
coal-fired power generation projects or thermal coal mining projects. However, as with our
insurance underwriting policy, Tokio Marine Group may grant exceptions for projects with
innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS and mixed combustion, aiming to
achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, after careful consideration.
In aligning with our insurance underwriting policy, Tokio Marine Group also no longer provide new
financing for oil and gas extraction projects in the Arctic Circle (all areas north of latitude 66°33,
including the ANWR) and oil sands mining and are stepping up our efforts to support the
protection of the natural environment and transition to a decarbonized society.
[Underwriting Management Process)
Tokio Marine Group has established a strict underwriting management process for specific sectors
that we deem to pose a high risk to the environment and society. For projects that relate to any of
the specific sectors but may be subject to special consideration*3, we determine whether to
underwrite insurance by using an escalation process, through which a dedicated team will perform
risk assessments. We seek the approval of the Sustainability Committee if necessary.
In fiscal 2023, we received inquiries for four projects in the specific sectors. Of these, three were
deemed eligible and underwent an assessment by the dedicated team.
*3 Projects with innovative technologies and approaches, such as CCS/CCUS and mixed combustion which contribute to achieving the goals set
in the Paris Agreement, and projects conducted by companies wth decarbonizaton pans aligned with the Pais Agreement will be caretuly
decided ater analyzing thee ESG risks.

Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. TCED Report 2024 p33
Strategies to address Climate Change at the US entity level
TMA has initiated steps to address climate change risk with its clients. TMA loss control engineers
consult with clients on disaster resiliency including building design, green materials, supply chain
management and business continuity planning. As customers transition their operations to
mitigate climate change, TMA engineers consult on safety practices surrounding changes in
manufacturing and storage operations such as electric batteries.

6

Short-term opportunities to address climate-related risks include offering products and services to
support the transition to a decarbonized society. Short-term climate-related risks include
potential regulatory changes and accurately understanding new technologies, assessing risk and
developing policies and practices to mitigate loss. Over the medium to long term, an
intensification of natural disasters is predicted. This presents TMA with portfolio management and
pricing risks, as traditional modeling and pricing techniques are primarily based on historical data.
TMA’s climate strategy includes offering products to companies that contribute to renewable
energy development and providing services that assist customers in mitigating risks. This enables
TMA to retain customers as they transition their operations, as well as grow business through new
markets, products and services. This includes opportunities arising from:

‘* The construction of new plants to support technology changes (e.g. electric batteries) and
an increased demand for green buildings.

‘* Expanding TMA writings, solely or in partnership with other Group companies, to support
renewable energy power generation companies.

* Development of new pre and post loss services for both loss prevention and risk
mitigation.

TMA’s investment risk policy states the following regarding ESG including climate change risk:

+ The Company shall not make loans to finance any of the following types of projects: (i)
coal-fired power generation, (ii) thermal coal mining, (ii) oil sands mining, or (iv) oil and
gas mining in the Arctic region.

‘+ The Company shall not make loans to, nor other investments in, any company that is
named in the list of inhumane weapons manufacturers, or other list of companies in which
investments are prohibited, as issued and updated by Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. from
time to time.

* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its
underwriting portfolio, and how the company is managing its underwriting exposure
with respect to physical, transition and liability risk.*

* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their
potential physical and transition climate related risks, if applicable.*

* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its
investment portfolio, including what investment classes have been considered.*

how frequently the process is completed.*
B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related
risks are integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management.
In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management, insurers should consider including the
following:

* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's
general enterprise-risk management process or a separate process and how
frequently the process is completed.

© Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its
underwriting risks, including which risk factors the scenarios consider, what
types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are considered.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its
investments, including which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios
are used, and what timeframes are considered.

Managing Climate-Related Risk Based on Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
TMHD conducts enterprise risk management (ERM), which includes the management of climate
risks. Through the ERM cycle, TMHD comprehensively identifies and assesses risks, using both
qualitative and quantitative approaches.
In the insurance underwriting business, which pursues profit through risk-taking, risk assessment is
the foundation of the Group's business. TMHD has been working for many years to assess material
risks (including those due to natural disasters) both quantitatively and qualitatively. Specific

8

initiatives are as follows.
(1) Qualitative Risk Management
TMHD identify all forms of risks comprehensively, including those for natural disasters such as large
wind/flood and emerging risks due to environmental changes. Of these risks, TMHD define risks that
will have an extremely large impact on Group's financial soundness and business continuity as
“material risks.” TMHD include the wind/flood risks (including climate change physical risks) in the
""material risks” category, which could become more frequent and severe due to the effects of climate
change. For these material risks, TMHD also formulate control measures prior to risk emergence and
response measures for after risks occur.
(2) Quantitative Risk Management
For material risks, through measuring risk amounts and implementing stress tests as part of the
TMHD’s quantitative risk management, TMHD performs a multifaceted review of the adequacy of
capital relative to the risks held for the purpose of maintaining ratings and preventing bankruptcy.
TMHD calculates risk amounts posed by natural disasters using a risk model (for Japan, a risk model
developed in-house based on engineering theory and the latest knowledge of natural disasters, and
for overseas, models provided by outside vendors). TMHD independently analyzes past tropical
cyclones (typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United States), torrential rains, and other changing
trends and incorporate this data as necessary in order to properly assess current weather
phenomena
Furthermore, within material risks, TMHD conducts stress tests based on scenarios in which extreme
economic losses are expected and scenarios where multiple material risks occur at the same time. As
for risks involving major wind and flood disasters, for example, TMHD assumes these scenarios to be
‘ona much larger scale than the major typhoons that hit the Greater Tokyo Area in 2018 and 2019
causing extensive damages. TMHD updates scenarios continuously while taking into account stress
tests released by regulatory authorities of every country, the latest knowledge (including that of
climate change), and recent case studies.
Appropriately Control Risk through Risk Diversification and Reinsurance, etc.
Natural disasters are inevitable in Japan, the Group's home market. For that reason, TMHD has
sought to control risk capital by geographic, business, and product risk diversification through M&A
overseas.
In addition, reinsurance, as a hedge against risk, is also an effective way to protect the Group's capital
and stabilize profits. The Group utilizes reinsurance to prepare for natural disasters (capital events)
that occur once every few centuries, and TMHD determines earnings coverage from the standpoint of
economic rationality and take necessary measures.
Acquisition of Knowledge (e.g., Industry-Academia Collaboration)
TMHD is deepening collaboration with both inside and outside experts to acquire knowledge about
risks. Tokio Marine Research Institute collaborates with The University of Tokyo, Nagoya University,
and Kyoto University, among others, to carry out impact analysis based on the possibility for
increased insurance losses associated with natural disasters that are becoming more severe in nature.

9

Moreover, Tokio Marine dR and a team of experts in natural disasters working in Atlanta, the United
States, are leading efforts to upgrade natural disaster risk management across the entire Group,
including various evaluations of natural disaster risk models.

Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. TCFD Report 2024 p38
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) at the US Entity Level
The ERM cycle at the US entity level dovetails with the process disclosed for TMHD. The evaluation
of key risks such as climate change is outlined in TMNA‘s Risk Management Policy. From a
qualitative risk viewpoint, Emerging Risks are defined as newly developing or changing risks or risks
already known or managed, but whose magnitude on the organization is growing in unexpected
ways. Once identified, Emerging Risks are included in the Emerging Risk Inventory for further
exploration. Climate Change Risk is part of the current Emerging Risk Inventory and discussed
frequently with stakeholders throughout the TMNA GCs, as well as quarterly in the TMNA and TMA
ESG Committee meetings. Climate Change Risk has been elevated into a category for deeper
evaluation and formal inclusion into the TMNA quantified economic capital assessment.
From a quantitative risk viewpoint, Underwriting Risk contributes a significant amount of risk to
TMNA's required overall economic capital. As a subset of Underwriting Risk, Natural Catastrophe
Risk is evaluated quarterly by the TMNA ERM function for TMA. External models (Risk Management
Solutions, Inc. (RMS) and AIR Verisk) are used in conjunction with internal capital modeling to
evaluate natural catastrophe exposure including earthquakes, floods, wildfires, hurricanes and
convective storms (tornado, hail and straight line winds). For capital modeling, risk is quantified
using the 99% Tail Value at Risk (TVaR) metric.
TMNA performs annual stress tests as part of its ORSA, which includes a multi-factor stress scenario
designed to test resiliency of the organization to deteriorating underwriting performance and
heightened natural catastrophe losses. For the 2023 ORSA, TMNA also performed an independent
evaluation of both the PRA 2019 US Hurricane Scenarios A and B and the Bank of England's 2021
Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario for purposes of evaluating the impact of climate change risk in
comparison to the aforementioned stress scenario. TMNA leveraged analyses performed by TMHD's
Risk Management Department (RMD) for these scenarios on TMA specific exposure. Based on this
review, TMNA concluded that the existing stress scenario reasonably contemplated the impact of
increased physical risks associated with climate change over the planning period.
The TMA underwriting and pricing process addresses both physical and transition risks supported by
loss control engineering visits and catastrophe modeling. Building characteristics, building code
effectiveness, inflation and supply chain management are incorporated into the underwriting process.
Key processes at TMA for managing climate-related risks include:
+ Optimizing the TMA portfolio. Specifically, TMA revised its underwriting policy to support reduced
GHG emissions through the prohibition of coal fired power plants and oil mining while focusing on
renewable power generation companies.
+ Risk diversification
+ Further strengthening TMA business and ERM platforms to respond to increasingly diverse and
complex risks such as those created by more severe natural disasters.

Achieving Carbon Neutrality in Fiscal 2022

reduction vs 2015)
(Scope 1: 13,362 tons; Scope 2: 41,190 tons; Scope 3°: 25,649 tons)

© Amount of GHG (CO2) Fixed and Reduced 93,000 tons
Tokio Marine Group is working to reduce the environmental impact of the overall Group (domestic and
overseas) and become carbon neutral by 1) conserving energy and using energy more efficiently, 2)
planting mangroves to absorb and fix CO2, 3) using natural energy (such as by procuring green electricity) and
4) amortizing carbon credits. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2022 we achieved carbon neutrality for the
tenth consecutive year (since fiscal 2013) thanks to absorption and fixation effects of mangrove planting
and the use of carbon credits outperforming the CO2 emissions generated by the Group's overall business
activities. The value of ecosystem services generated through the Mangrove Planting Project from April 1999
to the end of March 2022 has reached approximately 202.4 billion yen. We expect the value to climb to 3912
billion yen by the end of fiscal 2038. As of March 31, 2024, we have planted a total area of 12,567 hectares of
mangrove forest.

Measures against Climate Change at US Entity Level
TMNA supports TMHD in attaining its global sustainability goals over the medium to long term. At the
GC level, TMA is at the early stages of developing metrics to assess the impact of physical and transition
risks associated with climate change.
As noted in response to question 3, catastrophe risk models are used to evaluate potential losses due to
2

natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. TMHD's multidisciplinary team of data and modeling experts in
Natural Catastrophe Risk Research & Development (part of RMD) have performed research to assess the
impact of climate change on physical risks affecting natural catastrophes. Specific physical risk impacts
evaluated include: 1) increase in frequency of major hurricanes; 2) uniform increase in wind speed of
major hurricanes; 3) tropical cyclone-induced flooding; and 4) storm surge/sea level rise. This research
has been ongoing since 2020 for the major GCs of TMHD, including TMA. As previously noted, risk is
quantified for natural catastrophes using the 99% Tail Value at Risk (TVaR) metric. TMA is coordinating
with TMHD to develop additional risk metrics for assessing climate change risk.
For Fiscal YE 2023, TMA Scope 1, Scope 2, and partial Scope 3 emissions CO2 equivalent metric tons
(MtCO2e) are shown below:
Scope 1: 151
Scope 2: 238
Scope 3:

Business Travel ~ 395

Employee Commute ~ 355

Procurement - 675
TMNA has partnered with an external vendor to verify the completeness and accuracy of TMA’s Scope 1
and 2 inventory, as well as derive partial Scope 3 estimates. The inventory was conducted with the best
available data to date and is using assumptions approved by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Note that REC
offsets for TMA’s electricity usage are not reflected in estimates presented, and Scope 1 mobile
combustion is not included in the inventory due to data limitations.
TMA has partnered with Terrapass since 2014 to purchase renewable energy in the form of wind credits.
Terrapass funds projects that destroy greenhouse gases and produce renewable energy, with project
funding provided via purchase of carbon offsets.

GOVERNANCE
Traders Response: The Company does not have any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks or opportunities. The
Board as a whole is responsible for the oversight of Risk Management which would include those risks that may exist
due to the climate and climate changes. Due to the nature of the Company's exposure, that risk is primarily related to
convective storms and specifically the peril of hail. The Company's executive management meets with Board members
semi-annually which includes discussions related to weather related risks, mitigation procedures and action steps to
address those risks both operationally and financially.
STRATEGY
Traders Response: The Company writes private passenger automobile in the Midwest. Based on the Company's
current business plan and strategy, the primary climate-related risk for the Company in the short, medium and long
term is storm severity and specifically the peril of hail.
Presently the Company has not engaged key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and resiliency. Given
management’s assessment of climate risk on its business the primary focus has been on mitigating such risk using
excess of loss protection through the traditional reinsurance markets. ‘That process includes the modeling of the
‘Company's exposure to weather events such as wind, hail, flood and earthquake.
The primary way the Company has reduced greenhouse gas emissions has been through the reduction of travel by its
employees. The Company moved to a work from home structure whereby the vast majority of its workforce works
from home and office meetings are held via video conferencing. This structure has reduced the need for travel to and
from work.
The company is conservatively invested, and the invested assets are 100% invested in fixed income securities primarily
US treasuries, agencies, and certificates of deposit. The investment strategy does not specifically contemplate
investment in the transition to a low carbon economy.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Traders Response: As mentioned in the previous responses the Company considers the effects of climate change on
the severity of convective storms to be its primary climate related risk. The Company models loss scenarios using
industry standard modeling tools and purchases excess of loss coverage to mitigate this risk.
As stated under Strategy, the company is conservatively invested, and the invested assets are 100% invested in fixed
income securities primarily US treasuries, agencies, and certificates of deposit. The Company does not analyze risks
derived from climate scenarios for its investment portfolio,

METRICS AND TARGETS

Traders Response: The Company models loss scenarios utilizing the AIR (Verisk) and RMS industry models. Historically
the AIR model has been more consistent and predictive of the Company's exposure. Modeling results include return
periods up to 1,000 years. In 2024 the Company purchased excess of loss coverage up to the 1,000 year return period
under the AIR model and between 100-250 years under the RMS model.

We do not currently assess and monitor specific to carbon intensity or Scope 1/2/3 GHG emissions, nor developed
internal metrics. However, relative to Scope 1 the Company moved to a work from home structure whereby the vast
majority of its workforce works from home and office meetings are held via video conferencing. This structure has
materially reduced the need for travel to and from work.

TruStage’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 1

Z :

= TruStage
At TruStage, our historic purpose is one of helping people achieve financial security. We're on a
mission to make a brighter financial future accessible to everyone. We are dedicated to helping
more people - in more ways - make confident financial decisions at every stage. Our
longstanding purpose guides us, and we're committed to delivering on our beliefs together.
creating opportunities beside our partners, members of our communities and our employees.
Naturally this leads to certain risk exposures for the Company. Increasingly this includes the
identification and management of risks associated with climate change, which can be either
physical in nature, such as extreme weather patterns, or related to transitions such as policy shifts
and the development of new technology. We're striving to build a culture that is intentional
about reducing our impact on the environment. Our efforts are made to empower the
communities we serve and create positive impact on society daily and to safeguard the
promises we make to policyholders and business partners.
This report discusses TruStage's evolving approach to managing risks related to climate change
consistent with the recommendations of the NAIC using the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosure (TCFD) framework and is structured around four thematic areas:
governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. This report complements
additional Corporate Social Responsibility disclosures available on our corporate website.

1, Governance
TruStage has integrated the consideration of climate change risk into its governance framework
and enterprise risk management processes. Governance for climate change risk has been
established through assigning oversight responsibility to senior management and the Holding
Company Board of Directors.
A) Senior Management
The Chief Risk & Assurance Officer (CRAO) has responsibility for ensuring a comprehensive and
consistent Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework for the organization. This role has
responsibility for understanding the changing landscape of risk and working with cross functional
teams to identify potential ways to address climate risks. In addition to leading the ERM.
framework, the CRAO also leads the Internal Audit function and Enterprise Internal Control
Program. Climate risks are considered as part of ERM, Internal Audit and Enterprise Internal
Control Program ongoing processes.
TruStage’'s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 2

Z :

= TruStage

The CRAO works closely with the Executive Management team, meeting quarterly to discuss

potential risks, including transition and physical risks resulting from changing climate conditions.

The CRAO meets regularly with the Board of Directors and various committees to report on

relevant climate-related risks and strategy concerns.

The TCFD Working Group has responsibilities for climate change reporting and disclosures, and

reports to the CRAO. The Company also established an Environmental, Social, and Governance

{ESG) Core Team that helps to develop related priorities, goals, and metrics for the organization.

AP&C Product Management Committee has been tasked with developing and maintaining a

climate change strategy for property risks - providing recommendations and ongoing

monitoring over time. This committee provides information to the Senior Vice President of P&C

Solutions. In addition, the Vice President of Risk Transfer has responsibility for managing the

organization's ceded reinsurance placements and corporate insurance programs.

B) Board Oversight

The Board's responsibilities are shared through the following committees:

* Governance Committee - has oversight of the Company's ESG Framework and climate-
related risks

* Audit Committee - has oversight of Product-related risks (e.g., climate impacts on P&C
coverages) and Operational risk (e.g., physical operations impact}

* Human Resources and Compensation Committee - has oversight of human resource related
risks (e.g., employee safety and well-being)

* Investment and Capital Committee - has oversight of the investment portfolio construction
including climate-related impacts

In addition to the committee responsibilities, the Board of Directors of the Company has

oversight responsibility for the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. In support of this

responsibility, the Board has received education on climate-related impacts and risks. The Board

committees receive quarterly risk assessment updates including risks related to climate change

and other related emerging risks.

2. Strategy

As a multi-line insurance company, TruStage is committed to understanding the short-, mid- and

long-term implications of changing climate conditions on its business, its customers and in the

communities that we operate in.

TruStage’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 3

\g TruStage

We incorporate climate risk into our underwriting, pricing, reinsurance, investment and
operational decisions. We continually monitor, assess and respond to the risks and opportunities
posed by changing climate conditions to provide products and services that both help our
customers mitigate associated risks and are priced to meet our long-term financial objectives.
Material risks and opportunities receive a greater focus by management. Risks and
opportunities are considered material if they could be expected to reach a critical or major
residual impact level based on the ERM risk scale. This scale includes both quantitative and
qualitative measures of impact over defined time horizons. Risks with a critical or major residual
impact include risks with a credible worst-case scenario that would lead to a catastrophic or
major disruption and result in one or more of the following characteristics: requiring a change in
business strategy; diverting management attention; exceeding defined solvency and financial
performance thresholds; or disrupting our brand, execution, or intergenerational sustainability.
A) Climate-related Risks and Impacts on TruStage’s Business, Strategy, and
Financial Planning

TruStage considers climate risks across a range of time horizons. The shorl-term timeframe of 1-5
years aligns with the Company's financial planning forecast horizon. The medium-term
timeframe of 5-10 years aligns with our emerging risk analysis period as well as certain regulatory
timeframes. The long-term timeframe of 10-30 years aligns with anticipated longer term climate
risks and intergenerational goals.

To date, the Company has focused on climate-related risks in the shor!- and medium-term
horizons, with limited focus on the long-term impacts

The following are specific climate-related risks that TruStage has identified in each timeframe.
The following should not be construed as a characterization regarding the probability,
materiality, or potential financial impact of these risks.

1. Increased regulatory and disclosure requirements as well as possible mandates on
existing products and services (short-term transition)
TruStage has observed emerging guidance and reporting requirements from state and
national regulators that may require additional measuring, monitoring, and reporting on the
impacts of climate change. These new requirements may impact product specifications,
profitability, or markets, and elements of our strategy may become outdated. Increases in
property catastrophe risk associated with climate change will manifest gradually over a
period of many years, while P&C insurance policies are usually of one year duration. This
dynamic allows P&C insurers to adjust rates, coverages, and underwriting guidelines in
response to trends that demonstrate an increase in the frequency and/or severity of natural
TruStage’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 6

catastrophe events. An emerging concern is that regulatory regimes do not allow sufficient
flexibility to ensure that pricing is set at actuarially sound levels, and, in effect, impose rate
review and approval processes that are slow to react to changes in risk levels or reinsurance
costs. In addition, there is the risk that requirements may not be consistent across
jurisdictions. Increased complexity of regulation could require increased staffing and
expertise including but not limited to reporting and systerns changes.

2. Reliance on historical models have the potential to impact how the Company
responds to climate-related risks (short-term transition)
Natural catastrophe modeling is critical to evaluate and quantify climate-related physical
risk for our P&C book of business. A major challenge in this regard is that catastrophe models
based on historical data are unlikely to capture potential future climate change related
shifts of extreme weather events leading to model-miss. Reliance on industry models to assess
level of risk can create disconnects between pricing and perceived risk when there are
significant changes to the models. Unanticipated climate-related events could impair our
financial performance.

3. The risk that weather-related events could result in increased litigation (short-term
liability)
Climate change could increase the number of weather-related claims and subject us to
litigation-related to coverage disputes, class action lawsuits, or litigation stemming from.
consumer groups. For our book of business, this type of litigation could result in extra-
contractual obligations (ECO).

4. The risk of negative stakeholder reaction to our climate strategy (short-term
transition)
As the Company strategy evolves and responds to changing climate conditions and
transition challenges, it could become misaligned with the needs and expectations of
employees, customers, regulators and or rating agencies. Thoughtful planning and effective
communication with stakeholders will help mitigate negative impacts on company culture.
product sales and brand.

5. The risk of negative impacts on the credit or prospects of assets TruStage invests in or
may otherwise invest in (short-term transition/physical)
Global climate change could impact assets that the Company invests in, resulting in realized
and unrealized losses in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on the
Company's results or financial position. In addition, government policies or regulations to
slow climate change, such as emission controls or technology mandates, may have an.
adverse impact on several sectors including but not limited to utilities, transportation,

TruStage’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 7

commercial real estate, and manufacturing, and our investments in these sectors
Depending on the severity of the impacts, the Company may incur additional operating
expense due to the need for additional personnel and/or third-party services to monitor and
assess these risks in the investment portfolio.

Medium-Term Risks — 6-10 Years

6. The risk that a change in customer behavior leads to a change in demand for
products (medium-term transition)

Using a combination of experience and climate projections, the Company has expanded
our P&C Programs business in select areas and has adjusted coverage offered in areas
prone to catastrophes. It is anticipated that climate change will first impact population
health and morbidity, and then ultimately translate to higher mortality. Life insurance
policyholders may have more awareness of their health deterioration and opportunity to
‘anti-select against the Company either at purchase or through in force persistency.

7. The risk that the frequency or severity of natural catastrophes and/or systemic clash
events negatively impact the property insurance book of business and financial
performance (medium-term physical)

Global climate change from rising planet temperatures over the last several decades has
been linked to a number of factors that contribute to the increased unpredictability,
frequency, duration and severity of weather events, including changing weather patterns, a
rise in ocean temperatures, and sea level rise. Further increases or persistence in these
conditions would lead to higher overall property and casualty losses and higher reinsurance
costs. The Company has been intentional in its diversification and underwriting strategy as it
relates to climate risks.

Changes in the reinsurance market due to climate change are anticipated, including
restrictions in available reinsurance capacity or scope of coverage. The Company is
prepared to adjust its risk transfer program accordingly, including seeking alternative risk
financing mechanisms or retaining more risk on a net basis.

8. The potential that extreme weather increases the possibility of an event negatively
impacting staff, building assets, service capabilities or vendors (medium-term
physical)

Severe weather events have the potential to threaten the business operations or result in
unexpected energy costs. TruStage maintains business continuity and disaster recovery
programs. Nonetheless, a natural disaster could affect a single office location or a regional
‘area impacting remote employees. Such an event could disrupt company operations and
ose a threat fo employee safely. There is low risk of service disruption due to system

TruStage’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 8

outages, as there is geographic diversification of data/systems as well as our employee
base.

As part of our business continuity program, TruStage recently implemented a mass
notification and threat intelligence tool that tracks weather-related threats throughout the
country and enables us to notify employees about any disruptive events near our facilities, or
near their homes if working remote, and even when travelling for work. For any employees
facing climate-related issues, the Company provides a disaster time-off benefit.

If third-parties are unavailable following a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business
could be severely compromised. However, the Company's approach to third-parly
management includes identification of third-party business continuity plans, partially
mitigating the risk.

Long-Term Risks — 10-30 Years

9. The risk that Life and Annuity products are impacted by climate-related changes in
mortality or morbidity resulting in negative impacts on our financial performance
(long-term physical)

Climate change could impact frequency of future pandemics or environmental exposures
that affect long-term mortality and morbidity trends which are not contemplated in the
pricing of Life and Annuity products. This would result in unanticipated claims or reserve
requirements impacting financial performance.

10. The risk that our customers and business partners, including credit unions are
increasingly and disproportionately impacted by climate change in ways that could
impact our business model (long-term physical)

TruStage was founded as the trusted partner to credit unions and their members. Eighty-five
years later the Company remains a critical part of the credit union movement while
expanding the distribution of some solutions to meet the needs of other middle market
customers. Recent research! indicates that more than half of all credit unions are located in
areas deemed vulnerable to exireme weather events. TuStage recognizes the growing
climate change interest and related needs among this core customer group as an important
part of long-term strategy.

TruStage relies on a global network of service vendors to manufacture and distribute its
products. While climate change could cause disruption within this network, we are sensitive
to the potential for impacts that could arise if these services need to be relocated

1. Potential to further improve campus and building design to reduce both expenses
and environmental impact while improving employee experience.
TruStage seeks to reduce the environmental impact of its operations. Technological
innovations that improve energy efficiency are of great value to TruStage.
TuStage makes ongoing building investments and takes regular actions to improve energy
efficiency and install energy savings infrastructure. Actions taken as of 12/31/2023 include:

+ TuStage reduces its energy consumption by using energy efficient equipment and
systems. The Company has reduced the onsite data center square footage by about
75% over the last 10 years. in 2020, server optimization and replacement of
uninterrupted power supply (UPS) Units contributed fo a reduction in electricity usage
from 2019 for the overall onsite data center. As a result, the Company reduced
Greenhouse Gas emissions in annual electricity use for the onsite data center since
then and continues to work on improvements.

+ As90-95% of the Company's employee workforce has shifted to remote working and
virtual meetings, we have significantly reduced our carbon footprint relative to daily
commuting, waste generated from cafeteria services, energy usage in our buildings,
etc

+ We are evaluating how to be more efficient with space utilization, which has led to
the introduction of an open workspace environment that is designed to increase
operational efficiency and decrease our need for office space.

+ Our Company continues to reduce our corporate real estate footprint in light of our
remote employee workforce model. In recent years, we have closed four offices,
and there are efforts underway to continue reducing leased office space. With these
closures, we donated office furniture to local nonprofit organizations and repurposed
where possible. One building on our campus was demolished in 2023, and we
recycled the majority of the debris.

+ We continue to monitor the environmental impact of travel, and our corporate travel
has decreased by 20-30% from pre-Pandemic levels reducing our carbon emissions
impact relative to commercial airfare, train, rental car, etc.

2. Make progress toward a paperless environment
TruStage is continuing its efforts to shift to a paperless culture. In 2023, the Company reduced
its enterprise multifunctional device (MFD) footprint by 87% (or down from 117 to 15 MFDs). In
the future, printers will be eliminated throughout the building, and employees will use a print
center in cases where printed materials are unavoidable.
TruStage continues to reduce the environmental impact of its direct mailing campaigns by
using paper stock that is lighter weight, challenging and removing unnecessary disclosure
statements and inserts, using smaller envelope sizes, and using greener toner/ink. All of these
efforts minimize our impact on the environment. The Company is also continuing to invest in
digital marketing campaigns, which will ultimately reduce use of direct mail over time.

3. Development of centralized procurement process fo include assessment of climate-
related risks
In recent years, the Company's Enterprise Procurement Office has added alignment to our
ESG Strategy as a third-party evaluation criteria. In addition to data privacy, supplier
diversity, etc., we evaluate third-parties relative to their strategies, track record, certifications,
awards, etc. relative green solutions / services. Additionally, Enterprise Procurement
continues to ensure third-parties that are assessed as high risk or high strategic importance
have robust disaster recovery plans that are tested regularly. Enterprise Procurement is
looking into advancing our overall Enterprise reporting capabilities relative to third-party
climate-related risks and climate-friendly ratings.

4, Progress over time to take advantage of cleaner energy sources
TruStage has historically looked for opportunities to leverage cleaner energy sources and
seeks alternatives for cleaner energy sources when possible. We partner with power and
other uility providers to review our operations and leverage their incentive programs, when
available.

5. Opportunities to offer new insurance products, services or features allowing us to
differentiate offerings based on R&D
Environmental and regulatory changes have the potential to create opportunities for new
products or product features designed to address climate change. In addition, regulatory
requirements imposed on credit unions have the potential to uncover needs that product
and service areas could fulfill

TruStage’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 12

6. Improved risk consulting with credit unions on environmental issues
Climate change and climate-related risks are a significant challenge faced by financial
institutions. Credit unions should consider how climate change impacts their business and
how business practices and actions may contribute to it. By leveraging the existing climate
change tisk review, we can create additional dialogue related to credit union
processes/policies related to climate tisk. Topics could include: influencing credit union
business continuity and planning, considering the potential impact on loan properties, and
encouraging upgrades to greener office/equipment, and moving towards a paperless
environment. These changes could drive a stronger awareness and increased risk mitigation
related to climate change.
7. ESG investing may represent an opportunity assuming options offer competitive
retums and are consistent with diversification strategy
The Company's investment process has considered climate change and its impacts for
many years. The company has made deliberate efforts to limit exposure to coal and oil
sands, consider environmental factors in real estate, and invest in green energy projects and
companies.
Over the last couple of years, the Company has been exploring more ways to incorporate
ESG factors into its investment analysis throughout the portfolio. As ESG ratings are made
available for more companies and asset classes, there wil be an opportunity to further
integrate ESG factor analysis into investment processes and strategy.
C) Resilience of the Organization's Strategy
The Company assessed the resilience of its strategies against two scenarios defined as “Current
Policies"" and ""Warming Below 2°C"" by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)?
The assessment was based on interviews with business leaders across the organization where
they were asked to consider the qualitative impact and likelihood of each scenario on products,
strategy, operations, and investments. The assessment included the physical, transition and
liability risk presented in each scenario in the short-term (5 years) and long-term (30 years)
Consideration was given to the Company's ability to change strategies as potential risks
develop.
Current Policies: This scenario assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved,
leading to high physical risks. Emissions grow until 2080 leading to about 3°C of warming and
severe physical risks, while transition risk wil be low since few policies will be introduced.
Warming Below 2°C: This scenario assumes that new climate policies are introduced
immediately and gradually become more stringent, resulting in a 67% chance of limiting global
warming to below 2°C. Carbon dioxide removal deployment is relatively low. Net-zero CO?

emissions are achieved after 2070. Physical risk is expected to be lower, while transition risk is
somewhat higher due to an orderly implementation of new policies.

Scenario assessment summary: TruStage current products and strategy will exhibit resilience to
climate change over the next § years under either scenario. In the long-term, increased physical
risk under the Current Policies scenario would require the Company to increase focus on rate
adequacy and retention levels. Under the Warming <2°C Scenario, transition risk would
necessitate additional resources to respond to legislative and reporting requirements
Current Policies
In the short-term, TruStage product strategy will effectively address slow emergence of climate
change impacts on P&C lines and Reinsurance. Similarly, Life & Annuity product strategies will
remain unchanged as increases in morbidity and mortality will take time to materialize. TruStage
strategy continues to remain attuned to the impacts of climate change on its customers to best
meet their needs,
In the long-term, regulatory constraints could cause rate development models to lag
experience, reinsurance markets may shrink their capacity and/or scope of coverage and
affordabiliy of insurance could become an industry-wide issue. The company has implemented
processes fo ensure that Property and Casually rates, policies, forms and underwriting can adjust
relatively quickly fo adapt to changing risk environments. These processes will need to evolve to
address the increasing transition risk as new products could require higher premiums but still
need fo remain competitive. Population shifts could cause more concentration of morbidity
and mortality. Economic strain on targeted sales demographic could put additional pressure on
new sales growth or force business to a riskier demographic. TuStage's strategy will need to

\ TruStage
focus on shaping its protection products (life, health, P&C, auto, home) to aid customers in
managing physical climate-related risks.
Warming Below 2°C:
In the short-term, stricter legislative and reporting requirements under the Warming <2°C
Scenario will result in increased resource needs and associated expenses. These changing
requirements could also impact product strategy and the ability to meet customer needs.
In the long-term, physical risk could be less severe. However, even under these more favorable
conditions, the Company will need to be prepared to respond quickly and make changes to
rates, policies, forms, and/or underwriting. Reinsurers and catastrophe modeling firms will need
time to stabilize and reflect the longer-term benefits of climate change actions. Under this
scenario there will be earlier indications of pricing adequacy for climate change, enabling
better representation of the risk in the pricing process, lowering the long-term transition risk.

Scenario assessment summary: Under the Current Policies Scenario, the Company is already
experiencing physical impacts and expects that strategies to develop alternative power and
fuel sources will become critical to the Company and its third-parties in the long-term. Under the
Warming <2°C Scenario, the Company will need to develop these alternative sources as welll as
implement changes to infrastructure to meet emerging requirements.

Current Policies:
Physical impacts of climate change are already manifesting, and it is expected that extreme
weather events will increasingly disrupt facilities and operations over the next 5 years. Disruptions
to energy and transportation systems will lead to more frequent and longer-lasting power
outages and fuel shortages. Tornados or wind could damage buildings and pose a threat to
employee safety. Power supply could be disrupted due to damage on Company grounds, or to
service vendors. Rising temperatures and increased storm risk could also cause outages requiring
alternative short-term vendor solutions or bringing services back in-house. Physical risk 10
technology is low under this scenario due to geographic diversification of data/systems as well
as the employee base.
Longer term, impacts are projected to continue to intensify and will lead to more frequent and
longer-lasting service disruptions, with cascading impacts. Given this, the business continuity
program will need to be continuously reinforced to remain robust in the face of a greater
number and severity of climate change related challenges over time. The Company also
anticipates potential increased expenses in the long-term as increasing energy costs could
increase vendor expenses. The Company's facility design would not require major changes
under this scenario.
Warming Below 2°C:
Under this scenario, physical impacts will be more moderate. Longer term impacts would include
the potential for increasing energy costs and carbon regulation which could cause vendor costs
to increase, and contracts could become more complex. The Company would need to
respond to stricter climate change infrastructure requirements to reduce emissions and reduce
energy consumption. As the cost of energy increases, the Company could expand solar energy
sources to mitigate some of the impact.

Scenario assessment summary: The Company's current investment strategies will withstand the
short-term impacts of climate change under either scenario. in the long-term, Current Policy
physical impacts may necessitate an abrupt shift in the Company's investment strategy. While
adjustments in portfolio companies’ operations may result in increased transition risk. Under the
Warming <2°C Scenario, impacts would be more moderate.

Current Policies

In the short-term, impact on invesiments will be low/medium. Select industries that impact the
Company portfolio are starting to experience more natural disasters and crop damage,
however, impacts are developing slowly. In the long-term, an increase in frequency and severity
of events could impact investments across multiple industries resulting in severe impacts on
portfolio results. As conditions worsen, TruStage may need to abruptly shift its investment
strategy. Transition risk is high in the long-term recognizing that portfolio companies may require
abrupt changes in their operations. A lack of climate-related action on the part of portfolio
companies may increase their litigation risk.

Warming Below 2°C:
Short-term impacts will be similar to those described under the Current Policies Scenario above.
In the long-term, with more stringent policies in place, the Company could experience
moderate to severe portfolio impacts. Stricter legislative and reporting requirements could
require additional resources for the extra reporting, modeling, and analysis, causing some
minimal disruption in both the short and long-term. The impacts of increased liability risk would
be minimal in both the short and long-term.

3. Risk Management
A) Processes for Identifying and Assessing Climate-Related Risks
The Company regularly monitors the level of risk it is exposed to, whether because of climate
change related risk or otherwise, to ensure adequate protection against excessive levels of
exposure. Climate change risks may negatively affect the credit or prospects of companies
TruStage invests in, may threaten the continuity of business operations, and may impact the
Company's property insurance book of business. Recognizing that climate-related risks can
develop in multiple areas, the Company has identified related risks within the ERM framework
that are monitored as sources for such risk. The ERM framework includes assessment and
monitoring of risks related to alll of our operations, including international locations. The majority
of TruStage’s operations are in the United States. TruStage also has operations in Canada and
the Caribbean.
TuStage's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 18

Z :

= TruStage

Regulatory
The Company monitors the regulatory landscape for changes related to climate change
legislation including new disclosures and reporting requirements and adopts them accordingly.
The Corporate and Legislative Affairs department as well as the Legal, Risk and Compliance
department monitor legislative guidance and regulatory action at the Federal and State level,
both within the U.S. and Canada. The Caribbean corporate compliance team monitors
changes in the regulatory environment related to climate change. The Company works with
trade associations and peer companies to further understand and monitor the landscape of
climate-related risks.
The Company has increased its focus on providing education, understanding, and disclosure
support throughout the organization and with industry trade associations.
Insurance/Underwriting
The Company's P&C Product teams run the book of property insurance through the catastrophe:
models provided by Risk Management Solutions (RMS) and Verisk to understand potential
concentration of risk and to understand potential losses associated with natural catastrophes,
including those that might be influenced by climate change.

Investments
The Company's analysts and portfolio managers regularly assess any risks or threats to
companies in which TruStage invests or may invest to guide investment decisions. The Chief
Investment Officer and portfolio managers consider and strive to limit the concentration of coal
and oil related investments in the Company's investment portfolio. A geography report is
compiled on a quarterly basis that monitors the Company's exposures in the United States by
Metropolitan Statistical Area. Companies with specified environmental risks are monitored to
inform investment decision making process.

Operations

Enterprise Safety and Resiliency (ESR) monitors weather events at all corporate sites and monitors
significant disruptive events using a threat intelligence application to assist remote employees.
The Company maintains business resiliency plans and protocols that ensure appropriate
escalation and communication of risks. The ESR team conducts a Site Hazards Assessment on an
annual basis in support of ISO 22301, the International Standard for implementing and
maintaining effective business continuity plans, systems and processes.

B) Processes for Managing Climate-Related Risks

Insurance/Underwriting
The Company's life and health insurance underwriters monitor and analyze all statistically
relevant actuarial data to assess risks posed to that business. Accordingly, where climate
change risks manifest themselves in statistically relevant and measurable ways that would affect
books of business, TruStage incorporates those risks into the current risk analysis framework and
decision making.
The Company's property and casualty insurance underwriters use detailed data directly and
through trade associations to model potentially severe weather or geological events and factor
those issues into underwriting and reinsurance levels. As described above, the book of property
insurance is run through the catastrophe models provided by Risk Management Solutions and
Verisk to understand the concentration of risk and to understand potential losses associated with
natural catastrophes, including those that might be influenced by climate change. Once these
events are considered, the Company actively monitors the level of risk it is comfortable with and,
when necessary, takes measures to adjust exposure to the appropriate risk level, including the
use of reinsurance.
TuStage provides credit union customers with risk management services including guidance
and consultation regarding disaster preparedness and other effects of exlreme weather or
geological conditions. That guidance is intended to better prepare customers to handle and
mitigate the effects of an extreme weather or geological event. Many educational materials
are also made available to credit unions in the Protection Resource Centers, including webinars
and self-assessments. Examples of risk management materials include disaster planning
templates as well as flood tisk and fire prevention materials.

investments
The Company considers the geographical location and concentration of the asset portfolio, as
well as the tenor of the security when evaluating the risk profile of individual investments and the
portfolio. To the extent that climate change risks increase the amount of investment risk
exposure, the Company has policies in place to mitigate those risks. For instance, if isk
concentration in a geographical location were to exceed the exposure limits of the Company's
risk tolerance because of updated loss models (whether caused by climate change or
otherwise}, the Company would assess options for reducing, transferring, or mitigating that risk to
bring the exposure back within tolerance. The company aims to limit investment exposure in
geographic areas increasingly impacted by severe events such as hurricanes and wildfires.
Operations
The Company maintains business resiliency plans that account for events such as natural
catastrophes that impact business operations. The Company executes these plans as offices or
TruStage’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023, Page 20

employees are impacted by weather-related events. ESR tracks disruptive events that require
such a response. Vendor resiliency remains a risk. The Business Resiliency team onboarded an
industry standard management tool that will help identify critical vendors. Until that system is fully
functional, Enterprise Procurement and business areas will continue managing business
continuity risks by reviewing third-party business continuity plans, ensuring third-party business
continuity plans are regularly updated and tested, leverage Enterprise Procurement's third-party
incident management process when situations arise, holding third-parties to service level
agreements (SLAs) and contractual commitments, etc.

C) Processes for Integrating Climate-Related Risks into the Organization's Overall Risk
Management
TruStage engages in annual strategy and planning processes that are designed to include staff
from across the Company in discussion and education around longer-term risks and
opportunities - inclusive of climate change. On an ongoing basis the Company also monitors
competitive and market Intelligence as well as regulatory and compliance related activity.
Climate risk is managed through the existing Enterprise Risk Management Framework, Internal
Audit function, and Enterprise Internal Control Program.

ERM Framework

Enterprise level climate-related risks are managed along with other risks as part of the Enterprise
Risk Register. The register includes climate-specific risks that are regularly monitored and assessed
including risks related to business resiliency, investments, IT, various product areas, strategy,
facilities and third-party management.

Climate risks are identified through interviews with risk owners and senior leaders. Risk owners
assess these risks on a quarterly basis using a scale of impact and likelihood based on a credible
worst-case scenario. The Chief Risk & Assurance Officer is responsible for monitoring enterprise
risks, including climate change risk, and reports findings to management and the Board.
The Company maintains a separate register of emerging risks which have the potential to
impact the Company sometime in the future and develops a series of education sessions
around external trends.

Internal Audit function
The Company regularly conducts internal audits in areas that could have climate-related risks
associated with the function or process under review. In addition, the internal audit function
would respond to specific climate-related requests or elevated areas of risk as needed.
TruStage’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 21

a
a :
= TruStage
Enterprise Internal Control Program
The Company maintains an inventory of controls and mitigations as part of the EICP. The
effectiveness of the risk response is monitored and reported to senior management. As climate-
related controls are developed, they will be monitored under this program.
4. Metrics and Targets
A) Metrics used to Assess Climate-related Risks and Opportunities
insurance/Underwriting
The Company monitors catastrophe exposure metrics by region to assess geographic
concentration risk. The Company has historically purchased a Properly Catastrophe treaty with
@ 1:250 year return period using the blended results from the RMS and Verisk catastrophe
modeling which overlays the Company exposure profile on historical weather events.
Operations
TruStage tracks energy and electricity use and makes continuous improvements to building
infrastructure to achieve maximum efficiency possible. The Company utilizes the EPA tool Energy
Star Portfolio Manager to track and assess energy and electricity use and subsequent
Greenhouse Gas emissions produced by each facility including its onsite data center facility. The
Company benchmarks its energy and electricity use through Energy Star, as well as through
county and state level organizations. The Company received the following awards and
certifications in 2022:
+ Energy Star Certifications - three office buildings qualified
‘+ Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council Green Master Program - attained Green
Professional status
+ Dane County Climate Champion awards: 1) Building Energy Use - improved from Emerging
to 2stars, 2) Water Savings Practices ~ 2 stars, 3) Employee Commuting - 1 star, 4) Building
Design award - awarded to TruStage and its construction partners
investments
The Company includes climate-related risk analysis into the investment underwriting process. The
inclusion of climate related risks is part of an overall risk assessment necessary to accurately
assess risk and retum of a given invesiment in a fundamental credit analysis framework.
B) Scope 1, Scope 2 Green House Gas Emissions and the Related Risks
To reduce our operational emissions, we leverage efficiencies and a data-driven approach to
TuStage's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Report 2023 Page 22

our real estate portfolios. We utilize an environmental management system that enables us to
regularly review our operations, measure our impacts, and identify opportunities that increase
efficiency and potentially reduce costs. TruStage’s periodically reviews each of our owned
faciliies, evaluates emerging technologies such as alternative energy, and their potential use in
our facilities, and we partner with power and other utlity providers to review our operations.

There were some changes in the real estate portfolio in 2023 that impacted emissions. A building
was demolished as part of a campus renovation project at TruStage’s headquarters, and a new
building that was completed in late 2022 was added to the portfolio. Another building has been
added to TruStage's portfolio in 2023 in conjunction with a business acquisition. The net effect of
this activity increased Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We will continue to make efforts to reduce
emissions at each location
C) Targets Used to Manage Climate-related Risks and Opportunities and
Performance against Targets
The Company continues to work towards connecting various ESG workstreams. Climate related
mettics and targets will be a consideration.

[Area [ SurveyResponse

UPMC is an Integrated Delivery and Finance System (IDFS) and as such, Is comprised of multiple hospital and

healthcare provider organizations, as well as a fully diversified health payer business domiciled in the state of

Pennsylvania. UPMC's Insurance Services Division (ISD) includes UPMC Health Plan and other associated

insurance business lines made up of non-profit and for-profit organizations with over 7,000 employees located

mainly in Western Pennsylvania and focused on serving the health insurance needs of our members and
communities. A listing of the insurance entities under the NAIC group is as follows:

© UPMC Health Plan, Ine.

© UPMC Health Network, Inc.

© UPMC Health Benefits, Inc.

= UPMC For You, Inc.

© UPMC Work Alliance, Inc.

*  UPMC Health Options, Inc.

+ UPMC Health Coverage, Inc.

*  Workpartners National, Inc.

+ Community Care Behavioral Health Organization

The ISD strongly shares environmental and climate change concerns with our broader community and

stakeholders, and we engage in a variety of substantive and meaningful activities to minimize our emissions,

carbon footprint and environmental impact, and to safeguard the health, safety and wellness of our many
stakeholders.

‘+ Environmental stewardship and activities at the broader UPMC IDFS level are overseen by the UPMC Center
for Sustainability Steering Committee (CSSC), which is a cross-functional group comprised of
representatives from across the IDFS, including the ISD. The CSSC’s role is to initiate and coordinate climate
and environmental initiatives and activities that include projects such as managing energy usage, reducing
GHG emissions, materials recycling, environmental sponsorship of external organizations, and oversight
over the UPMC Center for Sustainability, among others. As one could anticipate, the primary focus and
majority of the CSSC’s activities relate to UPMC’s Health Services Division (HSD) operations, which include
40+ hospitals and many other physical locations and ancillary operational services, for which potential
climate/environmental risks and their impact on HSD operations is more direct. Under the governance
oversight of the CSSC, UPMC intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its footprint by 50-65%%
for existing buildings and to achieve zero carbon status for new construction and renovations in existing
buildings by the year 2030. To further demonstrate UPMC’s commitment to the climate, we have signed
the Health Care Sector Climate Pledge led by the White House and the United States Department of Health
& Human Services (HHS) along with local pledges to the City of Pittsburgh, City of Erie, and the New
Kensington 2030 District.

1

+ _ The ISD leases approximately 942,000 square feet of office space, mostly concentrated in Western
Pennsylvania. While our utilities are generally included in our lease agreements, we have taken the
additional environmental initiative to significantly reduce energy use in our leased properties by investing
in, and achieving, LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certifications in over 60% of our
total leased office space. Our primary headquarters facility, which represents office space for the majority
of ISD employees who continue to regularly work in the office, has undergone multi-year renovations that,
contribute to energy efficiency and carbon emissions reductions related to lighting, electricity, and water
flow efficiency.

‘© We recognize there is a clear correlation and symbiosis between reducing administrative expenses,
supporting our employees with flexible work approaches, and the reduction of carbon emissions. For the
ISD, roughly 80% of our total employee base utilizes a work-from-home model on a regular basis, with the
majority (59% of employees) working full-time from home and another 21%% under a flexible hybrid
arrangement, thereby reducing direct company energy utilization/consumption, carbon emissions and road
congestion. For our employees who commute to the office, we additionally provide benefits for the use of
public transportation where our administrative offices are located, and the utilization of these benefits
similarly contributes toward the reduction in consumption, emissions and road congestion.

+ The impact from climate change and climate change-related developments is considered an important
factor within our overall focus to effectively identify, evaluate, and manage the broader social and
environmental determinants of health, particularly when evaluating broader population health, value-
based healthcare, and whole-person (ie., holistic) health. Considerations that can influence the health of
our members include climate change, potentially more extreme weather patterns and/or ancillary effects
from climate change-impacted weather patterns of other regions, and air/water quality, as well as lead-
based paint, food security, physical safety, access to education, and other such significant topical areas that
may individually and collectively impact our members’ and communities’ health and wellness in a manner
that directly or indirectly relates to broader environmental health. Studies have shown that the more
vulnerable social and economic groups may be more adversely impacted by climate change and extreme
weather events, which could affect overall morbidity and mortality trends, and the ISD participates in
various activities to better understand and address these wide-ranging and associated issues. This includes
our community health and outreach teams engaging in proactive community outreach and direct,
personalized intervention activities with our membership, specifically our at-risk and more vulnerable
community members. These outreach programs and intervention activities fall under our efforts to address
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and health equity issues which are impacted or exacerbated by
climate and environmental issues.

+ The ISD is a leader in promoting and utilizing telehealth and digital/mobile health applications, which not
only increase accessibility for our members but also reduce the need for travel, thus minimizing vehicle
emissions and road congestion. We anticipate continued implementation and enhancements of telehealth
and digital/mobile capabilities moving forward across our product lines as member demand for and
Utilization of such services continue to increase.

The ISD, as a responsible corporate citizen, has been a prominent, leading voice and participant in
environmental and sustainability efforts and initiatives for many years and decades. The ISD supports many
climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related causes within our communities through active
support, sponsorships and funding. Sponsorship and engagement activities include numerous regional and
county parks, nature reserves, and environmental foundations, groups and events, among others. This also
includes investments and partnerships in environmental health across UPMC and in collaboration with the
University of Pittsburgh, such that initiatives relating to carbon output reduction and energy efficiency
innovation and technology are supported and leveraged in the broader health sciences realm to facilitate
cross-disciplinary translational science and developments in the broader healthcare context. Over the last
decade, the ISD has contributed several millions of dollars to climate change-, sustainability- and
environment-related organizations and causes across the state and our broader communities. These
organizations and causes include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

‘© Our UPMC Health Plan Board of Directors Finance, Audit & Compliance (FAC) Committee has oversight of
our overarching enterprise risk profile to include financial, audit, compliance, risk management, and legal
operations/issues/risks, among other established accountabilities. In the event that climate change risk
might be considered a potentially relevant factor impacting our broader enterprise risk profile, the FAC
Committee would have commensurate oversight of climate-related risks.
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has determined that an increase in extreme weather
events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, may present material
implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses. The SASB has
additionally noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact
costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead
to an increased cost of capital. A higher incidence of disease could adversely affect both clinical and non-clinical
staff availability, resulting in higher administrative expenditures related to sick leave and turnover. Continuing
climate change may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water
consumption required to maintain our leased buildings.
‘The New England Journal of Medicine previously identified three primary categories of climate change-related
risks to healthcare:
(4) Primary Risks: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-
enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
(2) Secondary Risks: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems,
particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host

(3) Tertiary Risks: More diffuse effects (e.g. mental health problems in falling or more vulnerable communities,
displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups), as well as consequences of tension
and conflict related to climate change-related declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space,
ete.)
The clinical and financial implications of these health-related impacts are complicated, nuanced and somewhat
difficult to precisely quantify. The ISD is in the process of further evaluating the potential risks that climate
change may pose to our organization and to the health and wellness of our members. While we have not
identified and measured specific risks given our particular industry, this is an important topic that lends itself to
thoughtful, continued consideration and further analysis.
Ait relates to natural disasters and the potential exacerbation that human activities may manifest, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania historically ranks as one of the lowest-risk states for natural disaster
occurrences among various industry analyses. With ISD offices and employees located mainly in the greater,
Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania region, there have not been any significant widespread regional natural

disasters or events in the past 150 years outside of the “Great Floods” of Pittsburgh in 1907 and 1936. Today,
the US Army Corps of Engineers manages the region’s flood control efforts, comprised of strategic reservoirs
controlling the drainage basins in the upper Ohio Valley. From a geographical standpoint, our region would
tend to present relatively lower risk from a climate change-exacerbated natural disaster perspective.
The link between climate change and the currently identified drivers of our overall business strategy, operations
and financial performance is, based on these and other considerations, sufficiently attenuated and could benefit
from additional research and information. As such, we have not yet conducted specific scenario assessments
regarding climate change. But we continue to monitor this situation.
The UPMC ISD has a formalized and established ERM Program that regularly identifies, assesses, manages and
monitors numerous enterprise risks for the organization and our business operations. While climate change
does not pose a free-standing primary enterprise risk at this time, given our industry and business operations,
climate change could potentially present as a relevant driver or variable within one or more of our existing
enterprise risk registers. As such, we have an established process for identifying issues and drivers that may be
relevant to climate change vis-a-vis its relationship to, and potential impact upon, our existing enterprise risk
universe. If such a connection becomes apparent, this would manifest in potential impact upon our business,
operations, strategy, and our members and employees, as well as relevant financial implications.
‘When incorporating a broader view of the UPMC IDFS, there are a number of functional areas that study,
promote and advance climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related considerations into their
activities (e.g. UPMC Environmental Initiatives, UPMC Real Estate & Construction, UPMC Facilities, UPMC Supply
Chain, etc.). We facilitate the coordination of such assessments and deliberations with the UPMC Center for
Sustainability operated by and across our parent organization, as appropriate.
UPMC ISD does not directly own or operate any property or assets that fall under the EPA’s Scope 1 direct,
emissions category. Scope 2 indirect emissions usage from utilities are covered under our facility leases, and we
have no direct input or control regarding the source or type of energy generation. As a health payer, the ISD
has a nominal level of Scope 3 indirect emissions impact (both upstream and downstream) through normal
business operations in supporting our members, providers, and community stakeholders. As such, we do not
track or utilize associated metrics in a formal risk management capacity.
As noted in the responses above, and ast relates to Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, UPMC has pledged to reduce
GHG emissions and is targeting to be carbon net-neutral by 2050. UPMC is a signatory of the White House and
HHS's Health Care Sector Climate Pledge, and the UPMC CSSC is engaged in the active monitoring and
assessment of GHG emissions for the entire UPMC organization. Specific and relevant metrics and targets will
be developed, tracked and monitored by the CSSC, as appropriate.
As also noted in other responses here, the UPMC ISD ERM Program and our various executive-level risk owners
actively monitor strategy, operational, financial, and enterprise risk-related developments that may impact the
ISD and its business, products, services, and numerous stakeholders. Should any such developments/risks,
including ones that may include climate change-related elements, rise to a level that prospectively approach our
risk appetite/tolerance, the ISD ERM function would appropriately support and facilitate UPMC ISD

UPMIC is an Integrated Delivery and Finance System (IDFS) and as such, is comprised of multiple hospital and

healthcare provider organizations, as well as a fully diversified health payer business domiciled in the state of

Pennsylvania. UPMC’s Insurance Services Division (ISD) includes UPMC Health Plan and other associated

insurance business lines made up of non-profit and for-profit organizations with over 7,000 employees located

mainly in Western Pennsylvania and focused on serving the health insurance needs of our members and
communities. A listing of the insurance entities under the NAIC group is as follows:

© UPMC Health Plan, Inc.

* UPMC Health Network, Inc.

© UPMC Health Benefits, Inc.

+ UPMC For You, Inc.

© UPMC Work Alliance, Inc.

© UPMC Health Options, Inc.

+ UPMC Health Coverage, Inc.

* Workpartners National, Inc.

* Community Care Behavioral Health Organization

The ISD strongly shares environmental and climate change concerns with our broader community and

stakeholders, and we engage in a variety of substantive and meaningful activities to minimize our emissions,

carbon footprint and environmental impact, and to safeguard the health, safety and wellness of our many
stakeholders.

+ Environmental stewardship and activites at the broader UPMC IDFS level are overseen by the UPMC Center
for Sustainability Steering Committee (CSSC), which is a cross-functional group comprised of
representatives from across the IDFS, including the ISD. The CSSC's role is to initiate and coordinate climate
and environmental initiatives and activities that include projects such as managing energy usage, reducing
GHG emissions, materials recycling, environmental sponsorship of external organizations, and oversight
over the UPMC Center for Sustainability, among others. As one could anticipate, the primary focus and
majority of the CSSC's activities relate to UPMC’s Health Services Division (HSD) operations, which include
40+ hospitals and many other physical locations and ancillary operational services, for which potential
climate/environmental risks and their impact on HSD operations is more direct. Under the governance
oversight of the CSSC, UPMC intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its footprint by 50-6594%
for existing buildings and to achieve zero carbon status for new construction and renovations in existing
buildings by the year 2030. To further demonstrate UPMC’s commitment to the climate, we have signed
the Health Care Sector Climate Pledge led by the White House and the United States Department of Health
& Human Services (HHS) along with local pledges to the City of Pittsburgh, City of Erie, and the New
Kensington 2030 District.

+ _ The ISD leases approximately 942,000 square feet of office space, mostly concentrated in Western
Pennsylvania, While our utilities are generally included in our lease agreements, we have taken the
additional environmental initiative to significantly reduce energy use in our leased properties by investing
in, and achieving, LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certifications in over 60% of our
total leased office space. Our primary headquarters facility, which represents office space for the majority
of ISD employees who continue to regularly work in the office, has undergone multi-year renovations that,
contribute to energy efficiency and carbon emissions reductions related to lighting, electricity, and water
flow efficiency.

‘© We recognize there is a clear correlation and symbiosis between reducing administrative expenses,
supporting our employees with flexible work approaches, and the reduction of carbon emissions. For the
ISD, roughly 80% of our total employee base utilizes a work-from-home model on a regular basis, with the
majority (59% of employees) working full-time from home and another 21%% under a flexible hybrid
arrangement, thereby reducing direct company energy utilization/consumption, carbon emissions and road
congestion. For our employees who commute to the office, we additionally provide benefits for the use of
public transportation where our administrative offices are located, and the utilization of these benefits
similarly contributes toward the reduction in consumption, emissions and road congestion.

‘+ The impact from climate change and climate change-related developments is considered an important
factor within our overall focus to effectively identify, evaluate, and manage the broader social and
environmental determinants of health, particularly when evaluating broader population health, value-
based healthcare, and whole-person (ie., holistic) health. Considerations that can influence the health of
our members include climate change, potentially more extreme weather patterns and/or ancillary effects
from climate change-impacted weather patterns of other regions, and air/water quality, as well as lead-
based paint, food security, physical safety, access to education, and other such significant topical areas that
may individually and collectively impact our members’ and communities’ health and wellness in a manner
that directly or indirectly relates to broader environmental health. Studies have shown that the more
vulnerable social and economic groups may be more adversely impacted by climate change and extreme
weather events, which could affect overall morbidity and mortality trends, and the ISD participates in
various activities to better understand and address these wide-ranging and associated issues. This includes
our community health and outreach teams engaging in proactive community outreach and direct,
personalized intervention activities with our membership, specifically our at-risk and more vulnerable
community members. These outreach programs and intervention activities fall under our efforts to address
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and health equity issues which are impacted or exacerbated by
climate and environmental issues.

* The ISD isa leader in promoting and utilizing telehealth and digital/mobile health applications, which not
only increase accessibility for our members but also reduce the need for travel, thus minimizing vehicle
emissions and road congestion. We anticipate continued implementation and enhancements of telehealth
and digital/mobile capabilities moving forward across our product lines as member demand for and
utilization of such services continue to increase.

The ISD, asa responsible corporate citizen, has been a prominent, leading voice and participant in
environmental and sustainability efforts and initiatives for many years and decades. The ISD supports many
climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related causes within our communities through active
support, sponsorships and funding. Sponsorship and engagement activities include numerous regional and
county parks, nature reserves, and environmental foundations, groups and events, among others. This also
includes investments and partnerships in environmental health across UPMC and in collaboration with the
University of Pittsburgh, such that initiatives relating to carbon output reduction and energy efficiency
innovation and technology are supported and leveraged in the broader health sciences realm to facilitate
cross-disciplinary translational science and developments in the broader healthcare context. Over the last
decade, the ISD has contributed several millions of dollars to climate change-, sustainability- and
environment-related organizations and causes across the state and our broader communities. These
organizations and causes include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

‘© Our UPMC Health Plan Board of Directors Finance, Audit & Compliance (FAC) Committee has oversight of
our overarching enterprise risk profile to include financial, audit, compliance, risk management, and legal
operations/issues/risks, among other established accountabilities. In the event that climate change risk
might be considered a potentially relevant factor impacting our broader enterprise risk profile, the FAC
Committee would have commensurate oversight of climate-related risks.
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has determined that an increase in extreme weather
events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, may present material
implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses. The SASB has
additionally noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact
costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead
to an increased cost of capital. A higher incidence of disease could adversely affect both clinical and non-clinical
staff availabilty, resulting in higher administrative expenditures related to sick leave and turnover. Continuing
climate change may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water
consumption required to maintain our leased buildings.
‘The New England Journal of Medicine previously identified three primary categories of climate change-related
risks to healthcare:
(4) Primary Risks: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-
enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
(2) Secondary Risks: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems,
particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host
ecology; and
(3) Tertiary Risks: More diffuse effects (e.g. mental health problems in failing or more vulnerable communities,
displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups), as well as consequences of tension
and conflict related to climate change-related declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space,
ete.)

Pennsylvania. While our utilities are generally included in our lease agreements, we have taken the
additional environmental initiative to significantly reduce energy use in our leased properties by investing
in, and achieving, LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certifications in over 60% of our
total leased office space. Our primary headquarters facility, which represents office space for the majority
of ISD employees who continue to regularly work in the office, has undergone multi-year renovations that,
contribute to energy efficiency and carbon emissions reductions related to lighting, electricity, and water
flow efficiency.

‘© We recognize there is a clear correlation and symbiosis between reducing administrative expenses,
supporting our employees with flexible work approaches, and the reduction of carbon emissions. For the
ISD, roughly 80% of our total employee base utilizes a work-from-home model on a regular basis, with the
majority (59% of employees) working full-time from home and another 21%% under a flexible hybrid
arrangement, thereby reducing direct company energy utilization/consumption, carbon emissions and road
congestion. For our employees who commute to the office, we additionally provide benefits for the use of
public transportation where our administrative offices are located, and the utilization of these benefits
similarly contributes toward the reduction in consumption, emissions and road congestion.

+ The impact from climate change and climate change-related developments is considered an important
factor within our overall focus to effectively identify, evaluate, and manage the broader social and
environmental determinants of health, particularly when evaluating broader population health, value-
based healthcare, and whole-person (ie., holistic) health. Considerations that can influence the health of
our members include climate change, potentially more extreme weather patterns and/or ancillary effects
from climate change-impacted weather patterns of other regions, and air/water quality, as well as lead-
based paint, food security, physical safety, access to education, and other such significant topical areas that
may individually and collectively impact our members’ and communities’ health and wellness in a manner
that directly or indirectly relates to broader environmental health. Studies have shown that the more
vulnerable social and economic groups may be more adversely impacted by climate change and extreme
weather events, which could affect overall morbidity and mortality trends, and the ISD participates in
various activities to better understand and address these wide-ranging and associated issues. This includes
our community health and outreach teams engaging in proactive community outreach and direct,
personalized intervention activities with our membership, specifically our at-risk and more vulnerable
community members. These outreach programs and intervention activities fall under our efforts to address
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and health equity issues which are impacted or exacerbated by
climate and environmental issues.

+ The ISD is a leader in promoting and utilizing telehealth and digital/mobile health applications, which not
only increase accessibility for our members but also reduce the need for travel, thus minimizing vehicle
emissions and road congestion. We anticipate continued implementation and enhancements of telehealth
and digital/mobile capabilities moving forward across our product lines as member demand for and
Utilization of such services continue to increase.

The ISD, as a responsible corporate citizen, has been a prominent, leading voice and participant in
environmental and sustainability efforts and initiatives for many years and decades. The ISD supports many
climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related causes within our communities through active
support, sponsorships and funding. Sponsorship and engagement activities include numerous regional and
county parks, nature reserves, and environmental foundations, groups and events, among others. This also
includes investments and partnerships in environmental health across UPMC and in collaboration with the
University of Pittsburgh, such that initiatives relating to carbon output reduction and energy efficiency
innovation and technology are supported and leveraged in the broader health sciences realm to facilitate
cross-disciplinary translational science and developments in the broader healthcare context. Over the last

‘© Our UPMC Health Plan Board of Directors Finance, Audit & Compliance (FAC) Committee has oversight of
our overarching enterprise risk profile to include financial, audit, compliance, risk management, and legal
operations/issues/risks, among other established accountabilities. In the event that climate change risk
might be considered a potentially relevant factor impacting our broader enterprise risk profile, the FAC
Committee would have commensurate oversight of climate-related risks.
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has determined that an increase in extreme weather
events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, may present material
implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses. The SASB has
additionally noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact
costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead
to an increased cost of capital. A higher incidence of disease could adversely affect both clinical and non-clinical
staff availability, resulting in higher administrative expenditures related to sick leave and turnover. Continuing
climate change may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water
consumption required to maintain our leased buildings.
‘The New England Journal of Medicine previously identified three primary categories of climate change-related
risks to healthcare:
(4) Primary Risks: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-
enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
(2) Secondary Risks: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems,
particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host
ecology; and
(3) Tertiary Risks: More diffuse effects (e.g. mental health problems in falling or more vulnerable communities,
displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups), as well as consequences of tension
and conflict related to climate change-related declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space,
ete.)
The clinical and financial implications of these health-related impacts are complicated, nuanced and somewhat
difficult to precisely quantify. The ISD is in the process of further evaluating the potential risks that climate
change may pose to our organization and to the health and wellness of our members. While we have not
identified and measured specific risks given our particular industry, this is an important topic that lends itself to
thoughtful, continued consideration and further analysis.
Ait relates to natural disasters and the potential exacerbation that human activities may manifest, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania historically ranks as one of the lowest-risk states for natural disaster
occurrences among various industry analyses. With ISD offices and employees located mainly in the greater,
Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania region, there have not been any significant widespread regional natural
3

disasters or events in the past 150 years outside of the “Great Floods” of Pittsburgh in 1907 and 1936. Today,
the US Army Corps of Engineers manages the region’s flood control efforts, comprised of strategic reservoirs
controlling the drainage basins in the upper Ohio Valley. From a geographical standpoint, our region would
tend to present relatively lower risk from a climate change-exacerbated natural disaster perspective.
The link between climate change and the currently identified drivers of our overall business strategy, operations
and financial performance is, based on these and other considerations, sufficiently attenuated and could benefit
from additional research and information. As such, we have not yet conducted specific scenario assessments
regarding climate change. But we continue to monitor this situation.
The UPMC ISD has a formalized and established ERM Program that regularly identifies, assesses, manages and
monitors numerous enterprise risks for the organization and our business operations. While climate change
does not pose a free-standing primary enterprise risk at this time, given our industry and business operations,
climate change could potentially present as a relevant driver or variable within one or more of our existing
enterprise risk registers. As such, we have an established process for identifying issues and drivers that may be
relevant to climate change vis-a-vis its relationship to, and potential impact upon, our existing enterprise risk
universe. If such a connection becomes apparent, this would manifest in potential impact upon our business,
operations, strategy, and our members and employees, as well as relevant financial implications.
‘When incorporating a broader view of the UPMC IDFS, there are a number of functional areas that study,
promote and advance climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related considerations into their
activities (e.g. UPMC Environmental Initiatives, UPMC Real Estate & Construction, UPMC Facilities, UPMC Supply
Chain, etc.). We facilitate the coordination of such assessments and deliberations with the UPMC Center for
Sustainability operated by and across our parent organization, as appropriate.
UPMC ISD does not directly own or operate any property or assets that fall under the EPA’s Scope 1 direct,
emissions category. Scope 2 indirect emissions usage from utilities are covered under our facility leases, and we
have no direct input or control regarding the source or type of energy generation. As a health payer, the ISD
has a nominal level of Scope 3 indirect emissions impact (both upstream and downstream) through normal
business operations in supporting our members, providers, and community stakeholders. As such, we do not
track or utilize associated metrics in a formal risk management capacity.
As noted in the responses above, and ast relates to Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, UPMC has pledged to reduce
GHG emissions and is targeting to be carbon net-neutral by 2050. UPMC is a signatory of the White House and
HHS's Health Care Sector Climate Pledge, and the UPMC CSSC is engaged in the active monitoring and
assessment of GHG emissions for the entire UPMC organization. Specific and relevant metrics and targets will
be developed, tracked and monitored by the CSSC, as appropriate.
As also noted in other responses here, the UPMC ISD ERM Program and our various executive-level risk owners
actively monitor strategy, operational, financial, and enterprise risk-related developments that may impact the
ISD and its business, products, services, and numerous stakeholders. Should any such developments/risks,
including ones that may include climate change-related elements, rise to a level that prospectively approach our
risk appetite/tolerance, the ISD ERM function would appropriately support and facilitate UPMC ISD
management in our respective risk response and remediation plans.

GHG emissions, materials recycling, environmental sponsorship of external organizations, and oversight
over the UPMC Center for Sustainability, among others. As one could anticipate, the primary focus and
majority of the CSSC’s activities relate to UPMC’s Health Services Division (HSD) operations, which include
40+ hospitals and many other physical locations and ancillary operational services, for which potential
climate/environmental risks and their impact on HSD operations is more direct. Under the governance
oversight of the CSSC, UPMC intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its footprint by 50-65%%
for existing buildings and to achieve zero carbon status for new construction and renovations in existing
buildings by the year 2030. To further demonstrate UPMC’s commitment to the climate, we have signed
the Health Care Sector Climate Pledge led by the White House and the United States Department of Health
& Human Services (HHS) along with local pledges to the City of Pittsburgh, City of Erie, and the New
Kensington 2030 District.

tend to present relatively lower risk from a climate change-exacerbated natural disaster perspective.
The link between climate change and the currently identified drivers of our overall business strategy, operations
and financial performance is, based on these and other considerations, sufficiently attenuated and could benefit
from additional research and information. As such, we have not yet conducted specific scenario assessments
regarding climate change. But we continue to monitor this situation.
The UPMC ISD has a formalized and established ERM Program that regularly identifies, assesses, manages and
monitors numerous enterprise risks for the organization and our business operations. While climate change
does not pose a free-standing primary enterprise risk at this time, given our industry and business operations,
climate change could potentially present as a relevant driver or variable within one or more of our existing
enterprise risk registers. As such, we have an established process for identifying issues and drivers that may be
relevant to climate change vis-a-vis its relationship to, and potential impact upon, our existing enterprise risk
universe. If such a connection becomes apparent, this would manifest in potential impact upon our business,
operations, strategy, and our members and employees, as well as relevant financial implications.
‘When incorporating a broader view of the UPMC IDFS, there are a number of functional areas that study,
promote and advance climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related considerations into their
activities (e.g. UPMC Environmental Initiatives, UPMC Real Estate & Construction, UPMC Facilities, UPMC Supply
Chain, etc.). We facilitate the coordination of such assessments and deliberations with the UPMC Center for
Sustainability operated by and across our parent organization, as appropriate.
UPMC ISD does not directly own or operate any property or assets that fall under the EPA’s Scope 1 direct,
emissions category. Scope 2 indirect emissions usage from utilities are covered under our facility leases, and we
have no direct input or control regarding the source or type of energy generation. As a health payer, the ISD
has a nominal level of Scope 3 indirect emissions impact (both upstream and downstream) through normal
business operations in supporting our members, providers, and community stakeholders. As such, we do not
track or utilize associated metrics in a formal risk management capacity.
As noted in the responses above, and ast relates to Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, UPMC has pledged to reduce
GHG emissions and is targeting to be carbon net-neutral by 2050. UPMC is a signatory of the White House and
HHS's Health Care Sector Climate Pledge, and the UPMC CSSC is engaged in the active monitoring and
assessment of GHG emissions for the entire UPMC organization. Specific and relevant metrics and targets will
be developed, tracked and monitored by the CSSC, as appropriate.
As also noted in other responses here, the UPMC ISD ERM Program and our various executive-level risk owners
actively monitor strategy, operational, financial, and enterprise risk-related developments that may impact the
ISD and its business, products, services, and numerous stakeholders. Should any such developments/risks,
including ones that may include climate change-related elements, rise to a level that prospectively approach our
risk appetite/tolerance, the ISD ERM function would appropriately support and facilitate UPMC ISD

UPMC is an Integrated Delivery and Finance System (IDFS) and as such, Is comprised of multiple hospital and

healthcare provider organizations, as well as a fully diversified health payer business domiciled in the state of

Pennsylvania. UPMC's Insurance Services Division (ISD) includes UPMC Health Plan and other associated

insurance business lines made up of non-profit and for-profit organizations with over 7,000 employees located

mainly in Western Pennsylvania and focused on serving the health insurance needs of our members and
communities. A listing of the insurance entities under the NAIC group is as follows:

© UPMC Health Plan, Ine.

© UPMC Health Network, Inc.

© UPMC Health Benefits, Inc.

= UPMC For You, Inc.

© UPMC Work Alliance, Inc.

*  UPMC Health Options, Inc.

+ UPMC Health Coverage, Inc.

*  Workpartners National, Inc.

+ Community Care Behavioral Health Organization

The ISD strongly shares environmental and climate change concerns with our broader community and

stakeholders, and we engage in a variety of substantive and meaningful activities to minimize our emissions,

carbon footprint and environmental impact, and to safeguard the health, safety and wellness of our many
stakeholders.

‘+ Environmental stewardship and activities at the broader UPMC IDFS level are overseen by the UPMC Center
for Sustainability Steering Committee (CSSC), which is a cross-functional group comprised of
representatives from across the IDFS, including the ISD. The CSSC’s role is to initiate and coordinate climate
and environmental initiatives and activities that include projects such as managing energy usage, reducing
GHG emissions, materials recycling, environmental sponsorship of external organizations, and oversight
over the UPMC Center for Sustainability, among others. As one could anticipate, the primary focus and
majority of the CSSC’s activities relate to UPMC’s Health Services Division (HSD) operations, which include
40+ hospitals and many other physical locations and ancillary operational services, for which potential
climate/environmental risks and their impact on HSD operations is more direct. Under the governance
oversight of the CSSC, UPMC intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its footprint by 50-65%%
for existing buildings and to achieve zero carbon status for new construction and renovations in existing
buildings by the year 2030. To further demonstrate UPMC’s commitment to the climate, we have signed
the Health Care Sector Climate Pledge led by the White House and the United States Department of Health
& Human Services (HHS) along with local pledges to the City of Pittsburgh, City of Erie, and the New
Kensington 2030 District.

+ _ The ISD leases approximately 942,000 square feet of office space, mostly concentrated in Western
Pennsylvania. While our utilities are generally included in our lease agreements, we have taken the
additional environmental initiative to significantly reduce energy use in our leased properties by investing
in, and achieving, LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certifications in over 60% of our
total leased office space. Our primary headquarters facility, which represents office space for the majority
of ISD employees who continue to regularly work in the office, has undergone multi-year renovations that,
contribute to energy efficiency and carbon emissions reductions related to lighting, electricity, and water
flow efficiency.

‘© We recognize there is a clear correlation and symbiosis between reducing administrative expenses,
supporting our employees with flexible work approaches, and the reduction of carbon emissions. For the
ISD, roughly 80% of our total employee base utilizes a work-from-home model on a regular basis, with the
majority (59% of employees) working full-time from home and another 21%% under a flexible hybrid
arrangement, thereby reducing direct company energy utilization/consumption, carbon emissions and road
congestion. For our employees who commute to the office, we additionally provide benefits for the use of
public transportation where our administrative offices are located, and the utilization of these benefits
similarly contributes toward the reduction in consumption, emissions and road congestion.

+ The impact from climate change and climate change-related developments is considered an important
factor within our overall focus to effectively identify, evaluate, and manage the broader social and
environmental determinants of health, particularly when evaluating broader population health, value-
based healthcare, and whole-person (ie., holistic) health. Considerations that can influence the health of
our members include climate change, potentially more extreme weather patterns and/or ancillary effects
from climate change-impacted weather patterns of other regions, and air/water quality, as well as lead-
based paint, food security, physical safety, access to education, and other such significant topical areas that
may individually and collectively impact our members’ and communities’ health and wellness in a manner
that directly or indirectly relates to broader environmental health. Studies have shown that the more
vulnerable social and economic groups may be more adversely impacted by climate change and extreme
weather events, which could affect overall morbidity and mortality trends, and the ISD participates in
various activities to better understand and address these wide-ranging and associated issues. This includes
our community health and outreach teams engaging in proactive community outreach and direct,
personalized intervention activities with our membership, specifically our at-risk and more vulnerable
community members. These outreach programs and intervention activities fall under our efforts to address
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and health equity issues which are impacted or exacerbated by
climate and environmental issues.

+ The ISD is a leader in promoting and utilizing telehealth and digital/mobile health applications, which not
only increase accessibility for our members but also reduce the need for travel, thus minimizing vehicle
emissions and road congestion. We anticipate continued implementation and enhancements of telehealth
and digital/mobile capabilities moving forward across our product lines as member demand for and
Utilization of such services continue to increase.

The ISD, as a responsible corporate citizen, has been a prominent, leading voice and participant in
environmental and sustainability efforts and initiatives for many years and decades. The ISD supports many
climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related causes within our communities through active
support, sponsorships and funding. Sponsorship and engagement activities include numerous regional and
county parks, nature reserves, and environmental foundations, groups and events, among others. This also
includes investments and partnerships in environmental health across UPMC and in collaboration with the
University of Pittsburgh, such that initiatives relating to carbon output reduction and energy efficiency
innovation and technology are supported and leveraged in the broader health sciences realm to facilitate
cross-disciplinary translational science and developments in the broader healthcare context. Over the last
decade, the ISD has contributed several millions of dollars to climate change-, sustainability- and
environment-related organizations and causes across the state and our broader communities. These
organizations and causes include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

‘© Our UPMC Health Plan Board of Directors Finance, Audit & Compliance (FAC) Committee has oversight of
our overarching enterprise risk profile to include financial, audit, compliance, risk management, and legal
operations/issues/risks, among other established accountabilities. In the event that climate change risk
might be considered a potentially relevant factor impacting our broader enterprise risk profile, the FAC
Committee would have commensurate oversight of climate-related risks.
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has determined that an increase in extreme weather
events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, may present material
implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses. The SASB has
additionally noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact
costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead
to an increased cost of capital. A higher incidence of disease could adversely affect both clinical and non-clinical
staff availability, resulting in higher administrative expenditures related to sick leave and turnover. Continuing
climate change may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water
consumption required to maintain our leased buildings.
‘The New England Journal of Medicine previously identified three primary categories of climate change-related
risks to healthcare:
(4) Primary Risks: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-
enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
(2) Secondary Risks: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems,
particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host
ecology; and
(3) Tertiary Risks: More diffuse effects (e.g. mental health problems in falling or more vulnerable communities,
displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups), as well as consequences of tension
and conflict related to climate change-related declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space,
ete.)
The clinical and financial implications of these health-related impacts are complicated, nuanced and somewhat
difficult to precisely quantify. The ISD is in the process of further evaluating the potential risks that climate
change may pose to our organization and to the health and wellness of our members. While we have not
identified and measured specific risks given our particular industry, this is an important topic that lends itself to
thoughtful, continued consideration and further analysis.
Ait relates to natural disasters and the potential exacerbation that human activities may manifest, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania historically ranks as one of the lowest-risk states for natural disaster
occurrences among various industry analyses. With ISD offices and employees located mainly in the greater,
Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania region, there have not been any significant widespread regional natural
3

disasters or events in the past 150 years outside of the “Great Floods” of Pittsburgh in 1907 and 1936. Today,
the US Army Corps of Engineers manages the region’s flood control efforts, comprised of strategic reservoirs
controlling the drainage basins in the upper Ohio Valley. From a geographical standpoint, our region would
tend to present relatively lower risk from a climate change-exacerbated natural disaster perspective.
The link between climate change and the currently identified drivers of our overall business strategy, operations
and financial performance is, based on these and other considerations, sufficiently attenuated and could benefit
from additional research and information. As such, we have not yet conducted specific scenario assessments

+ The impact from climate change and climate change-related developments is considered an important
factor within our overall focus to effectively identify, evaluate, and manage the broader social and
environmental determinants of health, particularly when evaluating broader population health, value-
based healthcare, and whole-person (ie., holistic) health. Considerations that can influence the health of
our members include climate change, potentially more extreme weather patterns and/or ancillary effects
from climate change-impacted weather patterns of other regions, and air/water quality, as well as lead-
based paint, food security, physical safety, access to education, and other such significant topical areas that
may individually and collectively impact our members’ and communities’ health and wellness in a manner
that directly or indirectly relates to broader environmental health. Studies have shown that the more
vulnerable social and economic groups may be more adversely impacted by climate change and extreme
weather events, which could affect overall morbidity and mortality trends, and the ISD participates in
various activities to better understand and address these wide-ranging and associated issues. This includes
our community health and outreach teams engaging in proactive community outreach and direct,
personalized intervention activities with our membership, specifically our at-risk and more vulnerable
community members. These outreach programs and intervention activities fall under our efforts to address
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and health equity issues which are impacted or exacerbated by
climate and environmental issues.

+ The ISD is a leader in promoting and utilizing telehealth and digital/mobile health applications, which not
only increase accessibility for our members but also reduce the need for travel, thus minimizing vehicle
emissions and road congestion. We anticipate continued implementation and enhancements of telehealth
and digital/mobile capabilities moving forward across our product lines as member demand for and
Utilization of such services continue to increase.

The ISD, as a responsible corporate citizen, has been a prominent, leading voice and participant in
environmental and sustainability efforts and initiatives for many years and decades. The ISD supports many
climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related causes within our communities through active
support, sponsorships and funding. Sponsorship and engagement activities include numerous regional and
county parks, nature reserves, and environmental foundations, groups and events, among others. This also
includes investments and partnerships in environmental health across UPMC and in collaboration with the
University of Pittsburgh, such that initiatives relating to carbon output reduction and energy efficiency
innovation and technology are supported and leveraged in the broader health sciences realm to facilitate
cross-disciplinary translational science and developments in the broader healthcare context. Over the last
decade, the ISD has contributed several millions of dollars to climate change-, sustainability- and
environment-related organizations and causes across the state and our broader communities. These
organizations and causes include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

‘© Our UPMC Health Plan Board of Directors Finance, Audit & Compliance (FAC) Committee has oversight of
our overarching enterprise risk profile to include financial, audit, compliance, risk management, and legal
operations/issues/risks, among other established accountabilities. In the event that climate change risk
might be considered a potentially relevant factor impacting our broader enterprise risk profile, the FAC
Committee would have commensurate oversight of climate-related risks.
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has determined that an increase in extreme weather
events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, may present material
implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses. The SASB has
additionally noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact
costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead
to an increased cost of capital. A higher incidence of disease could adversely affect both clinical and non-clinical
staff availability, resulting in higher administrative expenditures related to sick leave and turnover. Continuing
climate change may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water
consumption required to maintain our leased buildings.
‘The New England Journal of Medicine previously identified three primary categories of climate change-related
risks to healthcare:
(4) Primary Risks: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-
enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
(2) Secondary Risks: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems,
particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host
ecology; and
(3) Tertiary Risks: More diffuse effects (e.g. mental health problems in falling or more vulnerable communities,
displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups), as well as consequences of tension
and conflict related to climate change-related declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space,
ete.)
The clinical and financial implications of these health-related impacts are complicated, nuanced and somewhat
difficult to precisely quantify. The ISD is in the process of further evaluating the potential risks that climate
change may pose to our organization and to the health and wellness of our members. While we have not
identified and measured specific risks given our particular industry, this is an important topic that lends itself to
thoughtful, continued consideration and further analysis.
Ait relates to natural disasters and the potential exacerbation that human activities may manifest, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania historically ranks as one of the lowest-risk states for natural disaster
occurrences among various industry analyses. With ISD offices and employees located mainly in the greater,
Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania region, there have not been any significant widespread regional natural
3

disasters or events in the past 150 years outside of the “Great Floods” of Pittsburgh in 1907 and 1936. Today,
the US Army Corps of Engineers manages the region’s flood control efforts, comprised of strategic reservoirs
controlling the drainage basins in the upper Ohio Valley. From a geographical standpoint, our region would
tend to present relatively lower risk from a climate change-exacerbated natural disaster perspective.
The link between climate change and the currently identified drivers of our overall business strategy, operations
and financial performance is, based on these and other considerations, sufficiently attenuated and could benefit
from additional research and information. As such, we have not yet conducted specific scenario assessments
regarding climate change. But we continue to monitor this situation.
The UPMC ISD has a formalized and established ERM Program that regularly identifies, assesses, manages and
monitors numerous enterprise risks for the organization and our business operations. While climate change
does not pose a free-standing primary enterprise risk at this time, given our industry and business operations,
climate change could potentially present as a relevant driver or variable within one or more of our existing
enterprise risk registers. As such, we have an established process for identifying issues and drivers that may be
relevant to climate change vis-a-vis its relationship to, and potential impact upon, our existing enterprise risk
universe. If such a connection becomes apparent, this would manifest in potential impact upon our business,
operations, strategy, and our members and employees, as well as relevant financial implications.
‘When incorporating a broader view of the UPMC IDFS, there are a number of functional areas that study,
promote and advance climate change-, sustainability- and environment-related considerations into their
activities (e.g. UPMC Environmental Initiatives, UPMC Real Estate & Construction, UPMC Facilities, UPMC Supply
Chain, etc.). We facilitate the coordination of such assessments and deliberations with the UPMC Center for
Sustainability operated by and across our parent organization, as appropriate.
UPMC ISD does not directly own or operate any property or assets that fall under the EPA’s Scope 1 direct,
emissions category. Scope 2 indirect emissions usage from utilities are covered under our facility leases, and we
have no direct input or control regarding the source or type of energy generation. As a health payer, the ISD
has a nominal level of Scope 3 indirect emissions impact (both upstream and downstream) through normal
business operations in supporting our members, providers, and community stakeholders. As such, we do not
track or utilize associated metrics in a formal risk management capacity.
As noted in the responses above, and ast relates to Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, UPMC has pledged to reduce
GHG emissions and is targeting to be carbon net-neutral by 2050. UPMC is a signatory of the White House and
HHS's Health Care Sector Climate Pledge, and the UPMC CSSC is engaged in the active monitoring and
assessment of GHG emissions for the entire UPMC organization. Specific and relevant metrics and targets will
be developed, tracked and monitored by the CSSC, as appropriate.
As also noted in other responses here, the UPMC ISD ERM Program and our various executive-level risk owners
actively monitor strategy, operational, financial, and enterprise risk-related developments that may impact the
ISD and its business, products, services, and numerous stakeholders. Should any such developments/risks,
including ones that may include climate change-related elements, rise to a level that prospectively approach our
risk appetite/tolerance, the ISD ERM function would appropriately support and facilitate UPMC ISD
management in our respective risk response and remediation plans.

STRATEGY
2 Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the
insurer’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the
insurer's businesses, strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider including the
following:
+ Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of
climate risk and resiliency. *
+ Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in
its operations or organizations.
A. Describe the climate-+elated risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
medium, and long term.
In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
medium, and longer term, insurers should consider including the following:
+ Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short term, 5-10 years
as medium term, and 10-30 years as long term.
Response:
Ascension developed a Climate Resiliency Plan in support of our sustainability goals
and in alignment with the U.S. Health and Human Services Health Sector Climate
Pledge. The report was published in June 2024 and is publicly available on the
Ascension website.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business,
strategy, and financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business,
strategy, and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
Page 4 of 10

+ Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the
transition to a low carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related
risk.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a
low carbon economy.
Response:
Ascension operates in markets with environmental risks that will periodically increase
costs to remediate disaster effects and temporarily disrupt volumes. Specifically,
Florida and Gulf Coast locations have been affected by hurricanes.
Mitigating factors include Ascension’ size and broad diversification of geographies as.
well as strong cash levels to absorb costs.
Environmental considerations include carbon transition; physical climate risks; water
management; waste and pollution; natural capital.

As both waste and energy management contribute most to the problem and are
tangible areas where we can have the biggest influence, this will in turn
positively impact the communities we serve.

Ascension is committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and carbon
footprint. As a signatory of the Race to Zero campaign through membership in
the Health Care Climate Council, Ascension will provide annual reports on our
goals to reduce emissions and on progress to meet those goals using the Health
Care Climate Challenge platform.

© Ascension submitted a 2019 Baseline for Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas
emissions. We will submit 2020, 2021 and 2022 emissions to Race to Zero in
December 2023.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different
climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
Page 5 of 10

Response:
Healthcare's impact on the environment is inextricably linked to the health of the
communities and patients in our care. It is estimated that greenhouse gas emissions
from healthcare represent an incredible 10% of all U.S. emissions. Climate impacts have
already riddled many of the communities Ascension serves. Extreme heat days are
more common in Austin, Texas. Places like Nashville, Tennessee, have experienced
more frequent and intense rain events due to increased atmospheric temperatures. As
oceans absorb heat, hurricane seasons are starting earlier and becoming more severe,
as seen from Mobile, Alabama, to Jacksonville, Florida.
Ascension is reducing energy consumption and transitioning to clean energy
sources to reduce air pollution in the community.
Ascension is reducing landfill usage in our communities and emissions from
existing landfills.
RISK MANAGEMENT
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers
should consider including the following:
+ Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its
underwriting portfolio, and how the company is managing its underwriting exposure
with respect to physical, transition and liability risk. *
+ Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage
their potential physical and transition climate related risks, if applicable. *
+ Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its
investment portfolio, including what investment classes have been considered. *
A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers
should consider including the following:
Page 6 of 10

+ Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications
and how frequently the process is completed. *
Response:
As to the underwriting portfolio, we do consider that climate change has an impact on
health claims as there may be more claims related to increased chronic disease like
asthma and impacts to policyholder for injuries due to increased catastrophic events
like floods. Our actuarial models assume increased claims frequency as
climate-related risks increase.
As an insurer we have always taken a conservative approach to portfolio investments
exclusively investing in US Savings Bonds.
B. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks.
Response:
We communicate frequently with policyholders to get health assessments and establish
with primary care providers to manage chronic diseases, as those are often the most
impacted by climate.
Ascension works with its Property Insurance carrier, and Environmental Liability
Insurance carrier to identify and respond to climate-related risks. This includes
developing plans to reduce or control the exposures, and evaluation of what is insured
or uninsured by Ascension’s insurance programs. Ascension's insurance carriers have
improved their ability to identify, provide exposure reports, and provide suggestions on
how to address the risks.
FM's 10/22 Climate Risk Report provided a Score of 44, identified the top 10 Climate
physician risk recommendations, and human eliminate recommendations. Ascension is
developing responses to these recommendations.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.
Page 7 of 10

In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the
following:
+ Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's
general enterprise-risk management process or a separate process and how
frequently the process is completed.
+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting
risks, including which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios
are used, and what timeframes are considered
+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its
investments, including which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are
used, and what timeframes are considered.
Response:
Climate -related exposures are addressed through Ascension'’s ERM process and are
specifically addressed through the work with Ascension's Property and Environmental
insurance carriers. Both carriers provide reports from location specific reviews, and
analytical analysis which is completed by their centralized support specialists.
Ascension meets with its Property Insurance representatives monthly to review reports,
discuss identified risks, develop response plans, and provide updates on ongoing work
across Ascension.
We communicate frequently with policyholders to get health assessments and establish
with primary care providers to manage chronic diseases, as those are often the most
impacted by climate.
As to the underwriting portfolio, we do consider that climate change has an impact on
health claims as there may be more claims related to increased chronic disease like
asthma and impacts to policyholder for injuries due to increased catastrophic events
like floods. Our actuarial models assume increased claims frequency as
climate-related risks increase.
As an insurer we have always taken a conservative approach to portfolio investments
exclusively investing in US Savings Bonds.

Enterprise Risk Management Framework

USAA’s risk management philosophy centers on proactive, risk-aware decision-making. USAA is
committed to a risk management framework that includes identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling,
managing, and reporting risks. USAA’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework (the “ERMF”) considers
the external factors, of which climate is an example, as part of USAA’s risk management activities. The
ERMF defines the structure and approach to managing risk at USAA to support risk-taking activities that
are aligned with risk appetite and strategic objectives. These risk management practices are
operationalized through the ERMF and its related governance documents, organizational structures, and
risk management processes and programs such as:

‘* Enterprise Risk Inventory and Assessment Programs: Climate Risk has been identified as a Top-of-
mind emerging risk for USAA. Catastrophe risk is identified in the risk inventory as a top risk, as
catastrophe risk presents the largest risk to our Homeowners, Rental Property, and Renters
insurance product portfolio. Direct impacts on the property portfolio occur in case of
mismanagement of catastrophe risk and the frequency or concentration of catastrophe events,
which may be impacted by climate change. USAA’s climate risk management addresses both
Physical and Transition climate risk.

‘* Stress Testing: Stress testing scenarios at USAA include both macroeconomic and idiosyncratic
risks, which are informed by the recurring updates of the risk inventory and socialization with
management committees and board of directors, to gauge the impact to capital and liquidity
adequacy and to inform the board of directors on alignment of risk profile with risk appetite.
Generally, the scenarios include one or more P&C catastrophe events (extreme weather events).

Board Governance

The USAA Board of Directors (the “USAA Board”) is the parent board that oversees USAA’s risk
management philosophy and risk and compliance culture, sets direction regarding USAA's corporate
strategy and risk appetite, and promotes accountability across the Enterprise.

USAA board committees that have specific climate oversight responsibilities include:

*_ USAA Nominating and Governance Committee: Oversees USAA’s strategy related to sustainability
matters, including USAA’s strategy around climate. This committee receives regular updates each
year from the Chief Diversity and Sustainability Officer.

© USAA Risk and Compliance Committee: Oversees the implementation of, adherence to, and
operation of USAA’s ERMF. It reviews emerging and top risks, including climate risks, as part of its
ERMF oversight responsibilities. This includes oversight of USAA’s risk appetite, risk metrics, and
processes to identify, measure, and manage risks. This committee receives updates on climate
risks from the Enterprise's Chief Risk Officer and Chief Compliance Officer.

‘The Enterprise corporate governance system is centered around the USAA Board with separate subsidiary
governance for USAA P&C and USAA Life companies. USAA Life Insurance Company of New York is
governed by its own board of directors with climate-related oversight responsibilities, where discussions
are held in accordance with the New York Department of Financial Services Guidance on Climate-Related
Disclosures.

4

USAA’s Risk Council, USAA P&C management committees, and USAA Life management committees have
specific oversight responsibilities such as providing management of Enterprise-wide risk and providing a
forum for strategic and operational business decisions.

Key Management Functions

USAA has several key leadership roles that assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities:

+ USAA P&C Chief Actuary ~ leads the P&C business performance analytics strategy, governance,
control, policy development and actuarial community of practice for USAA. This includes the P&C
Pricing actuarial functions, direct oversight of the P&C loss reserving actuary and the P&C catastrophe
risk management and reinsurance teams. The P&C Chief Actuary helps connect the P&C line of
business with the larger Enterprise and shares accountability for capital, investments, pricing strategy,
information management, business performance and for overseeing and monitoring climate-related
risk related to actuarial functions by analyzing data to better predict how climate can affect USAA P&C
operations and members.

*_USAA Life Chief Actuary - leads all actuarial functions for USAA Life, including life, health and annuity
products as well as having the responsibility for reinsurance, modeling, and data and analytics. In
addition, the USAA Life Chief Actuary chairs the Life Asset Liability and Risk Management Committee
and is a member of the Life Senior Management Committee and has staff representation at the Life
Compliance and Operational Risk Committee where climate-related risk is addressed in the
appropriate context of USAA Life.

‘© USAA Chief Investments Officer ~ oversees the investment strategy and portfolios for USAA, USAA
P&C, USAA Life, managing funds whose underlying assets are managed by third-party/unaffiliated
investment companies or several internal investment teams. The USAA Chief Investments Officer is
responsible for asset allocation and manager selection decision-making and is accountable for
appropriately assessing and managing all risks associated with USAA’s investment strategy, including
financial risk.

‘+ USAA Chief Risk Officer ~ responsible for overseeing Enterprise material risks, including that climate-
related risks, are properly identified, measured, monitored, controlled, managed, and reported.

* USA Chief Diversity and Sustainability Officer - established in 2022 and coordinates cross-
functionally across USAA’s lines of business and staff agencies to implement USAA’s sustainability
operating model and member-centric sustainability strategy.

USAA has incorporated oversight, assessment, and management of climate-related risks into its business

strategy and established an appropriate climate-related governance structure. An Enterprise Climate &

Environment Working Group was established in 2022 to coordinate and discuss climate-related risks and

opportunities. This group comprises members from several key roles throughout the company, who are

responsible for assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. The Group meets monthly
for awareness and coordination of climate-related risks and opportunities and plays a critical role in
identifying risk, managing efforts to address the risks, establishing strategies, and understanding the
impacts of climate-related risks to our businesses. It is co-chaired by the USAA P&C Chief Actuary and our

Main risks and opportunities to USAA
‘At USAA, we specifically recognize that climate risk is a Top-of-mind emerging risk that is integrated into
our existing ERMF. By incorporating climate risk in our ERMF, we can give appropriate consideration
alongside other significant risks faced by USAA.

6

USAA has identified four primary areas of climate risk: (1) Physical risks, (2) Business Continuity risks, (3)
Transitional risks related to Regulation, and (4) Physical and Transitional risks to Investment Portfolios.
The climate-related risks and opportunities are most prevalent in USAA’s property and casualty business
and investment portfolio. Risks to the life insurance business are most notable in USA Life’s investment
portfolio, as further noted below.

1. Physical risk - USAA provides financial products and services to facilitate the financial security of
its members, associates, and their families, including personal and commercial lines insurance
products, primarily in the United States. Weather-related catastrophes affect a significant portion
of USAA’s personal lines insurance portfolio. USAA leverages sophisticated catastrophe models to
set internal thresholds for capital that are conservative and enable the association to operate
from a position of financial strength. These capital thresholds drive underwriting, pricing, and
reinsurance-purchase decisions and seek to appropriately cover potential impacts of changing
weather patterns. USA is committed to preserving its financial strength and, as such, is taking
the uncertainties surrounding natural catastrophes into consideration when setting internal
capital thresholds. The company is prepared to withstand a once in a multi-century catastrophe
event and maintains a conservative premium-to-surplus ratio to support its financial strength.
USAA’s internal capital thresholds are considered when setting geographic and financial growth
strategies. USAA also maintains a comprehensive liquidity risk management program, including
detailed contingency funding plans and access to comprehensive and diverse funding sources, to
ensure ongoing financial strength to meet USAA’s obligations to members through a range of
multiple catastrophic events over multiple years.

2. Business continuity risk ~ An increase in the frequency and/or severity of catastrophic tropical
cyclones or flooding in high-risk regions of coastlines along the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast or
wildfires in western states, and tornados, could all potentially impact USAA’s operations. While
USAA’s regional offices are located in high-risk areas of the United States (Arizona, Colorado,
Florida, Texas, and Virginia), contingency plans are in place to allow for continued service to
members if a regional office is impacted. Mobile equipment, extensive training, a flexible remote
work program and a geographically dispersed workforce enables USA to respond swiftly after a
major catastrophe. A geographically dispersed workforce also minimizes significant impact to
operations from a major catastrophe in a location where the workforce may be concentrated.

© USAAis recognized by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as a
Weather Ready Nation Ambassador as a result of its collaboration with NOAA to share
preparedness messaging to the public, serve as an example by implementing resilience
best practices, and advance outreach to vulnerable populations.

© Since 2011, all USAA locations are StormReady® certified by the National Weather
Service. StormReady organizations are better prepared to respond to emergency weather
situations through advanced planning, education, and awareness.

3. Transitional risk related to Regulation — Over the last decade, insurance regulators have taken a
more active role in evaluating the pricing and underwriting of climate risk. USAA has built a team
with considerable experience in catastrophe risk management and appropriate industry

7

certifications. This team provides catastrophe risk insights and innovative approaches to tailor
catastrophe model results and better reflect USAA’s risk. In addition, USAA also works with
federal, state, local authorities, non-profit organizations, and insurance-related organizations ~
such as the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) and the Federal Alliance for
Safe Homes (FLASH) ~ to promote wise geographical growth and building code standards for new
construction.

4, Physical and Transitional risk to investment portfolios - USA maintains a diversified investment
portfolio in multiple asset classes across a range of industry sectors that mitigates the portfolio’s
exposure to climate related risk. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) related factors are
considered in the security credit analysis by our investment managers. The USAA Chief Investment
Office has determined that Climate Related Financial Risk is currently low across our aggregate
investment portfolios. USAA recognizes that in the medium to long-term timeframe, potential
changes in public policy and consumer expectations, and the technological impacts of climate
change could impact USAA’s investment portfolio performance and maintains significant portfolio
liquidity that will allow for repositioning as needed. Ongoing monitoring and assessment will
continue.

In addition to these primary risks, USAA considers the potential for related secondary risk exposures, such
as reputation and strategic risks. For example, these may arise from claims handling processes reaching
maximum capacity, necessary rate increases to cover catastrophe risk exposure, or service interruptions
in a scenario where business continuity is impacted by weather events.

Environmental stewardship

USAA’s approach to environmental stewardship is grounded in the belief that taking care of our members
and employees means taking care of the communities where we live, work and play. That is why we value
sustainability, conservation and helping those communities become more resilient.

As part of this stewardship, USAA is committed to wisely using and conserving our natural resources by
prioritizing efficient operations. In addition, our strategic sustainability blueprint addresses several other
key areas including employee workplace health and wellbeing, employee engagement and external
partnerships, energy and water consumption efficiency, resource conservation and encouraging recycling.

‘* In.2008, USA eliminated the use of Styrofoam products in all its cafeterias and since 2010, USAA
has composted food wastes within its kitchens and dining areas.

‘As part of USAA’s recycling program, since 2011, USAA has sponsored employee recycling events
in the Spring and Fall at our major campuses and distributed centers. The purpose of the event is
to provide enterprise sponsored time and convenience for employees to recycle their electronic
devices (e.g., televisions, pcs, monitors, small appliances) and properly dispose of
personal/confidential documents at no charge in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.

Water Conservation

* Since 2019, USAA’s office facilities have reduced freshwater consumption by 31%.

+ Allour restroom facilities have been equipped with automatic water dispensing valves for faucets

Resilience of USAA’s strategy
USAA has implemented regular, ongoing monitoring of catastrophe model performance on USAA’s
current book of business to quantify risk posed by catastrophes under current climate conditions.
Concentration risk routines are also executed regularly, with action plans to reduce risk when thresholds
are exceeded. These risk management routines protect the financial stability of the Association against
unacceptable catastrophe risk as it evolves over time.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights several Shared Socioeconomic
Pathways (SSPs) with resulting Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) Scenarios. USAA licenses
climate conditioned models to provide future-state insights into risk from all of these SSP scenarios. Since
SSP1 and SSP2 reflect minimal change, USAA is confident in execution against these two scenarios. To
assess USAA’s level of long-term resiliency against the remaining scenarios, USAA has partnered with
catastrophe model vendors to assess the risk to USAA’s book of business from SSP3 and SSPS in
atmospheric conditions expected in future decades as far out as 2050 and 2100. Results from these studies
give management reassurance of the robustness in USAA’s current risk routines to respond to this evolving
risk.
Engagement with Key Constituents
USAA takes a member-centric approach to sustainability. Sustainability issues, including climate risk, are
discussed with management, the appropriate committees on USAA’s Board of Directors, and regulators
of USAA’s insurance businesses. USAA members are regularly encouraged to share their perspectives with
the CEO, whose office maintains a robust member relations program.
10

USAA also regularly communicates to members and key constituent groups (including military affinity

organizations such as The American Legion) the many programs available to help protect USAA members’

autos, property, and lives. USAA promotes weather-related loss prevention and safety advice through

member communications such as articles on usaa.com, content marketing, social media, and public

relations efforts via the news media. Additionally, in 2017, USAA became the title sponsor of two

conferences: StormCenter Live and the National Tropical Weather Conference. These conferences seek to

provide updates to the meteorological and emergency management community as well as others on the

latest technological and scientific findings on the causes and behavior of severe weather. This information

is then used to communicate risks to the public and provide education on steps to mitigate exposure to

loss from severe weather events.

In addition, USAA was a founding member of IBHS and continues to support its mission “to conduct

objective scientific research to identify and promote the most effective ways to strengthen homes,

businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss.”

USAA was a founding member of FLASH and continues to support its mission “To promote life safety,

property protection and resiliency by empowering the community with knowledge and resources for

strengthening homes and safeguarding families from natural and man-made disasters.” In 2016, in

partnership with USAA, FLASH joined the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National

Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) and The Weather Channel to create #HurricaneStrong, a

national hurricane resilience initiative that won the Outstanding Achievement in Public Awareness Award

at the National Hurricane Conference. The outreach campaign, seeks to increase public safety and reduce

damages from hurricanes by educating and helping prepare millions of Americans in hurricane-exposed

areas with five key messages:

1. Personal Safety-Know your evacuation zone

2. Family Preparedness-Build a disaster supply kit

3. Financial Security-Have an insurance checkup

4. Damage Prevention-Strengthen your home

5. Community Service-Help your neighbor

In 2022, 2023 and 2024, USAA’s P&C Chief Actuary led a climate change class for leaders in the financial

services industry at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

USAA’s Investments

USAA uses an investment manager to oversee its portfolios. The manager along with the USAA investment

team factor sustainability considerations (e.g., transition risk, leaders / laggards by sector, risk

management view) into investment decision-making alongside the traditional investment process. The

active manager integrates sustainability consideration into processes to help reduce transition risk. USAA

has also invested in the energy transition through private equity / infrastructure funds and through

renewable tax credit equity.

USAA has issued multiple sustainability bonds supporting initiatives that relate to climate risk and

resiliency such as green buildings or the Bank originating auto loans for members financing electric

vehicles.

‘Supporting USAA Members’ Resilience to Natural Disasters

Through its membership in several disaster-mitigation and community resiliency focused organizations,

USAA’s corporate social responsibility efforts tie into helping rebuild military communities’ post-disaster
1

through partnerships with community leaders, military leadership, and non-profit volunteer organizations
such as Team Rubicon and the American Red Cross.
For example, USAA provides its members with access to multiple programs and services to help them
mitigate wildfire-related property loss, including the Wildfire Response Program, USAA’s Property Risk
Assessment Tool, and support for Firewise communities discussed in response to question three. As a
member of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC), USAA has also been
instrumental in supporting the creation of the IBHS Wildfire Prepared Home designation in California. In
addition, USAA actively participated in industry working groups that worked with regulators to establish
the California Wildfire Mitigation Discount, which is now mandatory in California.
USAA is committed to promoting resilient construction throughout the United States and in coastal areas
in particular. Exceptions to USAA's coastal underwriting guidelines for homes built to the IBHS Fortified
Gold and Silver standards are available in all states outside of Florida. In the state of Florida, USAA allows
exceptions to its coastal underwriting guidelines for homes built to the IBHS Fortified Gold standard. USAA
has partnered with windstorm mitigation companies to offer reduced-cost inspections to its members to
encourage inspections and provide education on the actions its members can take to further protect
homes against high wind exposure, while also earning a discount on their premium if eligible for the
Florida Building Code credits. These credits are mandated by the state of Florida to consumers who have
home features that are more likely to withstand the impact of a tropical cyclone event. If members choose
to take action to retrofit their homes to obtain additional FBC credits within one year of their initial
premier assessment, a follow-up inspection is available at no cost to verify that the work was done
properly. Members can then submit this inspection form to USA to receive savings on their homeowner's
insurance policy.
In 2020, USAA undertook an initiative to understand the impact of climate change on non-catastrophe
related weather losses on the property book of business to identify any opportunities to further reduce
exposure from weather events. This initiative reinforced the value of current mitigation offerings and
efforts to expand them in the upcoming years.

USAA maintains strong risk management routines to identify, assess and manage climate-related physical
risks within the insurance portfolio. USAA’s highly skilled personnel run, validate, implement, and monitor
the use of industry-leading licensed catastrophe models to support the assessment of financial risk from
hurricanes, wildfires, floods, tornados, severe thunderstorms, and winter storms. Where appropriate,
model results may be calibrated or results from multiple models may be blended to better represent
USAA’s historical claims data for the current book of business. Model performance against the USAA book
of business is formally reviewed at least annually. In addition, an independent Model Risk Management
team reviews model performance at least annually. Modeled loss data supports many downstream
functions and is updated many times each year for the forecast and planning process and quarterly for
the concentration risk and capital planning analyses. Many risk metrics are utilized in these analyses, to
include Average Annual Loss (AL), TVaR (Tail Value at Risk), and PML (Probable Maximum Loss).
In addition to monitoring climate risks for the near term, USAA has engaged in long-term climate change
studies to assess the future risk in 2030, 2050 and even 2100 of the current book of business under
different IPCC RCP scenarios for hurricane and wildfire risk. These studies provide leadership with insights
into the long-term emergence of climate risk under moderate to stressed conditions.
USAA uses an investment manager to oversee the investment portfolios. This manager utilizes climate
modeling that analyzes risks such as temperature change, precipitation, sea level increase, wind damage,
and storm surge. They then convert these physical risks into the potential economic impacts. Moreover,
policies on reducing carbon emissions and exposure to regulatory risks are also considered. Based on
these estimates, the manager then assesses the impacts to USAA’s investment portfolio. Their model
considers both short and long-term risks.
Finally, climate risks are also assessed at the enterprise level through many risk management practices
defined in the ERMF, including identification of Top Risks and Emerging Risks to the enterprise. USA's
Enterprise Stress Test scenarios for the past several years have featured natural catastrophe events that
align with the most commonly accepted industry viewpoints. These catastrophe event scenarios are used
to stress not only P&C financials and reinsurance markets, but also to prompt enterprise-wide analysis,
around mortality assumptions, impact to USAA offices, credit worthiness of members, and other
economic implications.

USAA strives to provide comprehensive insurance coverage to its members. Active-duty members cannot
choose where they live, and many live in catastrophe-prone areas. The IPCC Assessment Report 6 (AR6)
highlighted with high confidence that the risk of major hurricanes, wildfires and inland flooding is
expected to increase in the future. USAA monitors and manages these risks through strong catastrophe
risk management routines with catastrophe modeling results providing a foundation to appropriately
quantify the risk.

‘* Hurricanes represent USAA’s largest natural catastrophe threat to capital. Various industry global
climate models and research suggest that tropical cyclone storm intensity and hurricane-induced
precipitation may increase due to warmer sea surface temperatures and higher moisture content in
the atmosphere, leading to higher insured losses and higher societal costs. This is exacerbated when
combined with increasing property values and population growth in catastrophe-prone areas. USAA is
committed to preserving its financial strength over the long-term, taking the uncertainties surrounding
natural catastrophes into consideration when setting conservative capital requirements, as discussed
in response to question two. USAA’s pricing and planning are based on industry-leading hurricane

15

catastrophe modeling results, with multiple hurricane models available for consideration. In addition,
USAA partnered with a catastrophe model vendor to assess USAA’s long-term future hurricane risk,
given an IPCC industry scenario with future sea level rise estimates also incorporated. Such analyses
give USA leadership further confidence in the robust nature of the catastrophe risk management
routines to flex with changing climate and economic conditions.

‘Storm Surge and Flood industry research points to a rise in global sea levels, increasing the impacts of
storm surge from hurricane events. USAA’s current insured exposure to storm surge risk is greatly
mitigated through the use of coastal underwriting restrictions. In the areas with coastal underwriting
restrictions, high storm surge exposures are only written when members meet exceptional
requirements, such as an IBHS fortified home. Flood risk represents less than 1% of USAA’s catastrophe
exposure ~ the majority of which corresponds to the renters and automobile lines of business. Storm
surge and hurricane precipitation are included in the hurricane catastrophe model results. The
remaining flood risk is modeled through an Inland Flood catastrophe model

* Wildfires have been increasing in frequency and severity due to the effects of land development in the
Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), untamed vegetation, and seasonal drought conditions. USAA uses
robust catastrophe models to assess wildfire risk at the individual address level as well as at an
aggregate level. In addition, USAA partnered with a catastrophe model vendor to assess USAA’s long-
term future wildfire risk, given an IPCC industry scenario. As with the hurricane risk, such analyses give
USAA leadership further confidence in the robust nature of the catastrophe risk management routines
to flex with changing climate and economic conditions.

Finally, prevention efforts are being expanded to further protect members. A few examples follow.

© Wildfire Response Program: One of several mitigation benefits offered to members in 14 states
most susceptible to wildfires is a wildfire response program through three different vendors.
Members in those states who have a USAA homeowners or rental property insurance policy are
automatically enrolled in the program at no additional cost. The vendors monitor wildfire activity
and take proactive mitigation measures to help protect USAA members’ properties when an
active wildfire burns nearby. In the program, certified wildland firefighters safely go behind fire
lines (with permission from the Incident Commander) to assess potential risk and assist with
mitigation efforts. These firefighters go into an evacuation zone to member homes before a fire
reaches them and take measures to help prevent a loss (reinforcing mitigation actions members
should also perform, such as closing windows and garage doors, moving wood piles away from
the homes, clearing debris from under wood decks, clearing gutters, and removing debris from
rooftops). After the fire sweeps through the area, wildland firefighters may go back to members’
homes and ensure no spot fires are smoldering that could cause additional damage.

© USAA’s Property Risk Assessment Tool: Too often, homebuyers purchase a property only to learn
later that it is in an area prone to natural disasters. USAA’s Property Risk Assessment Tool helps
members eliminate those surprises. The online tool enables members to enter the address of any
U.S. home and get information about the property's general exposure to various natural disasters,
such as wildfire and flood. It also offers tips on how to reduce the likelihood or impact of loss.

© Firewise Communities: USAA actively supports the development of recognized Firewise
Communities, which decrease the risk of loss due to wildfires. USAA offers an insurance discount
for homes in communities with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) “Firewise”
designation. USAA also actively partners with many state and local government agencies to
promote Firewise principles and help communities learn best practices to address local fire
conditions. USAA also actively supports research to determine which factors motivate
communities to choose to become Firewise.

16

There is much uncertainty around the future impact of climate change on Severe Thunderstorm and
Winter Storm risks. Multiple catastrophe models are used to measure these catastrophe risks, with
innovative approaches to bring results in line with actual USAA historical loss experience.
USAA has a Catastrophe Risk Management unit that monitors risks posed by natural catastrophes,
including the long-term impact that climate risk trends could have on natural catastrophes. USAA uses a
suite of catastrophe models licensed from well-known and well-respected vendors. The Catastrophe Risk
Management unit has dedicated a team of highly skilled staff to run these models internally, validate the
models, monitor results, and improve how the modeled results reflect USAA’s specific catastrophe risk
through various innovative approaches. Catastrophe model results are updated monthly to track the
impact of exposure changes on projected losses (Average Annual Loss, Tail Value-At-Risk, and Probable
Maximum Loss). Concentration risk routines are also executed regularly, with action plans to reduce risk
when thresholds are exceeded. These risk management routines, along with a robust reinsurance
program, protect the financial stability of the association against unacceptable catastrophe risk as it
evolves over time.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
USAA uses the “Climate Registry: General Reporting Protocol” and the “Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard” to collect activity data and calculate emissions. The
operational control boundary method is used to define the reporting boundary for climate-related
impacts for the enterprise. In accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, USAA reports both
location-based and market-based Scope 2 emissions. USAA’s efforts are focused on Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions.

Metric 2019 2020, | 2021-2022, | 2023

Scope 1 emissions (metrics tons CO2e) 13,277 | 6,676

Scope 2 emissions: Market-based method | 59,167 | 49,872

sustainable transportation alternatives. We will encourage remote work and support
electric or hybrid vehicles.

* Long Term (10-30 years): UHA will focus on infrastructure resilience, report on carbon
reduction progress, and continuously improve based on performance and new best
practices. We will collaborate with industry peers and environmental organizations to
share resources and explore carbon offset partnerships. We are also developing a long-
term climate adaptation strategy that includes investing in climate-resilient healthcare
technologies and exploring opportunities for community-wide climate adaptation
projects.

Impact on Business, Strategy, and Financial Planning: Climate-related risks and opportunities
impact UHA’s operations, strategy, and financial planning. UHA supports the transition to a low-
carbon economy by promoting healthier lifestyles, investing in social determinants of health,
updating facilities for environmental sustainability, and advocating for sustainable practices. We
are also integrating climate risk assessments into our financial planning and investment decisions
to enhance long-term sustainability.

Climate Change Resilience Strategy: UHA’s strategy integrates various climate-related
scenarios, including extreme heat, cold weather, wildfires, flooding, and power outages, into our
planning. This approach enhances our adaptability and prepares us to improve the HRSN benefit

STRATEGY RESPONSE:
One of our primary weather-related risks is hurricanes. The geographic areas affected are the New England
and New York coastlines and inland depending on the storm track. The biggest exposure to hurricane risk is
property, specifically dwellings and buildings along the coast. We utilize proprietary Hurricane Precision
Rating (HPR) and Modeled Catastrophe Premium (MCP) that allows us to provide a market for risks in the
catastrophe-prone areas by ensuring adequate premium is charged for those risks with the highest reinsurance
load. When considering geographic or line of business expansion, we carefully consider how the proposed
expansion will affect the spread of catastrophe risk. We do this to mitigate on-going reinsurance costs and
associated policy holder premiums.
While there is no formalized plan in place, the companies have and will continue to seek and implement ways
to reduce our energy usage and carbon footprint i.e., updated lighting and HVAC within our facility. Our
facility now utilizes LED lighting technology in 100% of applicable areas. Within the IT area we have
implemented virtual servers and desktop environments substantially reducing the number of servers on-site
along with the associated power and cooling requirements. In late 2016, we moved a substantial portion of our
IT infrastructure to the Cloud, taking advantage of centralized economies of scale in power and cooling while
offloading those from our local facility. The move to cloud-based economies of scale continues today.
‘We attempt to educate insureds and agents via loss control materials, website and social media postings. We
believe there are many losses that can be reduced in severity and possibly prevented through prudent loss,
control education. In 2023, we partnered with an automated water-shut off company to offer their product to
our insureds at a reduced price.

supported by two segment-level Management Risk Committees (MRCs),
one focusing on life, annuity, and PRT business risks and one focusing on
property and casualty business risks. The MRCs include risk officers for
the business segments, committee members, and other Company
employees with relevant expertise. In addition, several other senior
management committees support the discussion and enforcement of risk
management.
The Enterprise Risk Management Committee and Management Risk
Committee structure strengthens and promotes the discussion of ERM at
multiple levels and allows a feedback loop between operating areas,
senior management, and the Board. The CROs meet frequently to
collaborate on ERM projects, processes, and methods as well as share
status updates on the organization’s risk profile.
‘At the entity level, Farm Family Casualty Insurance Company and United
Farm Family Insurance Company have approved and adopted a Climate
Change Risk Policy (Risk Policy) and have directed management to
integrate the consideration, assessment, and management of climate
risks into risk management structures, processes, and functions in
accordance with such Risk Policy, with the goal of compliance with the
expectations set forth in the Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on
Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change.
‘The Companies’ ERM program identifies and analyzes risks and mitigation
strategies. As part of the risk quantification aspect of this program, the
Companies use commercially available catastrophe models to model
hurricanes, severe convective storms, earthquakes (with fire following),
winter storms, and wildfires. These models use data updated to reflect
insights obtained from observations made during recent natural
catastrophic events. The Companies continue to work with reinsurers and

organizations such as the Insurance Institute for Business and Home
Safety (IBHS) in understanding climate change, its potential impact, and
potential mitigation actions.
Investment activities, including setting investment policies and defining
acceptable risk levels, are subject to oversight by the Board, which is
assisted by the Investment Committee, the Asset-Liability Management
(ALM) Committee, and Enterprise Risk Management Committee. Climate
change risk has not been identified as a discrete risk among the
significant investment market risk factors for the Companies. The
potential for climate change risk impacting the Companies’ portfolios is,
addressed holistically and not isolated to a particular investment type.
‘Accordingly, the Companies’ risk monitoring, beginning with asset
allocation through individual asset purchase limits, assists with
monitoring each individual risk.
When considering individual investments as well as the aggregate amount
of investment categories, the Companies consider risks beyond the
traditional investing frameworks of credit worthiness and growth
potential. A holistic approach to investment risk considers political,
macroeconomic, environmental, and potential correlations with other
risks the Companies accept. For example, for the property and casualty
Companies, climate risk is often associated with underwriting risks that
the Company manages with geographic concentration analysis and
reinsurance. A large loss may impact the Company's underwriting results,
reinsurance collectability, and the credit quality of the reinsurance panel
Reinsurance capacity may also be affected. Similarly, societal initiatives
to reduce carbon emissions may impact private or municipally owned
electric utilities as well as global demand for fossil fuels, which may
impact asset values of investments held by the Companies.
‘The Companies also believe that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which
holds that all known risks are discounted in the current price of an
investment asset, adequately discounts risks such as climate change by
the pricing mechanism inherent within capital markets. Risks such as
climate change are discounted within the price of an individual asset.

‘The Companies also believe that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which

adequately discounts risks such as climate change by the pricing
mechanism inherent within capital markets.

‘The Company's ERM program includes various processes for identifying

and assessing risks, including climate-related risks. In particular, the

Company conducts a risk assessment across the enterprise. Each
identified risk in the inventory has a risk owner responsible for specifying
mitigating actions as well as assessing the likelihood, severity, and
velocity of each risk both gross and net of mitigation. An inventory of
emerging risks is also maintained and reviewed on a regular basis with
the risk committees. An inventory of Key Risk Indicators (KRIS) is also
maintained to monitor risks from various sources. The Own Risk and
Solvency Assessment (YORSA"") is conducted annually along with the filing
of the ORSA Summary report. The ORSA laws require the Company to
maintain a framework for annually identifying, assessing, monitoring,
managing, and reporting on “material and relevant risks” associated with
current and future business plans.
‘The Company's annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment includes
stress testing via realistic disaster scenarios. One of the scenarios utilizes
an internally developed hurricane wind-field model to measure the net
impact of a severe hurricane.
The Company also manages climate-related risks through its business
continuity and disaster recovery plans. The Company has five primary
office locations in Texas, Missouri, and New York, and most employees
are able to work from their homes. This workforce distribution helps the
Company to manage the risk that any one office location or region is,
impacted by a climate-related event.

storms when preparing our property CAT reinsurance profile, thereby linking our
business needs (appropriately structuring a reinsurance program) to our exposure to
extreme weather events. Furthermore, UFG now includes wind and hail deductibles

UFG's exposure to climate-related risks in these geographies.
UFG has developed a robust business continuity plan that we can roll out in

offices. The business continuity plan was developed in the wake of the company's
experience with the 2008 flood in Cedar Rapids. Following these disasters, we

standards to manage these exposures through individual risk selection, subject
to regulatory constraints, and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance
coverage.

TCFD-ALIGNED QUESTIONS
UPDATED 2022
GOVERNANCE
1. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
In disclosing the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities insurers should consider
including the following:

* Identify and include any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and opportunities.

* Describe where climate-related disclosure is handled within the insurer’s structure, e.g., at a group level,

entity level, or a combination. If handled at the group level, describe what activities are undertaken at the

company level.

A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and

opportunities.

In describing the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the climate-
related financial risks, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the

climate-related financial risks.

B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Response: United Heritage Life Insurance Company (UHLIC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of United
Heritage Financial Group, Inc. (UHFG). Climate-related risks and opportunities are identified,
assessed, and managed by the UHLIC executive leadership team, working in concert with the UHFG
executive leadership team. Responsibility for and oversight of climate-related financial risk
management in UHLIC and the overall United Heritage enterprise ultimately rests with the UHFG
Board of Directors (BOD), with specific responsibility delegated to the UHFG BOD Risk Committee.
Our current investment policies are also overseen by the UHFG BOD Investment Committee and
provide for broad diversification and risk mitigation.

As a life insurer primarily focused on individual insurance products (whole life and annuities) and
group insurance products (term life, disability, vision, accident coverage and critical illness), UHLIC's
exposure to climate-related risks is low. Although the UHLIC executive leadership team is continually
identifying, assessing, and managing key risks and opportunities related to Environmental, Social
and Governance (ESG) factors, UHLIC does not have any publicly stated goals on climate-related
risks and opportunities.
STRATEGY

2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's

businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.

In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s businesses,
strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and

resiliency. *

* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its operations

or organizations. *

A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium,
and long term.
In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium, and
longer term, insurers should consider including the following:
* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short term, 5-10 years as
medium term, and 10-30 years as long term.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business, strategy, and
financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and financial
planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low
carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
Response: As noted in the Governance Narrative above, UHLIC is a life insurer and the actual and
potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities to UHLIC's business are low. UHLIC
does not provide insurance products or services that support the transition to a low carbon economy
or help customers adapt to climate-related risk, and based on UHLIC’s product portfolio, no need has
been identified to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk and resiliency. Accordingly,
UHLIC has not currently identified any short-, medium-, or long-term climate-related risks or
opportunities.
Climate-related initiatives are part of the United Heritage’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
program that incorporates ESG risks. UHLIC’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and good
faith efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy include the following at UHLIC headquarters in
Meridian, Idaho: encouragement of recycling (including paper, plastic, furniture and office equipment
products), investments in electric vehicle charging stations and solar panels, and offering hybrid and
fully remote work schedules.
RISK MANAGEMENT
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers
should consider including the following:
* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting portfolio, and
how the company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to physical, transition and liability
risk. *
* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential physical
and transition climate related risks, if applicable. *
* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment portfolio,
including what investment classes have been considered. *
A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers should consider
including the following:
* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how frequently
the process is completed. *

B. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into
the insurer's overall risk management.
In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the
insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's general enterprise-risk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.
Response: As set forth in the Governance and Strategy Narratives above, although UHLIC’s
exposure to climate-related risks is low, any such key risks are identified, assessed, and managed
through the ERM framework and brought before the UHFG BOD Risk Committee on an as-identified
basis.
The ERM framework, facilitated by the UHFG's Chief Risk Officer, has a consistent taxonomy to
identify, assess, and manage strategic, financial, operational, technology, governance and
compliance risks. As risks are identified, they are assessed for defined levels of impact, probability,
velocity, and related controls to ensure the company is within the tolerable risk appetite. Based on
the results of these measurements, resources are prioritized and applied to address those risks to
bring them within appropriate tolerance levels. As with all risks and their resulting risk response,
ongoing monitoring is in place to ascertain residual risk and the necessity for additional action.
UHLIC's underwriting portfolio faces minimal impact from climate-related risk, UHLIC does not utilize
climate scenarios in analyzing underwriting or investment portfolio risks, and UHLIC does not
engage with its policyholders regarding climate-related risks.
UHLIC has not performed a detailed climate scenario analysis on its investment portfolio in an
attempt to quantify climate-related risks. Measurable ESG ratings for investments are still in their
infancy and there are currently no standardized ratings that can be used to accurately determine
ESG exposure. Our current investment policies, overseen by the UHFG BOD Investment Committee,
provide for broad diversification and risk management.
METRICS AND TARGETS
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your business.
Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to assess, if any.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:

* In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate
scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount
of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related
risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
Response: UHLIC does not consider climate-related risks to be material to current business and
accordingly does not utilize metrics or targets specific to climate-related risks.

Company Response: United Security Insurance Company is a privately held stock insurance company which has an
internal board that is responsible for the Company's corporate governance, including risks and opportunities. The
‘Company acknowledges the importance of climate-related risks to the industry and its regulatory agencies and is
committed to following initiatives wherever possible, while helping the Company achieve their goals. To that end the
Company has created an Enterprise Risk Management Committee which is responsible for identifying, assessing,
mitigating and managing risks.

The Company writes primarily private passenger auto liability policies, which accounts for approximately 87% of total
premium written. Due to the nature of the Company's business concentration and the fact that we operate in 8 states,
the Company does not believe that climate-related risks will have a significant impact on the Company's corporate
governance, strategies, or risk management.

delivery of policy documents and invoices, imaging of documents and automating workflows, which reduces paper
usage. In addition, the Company has adopted a hybrid, work from home model to reduce miles driven and fuel
consumption. When possible, the Company utilizes conference calls, online meetings and webinars in place of travel.
RISK MANAGEMENT
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers

Company Response: Historically the Company has not incurred any losses related to a catastrophic event which have
had an adverse impact on its operations or cash flow. The main CAT exposure to the Company is from severe
convection storms, and to a lesser degree flooding, tornados, and hurricanes. On an annual basis the Company partners
with their reinsurer to model its potential exposure to catastrophic losses. The Reinsurance Committee works together
with the ERM Committee to assess the Company’s exposure to catastrophic type losses. As mentioned previously, the
majority of the Company's premiums are associated with liability auto coverage and our policy holders are not
geographically concentrated. Due to the nature of the Company's business model, the Company believes that the risk
to climate-related risks is very low. However, to mitigate the Company's exposure to catastrophic losses the Company
purchases CAT reinsurance coverage from a highly rated reinsurer.

Directors and is comprised of the Company’s Chief Actuary, Chief Risk
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer, and General
Counsel.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and
opportunities.

adjustments in property catastrophe models designed to account for climate
conditions in the near future. The Company consulted the RMS near-term event
catalogue to evaluate wind exposure within the Company’s United States
operating footprint. The Company consults the AIR Warm Sea Surface
Temperature event catalogue to evaluate additional exposures within the
Company's United States operating footprint.
STRATEGY
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on
the insurer’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is
material.
In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and
opportunities on the insurer's businesses, strategy and financial planning, insurers
should consider including the following:
* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic
of climate risk and resiliency. *
© The Company participates in and is a member of industry trade associations
whose interests include engaging with federal and state governments on the
topics of climate-related risk and resiliency when raised as a regulatory issue.
The Company and FFH also engage with rating agencies, whose criteria include
the topics of climate-related risk and resiliency.
* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas.
emissions in its operations or organizations. *
© The Company assesses, reduces, and/or mitigates its greenhouse gas
emissions in its operations or organizations by: (a) embracing the digitization of
2

the insurance industry and implementing a hybrid work model, thereby reducing
greenhouse gas emissions attributable to its operations; (b) subleasing,
returning, non-renewing, or selling unused or underutilized portions of its
existing onsite locations, thereby reducing its physical resource demands; (c)
incorporating principles of conservation and climate resiliency in its physical
office operations and design, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
resource demands on a going -forward basis where practicable; (d) facilitating
the use of remote technology for meetings in lieu of physical travel: (e)
facilitating the use of recyclable or compostable single-use food containers, as
well as the use of reusable supplies, at its onsite locations, thereby reducing
resources demands at its physical locations; and (f) encouraging the use of
energy conservation technology at its onsite locations, thereby reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and resource demands attributable to its operations.
A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over
the short, medium, and long term. In describing the climate-related risks and
opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium, and longer term,
insurers should consider including the following:
e Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short term, 5-
10 years as medium term, and 10-30 years as long term.

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s
business, strategy, and financial planning. In describing the impact of climate-related
risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and financial planning,
insurers should consider including the following:

* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the
transition to a low carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related
risk.

risks. The Company’s Surplus and Specialty division underwrites certain
insurance risks of biofuel production facilities, windfarms, solar arrays and
installations, and other alternative energy facilities, as well as contractors in the
commercial solar, wind, biomass energy conversion, and landfill gas-to-energy
fields.

* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low
carbon economy.
© Asdescribed above, the Company invests in the transition to a low carbon

economy by: (a) embracing the digitization of the insurance industry and
implementing a hybrid work model: (b) subleasing, returning, non-renewing, or

with climate-related financial risks being a factor considered when making
investment management decisions.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer’s strategy, taking into consideration different
climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

* The Company adheres to a rigorous, long-term approach to manage and
monitor its exposure to weather-related catastrophes, some of which may have
increased in frequency or severity due to climate-related risk. The primary goal
of the Company’s risk management framework is to ensure the outcomes of
activities involving climate-related risk remained consistent with the Company's
risk appetite and risk tolerance levels, while maintaining an appropriate balance
between risk and reward. Although the Company's catastrophe risk models
cannot accurately account for material risks arising from specific degrees
Celsius of warming global temperatures with a high level of confidence, the
Company attempts to calibrate its catastrophe risk-models to account for
current and prospective climate conditions.

RISK MANAGEMENT
3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.

In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks,

insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its
underwriting portfolio, and how the company is managing its underwriting exposure
with respect to physical, transition and liability risk. *
© The Company relies upon the availability and quality of reinsurance, near-term

catastrophe risk models, and underwriting guidelines to manage the impact and
underwriting exposure of climate-related risks upon the Company's
underwriting portfolio. The Company accounts for aggregated risk due to
climate-change on a group-wide basis using its ERM framework and coordinates
its activities with FFH’s global risk committee. In addition, the Company relies
upon the relativity short-terms of insurance policies most exposed to climate-
related risks, such as property insurance. The Company evaluates, and intends
to continue evaluating, liability risks arising from climate-related risk.

* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage
their potential physical and transition climate related risks, if applicable. *
© The Company makes available to its insureds risk engineering

recommendations and educational materials emphasizing safety, property

preservation, and risk reduction, as well as the risks presented by weather

conditions such as hurricane, tornado, hail, wind, storm surge, flood, extreme
5

heat and cold, drought, and wildfire. The Company also relies upon risk-based
pricing and avoidance to create market conditions incentivizing insureds to
manage any of their physical and transition climate-related risks.

* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its,
investment portfolio, including what investment classes have been considered. *
© EFH directs investments in Company's investment portfolio, with climate-

related financial risks being one of the factors considered when making an
investment management decision. FFH invests on a long-term basis in
accordance with applicable insurance regulatory guidelines to ensure the
preservation of invested capital for policyholder protection. Investments are
made using a long-term value-investing approach, thereby investing in securities
of companies and other entities at prices below their underlying long-term
values to protect capital from loss and earn income over time and provide
operating income as needed.

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related
risks. In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-
related risks, insurers should consider including the following:

* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications
and how frequently the process is completed. *
© The Company’s process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks

relies upon the Company’s existing ERM framework and those of its
Corporate Risk Committee in coordination with FFH’s global risk committee
and ERM framework, The Company captures and assesses data from the
following sources: (a) catastrophe risk models; (b) pricing signals from the
reinsurance and primary risk marketplaces: (c) regulatory signals; and (di
feedback from loss control inspections. The Company conducted stress
tests that assessed the financial implications of catastrophes.

B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.

* The Company's ERM framework and Corporate Risk Committee take a group-
wide approach to manage risk, including climate-related risk, in coordination
with FFH’s global risk committee and ERM framework. The Company uses
modeling and judgement to assign a probability of a climate-related risk
negatively affecting the underwriting performance of a business unit, with such
climate-related risks being weighed against non-climate-related material risks
relevantto the business unit, such as credit risk, market risk, and premium and
reserve risk. The Company then seeks to balance the overall risks of the retained
risk in the insurance portfolio to maintain profitability of the Company.

C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related
risks are integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management. In describing how
processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management, insurers should consider
including the following:

6

* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s
general enterprise-risk management process or a separate process and how
frequently the process is completed.
© The Company addresses climate-related risks through its existing ERM

process and Corporate Risk Committee, in coordination with FFH’s global
risk committee and ERM framework. The Company’s Corporate Risk
Committee meets at least quarterly and often monthly.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting
risks, including which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of
scenarios are used, and what timeframes are considered.
© The Company conducts probabilities analysis on a quarterly basis to stress

test exposure to wind and severe connective storm.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its
investments, including which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios
are used, and what timeframes are considered.
© EFH directs and manages the Company's investment portfolio, with climate-

related financial risks being one of the factors considered when making an
investment management decision. FFH invests on a long-term basis in
accordance with applicable insurance regulatory guidelines to ensure the
preservation of invested capital for policyholder protection. Investments are
made using long-term value-investing approach thereby investing in
securities of companies and other entities at prices below their underlying
long-term values to protect capital from loss and earn income over time and
provide operating income as needed.
METRICS AND TARGETS
4, Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized
risks and opportunities where such information is material. In disclosing the metrics
and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:

* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related
risks to your business. Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer
uses catastrophe models to assess, if any.

2023,2023_United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York.pdf,"Section 1 Governance: Disclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks
and opportunities.

Response:

This response to the NAIC Climate Risk Survey is submitted on behalf of the indirect insurance
company subsidiaries of Corebridge Financial, Inc. (“Corebridge”), American General Life
Insurance Company, The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, and The United States Life
Insurance Company in the City of New York (each a “Corebridge Insurer,” and collectively, the
“Corebridge Insurers”). Except as otherwise provided herein, responses with respect to Corebridge
apply to the Corebridge Insurers.

In September 2022, American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) completed the initial public
offering of Corebridge. As of June 30, 2024, AIG owned approximately 49.0% percent of
Corebridge. Corebridge is continuing to mature its governance around climate-related risks and
opportunities in line with our industry, geographic and business focus.

The Corebridge Board of Directors (“Corebridge Board”) has oversight responsibility for the
management of risk for Corebridge. Corebridge management has the day-to-day responsibility for
assessing and managing Corebridge’s risk exposure, and the Corebridge Board and the Corebridge
Audit Committee provide oversight in connection with those efforts, with particular focus on
reviewing Corebridge’s most significant existing and emerging risks. One of the Corebridge Audit
Committee’s key responsibilities is assisting the Corebridge Board in its oversight of the
Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Corebridge Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, established in June 2024, has responsibility for overseeing
Corebridge’s policies, practices and reporting with respect to current and emerging public policy
issues of significance to Corebridge, including issues of significance relating to climate. The
oversight and management of climate-related risks would fall within this general governance
framework.

Corebridge considers risk management an integral part of our business strategy and a key element
of our approach to corporate governance. We have an integrated process for managing risks
throughout our organization in accordance with our firmwide risk appetite. Management of
climate-related risks is subsumed within this integrated process.

In addition, the boards of directors of the Corebridge Insurers are responsible for the oversight of
climate risk and opportunities for the Corebridge Insurers. The Chief Investment Officer has been
designated as the board member and member of senior management responsible for climate risk
of the Corebridge Insurers. Periodic updates regarding climate risk are presented to the senior
management team and the Corebridge Insurer boards as appropriate. In 2024, a management
council (the “Sustainability Council”) was formed to consider sustainability-related issues,
including climate. The Council includes participation from the areas of investments, risk,
operations, investor relations and other periodic invitees.

Section 2 Strategy: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and
opportunities _on the insurer’s business, strategy, and financial planning where such
information is material.

Response:

Corebridge is a leading provider of retirement solutions and life insurance products in the United
States. Our primary business operations consist of sales of individual and group annuity products,
life insurance products to individuals and institutional markets products.

Corebridge considers the impacts of climate-related risks as discussed herein on our business,
operations, investments and financial condition, including but not limited to, potential direct
physical impacts and indirect effects due to transition risks, and those potentially arising from new
laws and regulations.

Physical Risks

Acute physical risks due to impacts from the climate may result in increased frequency and severity
of natural catastrophes. Catastrophes, including those associated with climate-related risks may
adversely affect our business and financial condition. This in turn could potentially affect
operational risks associated with business activities of Corebridge or third parties that Corebridge
relies upon to provide and adequately perform certain business, operations, investment advisory,
functional support and administrative services on our behalf, as well as business continuity risks.
In the event of a natural catastrophe disaster, unanticipated problems with our business continuity
plans could cause a material adverse effect on our disaster recovery or business, results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity. We could also experience a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of our insurance business
due to increased mortality and, in certain cases, morbidity rates and/or its impact on the economy
and financial markets. Additionally, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of our
reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries.

Investment Management and Related Risks

We manage general and separate account assets, and thus investment management is an integral
part of our business model. We aim to support our liabilities with a high quality and diversified
portfolio taking into consideration liability duration, convexity and liquidity profile. In addition,
we seek to originate assets that enable us to further manage our asset-liability profile, generate
enhanced risk-adjusted returns and iterate our product designs to improve our risk profile. Climate
-related risks, including physical and transition risk, may adversely affect the value of the securities
that we hold or lead to increased credit risk of other counterparties we transact business with,
including reinsurers. There is a risk that some asset sectors could face significantly higher costs
and a disorderly adjustment to asset values leading to an adverse impact on the value and future
performance of investment assets as a result of climate-related risks, and regulatory or other
responses thereto.

Transition Risks/Stakeholder Expectations

Our reputation or corporate brand could also be negatively impacted as a result of changing
customer or societal perceptions of organizations that we do business with or invest in due to their
actions (or lack thereof) with respect to climate-related risks. A failure to identify and address
these issues could cause a material adverse effect on the achievement of our strategies and
potentially subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, Corebridge may face
increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other
stakeholders regarding environmental and other related matters, including climate risks.
Legislators and regulators have imposed and likely will continue to impose environmental
legislation, rules and guidance, which may conflict with one another and impose additional costs
‘on us, block or impede our business opportunities, including by restricting contracting with state
governmental authorities or by imposing divestment requirements, or expose us to new or
additional risks.

Moreover, certain organizations that provide information, including information to investors, have
developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to different environmental and other
related matters. A lack of ratings or unfavorable ratings of our company or our industry may lead
to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries.
Additionally, the costs incurred to comply with, or our inability to meet, applicable requirements,
expectations, laws or regulations, some of which may be in contradiction with each other, could
result in adverse publicity, reputational harm, loss of business opportunities, or loss of customer
and/or investor confidence, each of which individually or in the aggregate could adversely affect
our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Section 3 Risk Management: Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages
climate-related risks.

Response:

As stated above, we consider risk management an integral part of our business strategy and a key
element of our approach to corporate governance. We have an integrated process for managing
risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. The Corebridge
Board has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Management has the day-to-day
responsibility for assessing and managing Corebridge’s risk exposure, and the Corebridge Board
and the Corebridge Audit Committee provide oversight in connection with those efforts, with
particular focus on reviewing Corebridge’s most significant existing and emerging risks. Such
oversight is in addition to the oversight of the Corebridge Nominating and Governance
Committee’s oversight of issues of significance relating to climate, as described above in the
response to Section 1.

Corebridge’s investment strategies involve considerations that include local and general market
and economic conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility

constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax, regulatory and legal
investment limitations, and, as applicable, climate and other related, considerations.

‘We manage operational risk related to climate through, among other things, our business resiliency
program. Our program and policies address planning for the business continuity of operations,
disaster recovery of technology infrastructure and event management, including incident response
and crisis management before, during and after possible disruptions.

Additionally, as part of our strategy, we continue to monitor evolving expectations from investors,
customers, regulators and other stakeholders, including in connection with climate-related risk.
Section 4 Metrics and Targets: Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage
relevant collateralized risks and opportunities where such information is material.
Response:

As Corebridge has become a stand-alone business, we expect to further assess and evaluate
climate-related risks, including consideration of whether and which metrics might assist in
assessing and managing relevant risks and opportunities.

For applicable responses to close-ended questions, please see the relevant sections above.

is identified as the lead state regulator for purposes of reporting according to the NAIC under
NAIC Group Code 0071.

A, CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION
The information being provided in this CRDS is submitted pursuant to the provisions of Ruling
Letter No. CN-2022-316-AF of June 9, 2022 and its contents and information contained herein,
as well as any supporting documentation that may be submitted along with this document or as a
result of this document are considered confidential and privileged and will not be subject to
public inspection. Therefore, the OCI as the lead state regulator in this exercise, recognizes the
information and documentation included herein as being proprietary and containing trade secrets.
All those documents, materials, or other information shall be confidential by law and privileged.
Therefore, they shall not be subject to disclosure by the Commissioner. However, UGI
acknowledges and accepts that the OCI, in the performance of its duties may share the
information, documents, and reports included in this form with the NAIC and other state, federal,
and international enforcement agencies for the insurance industry, provided they agree not to
disclose this information.

B. GOVERNANCE
For purposes of this CRDS, UGI has opted to provide information on climate risk related
activities that occur at UGI, which is the ultimate controlling parent level for all of its
subsidiaries and affiliated entities. This level of disclosure has been chosen as UGI is the level at
which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of its subsidiaries and
affiliated entities are overseen collectively and at which supervision of those factors are
coordinated and exercised.
UGI has embraced the climate risk topic as part of its culture, UGI and its subsidiaries write
commercial, auto and residential property coverage in areas that are exposed to damage from
hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires and severe storms; the severity, frequency and
intensity of which may be affected by climate change and other unforeseen or unpredictable
‘occurrences. A natural catastrophe could cause property damage to a large number of
policyholders, which would result in significantly increased losses. Management attempts to
mitigate these risks through its conservative philosophy toward our extensive reinsurance
program. We use, and we expect to continue to use, reinsurance to help manage our exposure to
property and casualty risks, as well as for our life insurance and annuity business

On November 15, 2023, the Group entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell 100%
of the stock of UIHNA, mainly subject to regulatory approval from the Texas Department
of Insurance (TDI). Form-A from buyer was submitted on February 2, 2024 to TDI and is
pending approval as of the date of this report.
It is important to note that UGI provides shared services for all its subsidiaries and affiliates.
These shared services consist of legal, accounting, finance, investment, risk management, and
human resources support to the corresponding departments and functions of its affiliates and
subsidiaries. In addition, UGI's Board of Directors and its Board Committees have direct
oversight over all its subsidiaries and affiliates.
Each company that belongs to UGI has its own Board of Directors. These Boards share some of
the same Directors as the Board of UGI. However, the overall strategy, risk appetite,
performance monitoring and compliance is established and supervised by the Board of
Directors of UGI

The subsidiaries day to day business is conducted by its employees, directors and officers,
under the direction of the President of each particular subsidiary and the oversight of the
subsidiary’s and UGI Board and its standing committees. The Board monitors the performance
of the President, the various officers, and other senior management of each subsidiary to assure
that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being addressed and to ensure profitability,
compliance and solvency of the operation.
The Boards of each subsidiary and UGI are committed to engendering a culture of compliance
and risk management with respect to all applicable regulatory requirements wherever their
business is conducted. In addition, UGI's Board always strives to adhere and comply with
industry corporate governance best practices, including climate risk identification and
management.

Corporate Structure:
UGI’s Board with the help and input from the Group ERM Advisory Committee, is responsible
for the governance of climate risk by ensuring that management maintains a sound system of risk
management and internal controls to safeguard shareholder’s interests and UGI’s assets, and
evaluates and determines, along with the senior management team, the nature and extent of the
risks which UGL is willing to take in achieving strategic objectives.
The climate risks are proactively identified and addressed utilizing a formalized, uniform, and
standard risk identification, prioritization and assessment methodology documented in a formal
ERM policy. These Risk Identification and Assessment exercises are conducted on an annual
basis, along with periodic strategy meetings of senior executives. The ownership of these risks
lies with the respective business and corporate executive heads with the stewardship residing
with the UGI management ERM Advisory Committee and finally the UGI Board.
Risk areas are reported to the UGI Board as a whole, as well as to the Audit and Investment
Committees by members of senior management (i.e. CEO, CFO, Chief Investment Officer, Chief
Information Officer, etc.), as well as the CRO for UGI. Findings and recommendations are
discussed at both the UGI Board level and at the corresponding Board Committee level. The
GRO continues to develop and implement a quarterly and annual reporting structure to facilitate
presentation of a risk profile for each entity, as well as for UGI as a whole. This reporting
structure will also help to provide uniformity in terminology and minimize the silo effect that
could exist without standardization of terminology and methodologies.

C. STRATEGY

Steps taken by Group to engage key constituencies to address on the topic of climate

risk and resiliency.
UGI’s and its subsidiaries key constituencies are its policyholder’s, producers, authorized
representatives, reinsurers, Enterprise Risk Management Unit (ERM) and branch service offices.
Producers and authorized representatives are a key constituency to keep policyholders engaged
in the wide array of resources available to help reduce risks and loss from natural events. UGI
and its subsidiaries periodically publish informational materials addressing policyholder

preparation and best practices prior to the beginning of hurricane season. In addition, many of
the producers, general agencies and authorized representatives that serve as UGI’s, and its
subsidiaries distribution channels make physical and virtual connections with many of our
policyholders to evaluate a policyholder’s performance and/or loss potential and offer
recommendations to assist them in their loss prevention efforts.
UGI is also very active in social initiatives such as: promoting changing local laws in Puerto
Rico in order to require windstorm reinsurance purchase from 1/100 years to 1/250 years; and,
promoting adequate property valuations. UGI is also an active participant in local and national
trade associations, including the Association of Insurance Companies of Puerto Rico and the
‘American Property Casualty Insurance Association.
Reinsurers are engaged through the evaluation of the UGI’s claims data from which they model
losses and analyze risk concentration. Climate related risks are included in their models.
‘As part of UGI’s commitment to its constituencies, we have participated in NAIC, CERES,
RIMS and other climate risk related webinars and workshops, as well as subscribed to their
newsletters and informational updates in order to stay abreast of new developments and
methodologies related to climate risk identification and metrics to be developed and
implemented over time. In addition, UGI and its ERM unit continue to evaluate the desirability
of joining the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS). This organization has the
IBHS Research Center, whose mission is to advance the scientific understanding of severe
weather perils and their interaction with the homes and businesses being insured at real scale.
Does Group have a plan to assess, reduce or mitigate its greenhouse emissions in its
‘operations or organization:
UGI and its Puerto Rico subsidiaries (UNICO and PGIC) have taken the following actions to
mitigate its greenhouse emissions in its operations and organization:

* Starting in 2018, UGI transitioned its Puerto Rico company car fleet to a mix of
hybrid and electric vehicles to reduce emissions caused by business travel via
automobile. In addition, UGI’s vehicle fleet is comprised of both owned and leased
vehicles. Rarely is a vehicle older than three years.

Implemented in 2009 UGI has an ongoing recycling program in all its operations.
This includes recycling of paper, plastic and aluminum with collections bins located
in designated areas.

© UGI has also transitioned to a mostly paperless environment, and we are actively
providing policyholders with subscription of business, notifications and claims
handling via electronic transactions rather than printed paper mailings for postal
delivery.

© UGThas increased the use of meetings via virtual platforms such as Microsoft Teams,
Zoom, WebEx, etc. in order to reduce emissions related to business travel.

© UGI has rolled out the installation of solar panels in various corporate office
buildings, including its Metro 2 building and its satellite service offices located
throughout Puerto Rico.

* UGI has an established Corporate Responsibility Program which includes the Luis
Miranda Casas Foundation, a not-for-profit organization founded by the Miranda
family in 2012, through its programs the Foundation invests in projects related to
environmental conservation and social initiatives.

UNA: UNA has taken the following actions to mitigate its greenhouse emissions in its operations
and organization:

* UNA has transitioned to work from home or hybrid work from home, reducing
emissions from commuting between home and office by over 50%.

* In addition, UNA has transitioned its company car fleet to hybrid vehicles to further
reduce emissions caused by business travel via automobile.

© UNA has increased its use of virtual meetings thereby reducing business travel and
emissions from business travel.

© UNA has increased its use of virtual tools for risk assessment in lieu of on-site
physical inspections, further reducing emissions.

* UNA participates in recycling paper, plastic and aluminum with collection bins
located throughout the corporate offices. Water coolers have replaced single use
plastic bottles in UNA’s office.

* UNA offers paperless document delivery options in some states, as permitted by law,
to reduce the use of paper and need for postal delivery.

Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the

short, medium and long term. (1-5 years as short term, 5-10 years as medium term, and

10-30 years as long term).
The geographic distribution of UGI’s and its subsidiaries business subjects us to catastrophic
exposures primarily in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico) and in the United States mainland. UGI’s
geographical concentration of risks in Puerto Rico is high for UNICO and PGIC as all its
business is conducted in Puerto Rico. Its geographical concentration of risk for UNA is also
high as a result of its homeowner’s business in high-risk coastal states such as Florida, Texas and
California. UGI has identified the following climate related risks for each time horizon defined
in this section:

© Hurricanes for Puerto Rico and for coastal states such as Florida, Texas, California;

© Severe thunderstorms throughout the 17 states in which UNA writes homeowner's
business;

© Hail storms in Texas for UNA;

© Wildfires in the state of California for UNA;

* Floods in Puerto Rico and in all states in which UNA does business;

* Earthquakes in Puerto Rico and in California;

© Possibility of Tsunami exposure in Puerto Rico and all coastal states in which UNA
does business.

The above mentioned catastrophe risks are examples of climate related risks that UGI has
identified that have direct impact on our operations and business. However, they are not an
exhaustive list and they are constantly being revised and updated.

Time horizons established by UGI:

1. Short term ~ UGI has defined short term as a time horizon comprised of 1 to 5 years.
This time horizon aligns with the average length of our Property & Casualty policies and
the time frame for which we perform detailed business plans. Risks and Opportunities
identified in this time horizon include:

a. Risks - Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate
conditions. This increased regulation may impact UGI and its customers.
Regulatory action may limit UGI’s ability to manage catastrophe risk. This may
occur when regulators or government pass legislation, executive orders or
directives that mandate a prohibition on insurers from reducing exposures or
withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas. In addition, insurers may be required
{0 participate in residual markets and/or guarantee associations. This type of
required participation has resulted in significant losses or assessments to insurers,
including UGI, especially it subsidiaries UNICO, PGIC and UNA.

In addition, in response to catastrophes or disasters, Regulators may also impose
moratoriums on policy cancellations or nonrenewal for nonpayment of premium,
establishing additional claims handling requirements or procedures; imposing
daily claim data reporting requirements; modifying adjuster licensing procedures
for independent and public adjusters. For example, new Florida law requires
UNA to stay on the risk until repairs are completed, Also, California limits and
restricts the use of CAT models. These were all risks that were experienced by
UNICO, PGIC and UNA as the direct impact of regulatory actions taken as a
result of Hurricanes Irma, Maria, Fiona, and Ian, as well as the repeated incidence
of earthquakes that affected the southern part of Puerto Rico. UNA and UGI are
currently evaluating the flooding effects to coastal areas and insured property
after the recent passing of Hurricane Emesto through the State of Florida and
Puerto Rico.

Climate-related regulation could increase our customers’ costs of doing business.
This increase in costs would affect our customers’ capital and their ability to
invest in loss prevention and safety features. Over time, this would also have a
negative impact on the number of insurable interests and businesses. Therefore,
affecting UGI’s and its subsidiaries’ profitability, as well as its business and
underwriting strategies.

b. Opportunities ~ Environmental legislation and regulation related to solar energy,
wind turbines, or other sustainable building related requirements or incentives,
could lead to an increase in demand for UGI’s products that respond to customer
needs resulting from these initiatives. Said initiatives could result in increased
sales of specialized insurance and surety products that are created to cover

renewable energy associated risks. We seek to balance our risk exposure so that
there is never too much exposure in any one type of business line.

2. Medium term — UGI has defined medium term as a time horizon comprised of 5 to 10
years. This time horizon aligns with UGI’s development of and execution of business
strategies that impact strategic planning and market related adjustments based on ongoing
or changing conditions. Risks and Opportunities identified in this time horizon are:

a. Risks ~ There is continued uncertainty as a result of the constant changes in
policy at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its local counterparts at
the state level. Especially dealing with applicability of regulations related to air
and water pollution, emission standards (i.e. greenhouse gas (GHG), carbon
dioxide emissions from coal fired electric steam generating units (EGUs),
incentives for renewable energy projects and for hybrid or electric vehicles. New,
tighter and more restrictive regulations could negatively impact the demand for
UG’s traditional insurance products and services.

b. Opportunities ~ Development of new products or services for renewable energy
businesses, as well as establishing renewable energy goals at the state and local
government levels. This, in turn, provides an opportunity to develop new
insurance products tailored to related markets. In addition, new auto emissions
regulations at the federal government level may lead to an increase in the demand,
production and availability of hybrid and electric vehicles. The increase in those
types of vehicles could lead to a corresponding increase in the demand for
UNICO’s and PGIC’s automobile insurance products for hybrid and electric
autos.

3. Long term ~ UGI has defined long term as a time horizon comprised of 10 to 30 years.
This time horizon aligns with longer term change such as climate-related risks, energy
consumption and energy sources that present risks and opportunities that are beyond
those mentioned above in short- and medium-term time horizons.

a. Risks ~ Changes in frequency and severity of catastrophe losses and uncertainty
surrounding weather volatility and climate related risk. Over the last twenty years
we have experienced an increase in catastrophe related losses due to a number of
potential factors: weather/climate variability, aging infrastructure, and more
people living in high-risk areas, population growth in areas with weaker
enforcement of building codes or outdated building codes, unreliability of flood
risk maps, among other factors. In addition, different government and industry
studies indicate that we are expected to continue to experience an increase in the
frequency and severity of hurricanes, heavy precipitation event, flash flooding,
sea level rise, droughts, heat waves and wildfires. This has been clearly
evidenced by the intensity of the recent hurricanes that have passed by Puerto
Rico and have hit the mainland United States, especially in Florida. Wildfires and
severe droughts have also increased in the West of the United States, especially in
California. This unpredictability may affect the reliability of the catastrophe
modeling that is currently being utilized.

b. Opportunities ~ Development of new products and initiatives to address the
developing needs of our customers and policyholders. There is also an
opportunity to participate in the review of legislation and outdated codes that need
to be revised to reflect our current and future realities. This includes, UGI’s
participation in revision of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, promoting changing
law to require windstorm reinsurance purchase from 1/100 years to 1/250 years,
promoting revisions to Puerto Rico’s general building code, promoting the
‘adequate valuation of property in both Puerto Rico and the jurisdictions in which
UNA does business. There is also the opportunity to create internal Risk Control
and/or Loss Control services and programs that can be offered to our clients
which can provide safety and loss prevention services that can help our customers
fo mitigate and minimize property losses caused by weather related events. This
in turn can help customers to improve their resiliency over time.
Products or services to support transition to low carbon economy or help customers
‘adapt to climate risk.
UNICO: UNICO’s underwriting includes providing products and services which support the
transition to low carbon economy and support customers as they adapt to climate risk. Our
underwriting guidelines promote this philosophy in all our lines of business by insuring hybrid
and electrical cars, solar panels, batteries and other hardware for our clients. We insure the
liability exposure of contractors of solar and integrated renewable solutions for homes and
business and our professional liability products allows us to cover engineers and other
professionals that design and build zero-carbon emission projects. Universal continuously
evaluates potential environmentally friendly opportunities and in fact has reinsurance capacity to
cover this type of risk.
UNA: UNA’s mission is to assist our policyholders in recovering from disasters including those
related to climate events. UNA offers its products in some of the most disaster-prone regions in
the country and provides protection against hurricanes, earthquake, tornado, wind and hail and
wildfire. UNA also offers flood coverage through an NFIP policy in all states and also offers a
private flood insurance option in Florida.
Does Group make investments to support transition to low carbon economy
Yes, UGI has started to create a bucket of environmental, green bonds and other social
sustainability Instruments within its portfolio. For the current year, UGI and its subsidiaries hold
approximately $25 million of these securities.
UGI intends to continue investing in these securities with a target of at least 5% of its total
portfolio in environmental friendly instruments.

We analyze the potential impact of climate-related changes as part of the strategic planning
process. UGI’s strategy to increase market share in the personal property-liability business and
expand protections offerings for customers is resistant to increased severe weather. After
experiencing severe catastrophe losses in 2017, UGI re-evaluated its underwriting of the
homeowner's business, which is now consistently profitable. Along with changing product
details and underwriting practices, UGI continued with its comprehensive catastrophe
reinsurance program to reduce certain risks. As a result, of our conservative approach and
successful creation of a solid and reliable reinsurance tower structure, UGI’s subsidiaries were
able to successfully weather Hurricanes Maria and Irma as opposed to what was experienced by
the rest of the insurance industry in both Puerto Rico and Florida.
Additionally, models developed internally and by third-party vendors are used along with UGI's
subsidiaries historical data in assessing property insurance exposure to catastrophe losses. Losses
and changes in exposure are analyzed and reported to senior leaders regularly. UGI's internal
stress tests focus on predicting business continuity, resiliency, and solvency through a variety of
catastrophe scenarios.
UGI and its subsidiaries measure and monitor insurance risk (which includes claims frequency
and severity and catastrophes and severe weather) with different approaches, including stochastic
methods and scenario analysis.

D. RISK MANAGEMENT

Process for identification of climate related risk
UNICO: Identification of climate change risks is the cornerstone of our underwriting process.
For a very long time, UNICO has been recognized by our reinsurance partners for the reliable
geocoding tools we use to identify property risks in maps, which allows us to monitor
‘accumulation of property values, and risk geography. UNICO also has robust risk inspection
program that helps our personnel understand our book of business and promptly detect any
deviations from our underwriting guidelines. Our understanding of our client’s exposures begins
with our independent sales force which is supported by underwriters and loss control personnel
who provide specific advice in how to protect against all types of exposures including climate
related risks.
UNA: We manage climate change risk as part of the ERM program. Enterprise risks and
opportunities are identified, prioritized, measured, managed, monitored, and reported under an
integrated ERM framework policy, which includes our risk appetite statement, Risk and Return
Principles, key risk and return categories, governance, modeling, analytics, and transparent
management dialogue. The Board’s Risk Committee also annually assesses risk associated with
extremely low frequency scenarios.

Impact of climate related risks on underwriting portfolio
UNICO: Our underwriting guidelines seek risks that are able to withstand hurricane wind forces
and earthquake. Universal crafts its property and casualty portfolio based on climate related
risks, which begins with a process that includes examining construction, location, and type of
risk as well as distance from bodies of water and surrounding geography of the risks. We support
environmental reliance by pricing risks according to construction type. A building constructed
mostly of concrete throughout would pay a much lower premium than a metal building. Our
underwriting guidelines also promote coastal preservation since we do not insure property that is
located less than 1,000 feet from the beach. If as an exception, we underwrite a structure close to
the coast, premiums would be extremely high. Lack of insurance availability and high premiums
discourages building on coastal areas.
UNA: Impacts of climate related risks on the underwriting portfolio to date have been related to
increasing premiums in response to the rising frequency and severity of climate events covered
by UNA products. In addition, higher deductibles have been employed to increase the
policyholders’ contribution to loss dollars needed for covered repairs after such events.
Underwriting requirements also take mitigation features into account when determining
acceptability of risk. Where these measures have not produced adequate results, capacity has
been reduced so that UNA’s risk of loss remains within tolerance.

Steps to encourage policyholders to manage their potential climate related risks
UNICO: Favorable terms and conditions provide incentives for policyholders to protect their
insured assets against climate related exposures such as windstorms and floods. In auto, for
example, certain incentives promote less utilization of insured’s vehicle, ridesharing, and use of
public transportation since it decreases carbon emissions and waste as the probability of an
accident diminishes. We are implementing a usage-based insurance that encourages sensible
pricing based on use, speed, cornering, and other factors. Under this product, an insured receives
a larger discount the less they drive which encourages drivers to think that insurance expense is
part of the overall cost of transportation much like fuel.
UNA: Universal encourages policyholders to manage their potential climate related risks by
charging actuarial supported rates that vary based on the location and physical characteristics of
the property being insured. These rates recognize mitigation efforts and the strength of local
building codes and enforcement thereof. Higher deductibles are offered and often required to
increase the policyholders’ contribution to loss dollars needed for covered repairs after such
events. Underwriting criteria also take mitigation efforts and features into account when
determining acceptability of risk.

How the insurer has considered the impact of climate related risks on its investment

portfolio
UGI on behalf of its subsidiaries has reviewed its internal investments portfolio to assure there is
no exposure to carbon related instruments. This not only reduces environmental risk from an
economic perspective but is also consonant with UGI’s stated and long-running commitment for
a better environment.

viz miuniversalpr.com =
On the investments side, UGI supports environmentally friendly investments by increasing the
allocation into these segment. We do not perceive any risk through the investment in these
securities since they do not affect the economic profile of the portfolio due to its credit ratings
and all other characteristics.
Climate risk is also related to catastrophic events which we have recently experienced with
Hurricanes Irma, Maria, Fiona and Ian. These events did not have an impact on the investment’s
portfolio, since there was no need to liquidate investments due to UGI’s strong re-insurance
program. Still, any unexpected events would create limited investment portfolio exposure, since
all portfolios are created with a ladder type structure, which provides constant cash flow roll-
offs, significantly reducing the need to liquidate investments at any given moment.
UGI maintains a strong liquidity capacity throughout its different affiliates. Available borrowing
sources for UGI includes the use of repo facilities, FHLB Advance programs, credit line facilities
and access to margin. UGI could address any cash need at any time any given day.
What are the financial implications of the process of identifying and assessing climate
related risks
The use of different assumptions and updates to industry models, and updates to our risk transfer
program, could materially change the projected loss. Our growth strategies include areas where
we believe we can enhance diversification and earn an appropriate return for the risk.
As part of the process of identifying and assessing climate related risks, UGI and its subsidiaries
track the frequency and severity of catastrophe related incidents and regularly monitors the
effects that these have over time on claim costs. Specifically, UGI’s Actuarial Department runs
a regular dashboard report that tracks claims and reserve development based on coverage and
business type of activity.
In addition, regular catastrophe modeling and stress testing is performed for each subsidiary and
for UGI as a whole in order to determine the possible financial impacts of different scenarios. In
the case of climate related risks, this modeling and stress testing is performed for UGI’s largest
exposure which is hurricane related disasters or catastrophes. This analysis is also conducted for
claims related to earthquake exposure.
Describe process for managing climate related risks/How climate related risks are
addressed through the insurer’s ERM process and how frequent
The primary function of the UGI Board of Directors is to provide effective leadership and
direction to protect capital and enhance the long-term value of UGI to its shareholders and other
stakeholders. The UGI Board oversees the business affairs of UGI, in collaboration with the
senior executive management for UGI, its affiliates and subsidiaries. The UGI Board has the
overall responsibility for reviewing the strategic plans and performance objectives, financial
plans and annual budget, key operational initiatives, major funding and investment proposals,
financial performance reviews, and corporate governance practices. This also includes
overseeing UGI’s ERM program which is managed at Group and subsidiary level.

The Board has delegated certain functions to various board committees, specifically the Audit
Committee and Investment Committee. The Board accepts that while these board committees
have the authority to examine particular issues and will report back to the Board with their
decisions and/or recommendations, the ultimate responsibility on all matters lies with the Board.
These committees along with the UGI Board as a whole consider climate related risks to the
extent it is necessary to fulfill their responsibilities.

Climate related risks are one of many risks considered within UGI’s ERM process, especially
those risks related to natural catastrophes. In addition, UGI includes other climate related risks
4s part of its emerging risks category and is always on the lookout for these types of risks. This
has become much more evident with UGI’s recent participation in NAIC, CERES, and RIMS
informational meetings in which these topics have been addressed and standards for examining
and reporting have been discussed.

The Executive Leadership Team at UGI and its subsidiaries, under the direction of UGI’s CEO
and the Presidents of each subsidiary have been delegated by the UGI Board with overseeing
UGI’s ERM initiatives. The day-to-day management of ERM activities is overseen by UGI’s
Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer, in consultation with senior executives of each
subsidiary and UGI’s CFO and its Chief Underwriting Officer regularly meet to discuss various
topics related to climate risk, specifically:

a. Ongoing review and understanding of the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures
(TCED) standards for disclosures and corresponding guidance.

b. Ongoing review of the revised NAIC’s Climate Risk Disclosure Survey and the
information required to be disclosed.

c. Identify climate related risks and opportunities that need to be brought to the attention
of UGI’s CEO and its Board.

d. Evaluate and receive input as to metrics that could be used to establish benchmarks to
inform future analysis of climate related risks.

e. UGI’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Underwriting Officer keep UGI’s CEO and
senior management informed on the activities and conclusions of these discussions
and evaluations.

Utilized climate scenarios to analyze their underwriting risk
UNICO: Universal models diverse climate scenarios to analyze underwriting risk. Product
development and risk pricing include expected claims from potential losses from climate related
exposures. Catastrophe modeling has been part of the risk management process that Universal
has followed since its founding. Along with our broking partners, we run simulations on AIR and
RMS to ensure that all possible loss scenarios are covered. These simulations are performed
multiple times a year and are based on our risk data that includes location, construction, geo~
coding, characteristics of the risk, occupancy, and value exposure of the risks in our book of
business. This data is simulated with different natural disaster scenarios to estimate the frequency
and severity of potential losses. The models help us design and implement robust catastrophe
protections program, which includes large buffer protection beyond regulatory requirements as
mandated by our intemal corporate policy. This modeling capability was thoroughly tested for

frequency and severity in real life after hurricanes Maria and Irma directly hit Puerto Rico in
2017.
UNA: Catastrophe models incorporate thousands of actual and possible events applied to the
UNA risk portfolio to simulate loss events for understanding the potential impact to the portfolio.
The models assist in understanding the average annual loss of all such events on a certain risk as
well as groups of risks subject to any given loss. The models also assist UNA in understanding
the impact of the larger and less frequent events that could result in a probable maximum loss
(PML) well exceeding the average in any given year. Analysis of these modeled risk measures
and the features of the properties that have the greatest influence on the average loss and ultimate
PML drive business decisions such as proper risk pricing and acceptability criteria and the level
of reinsurance purchased to protect UNA’s capital.

Measurement of investment risk which is performed on a quarterly basis through cash flow
analysis and shock analysis which measures interest rate risk. Concentration risk has always been
a critical factor embedded within the analysis. All portfolios lack concentration in any particular
region which reduces significantly any exposure to climate risk. Municipals are distributed
throughout the mainland. Florida and Puerto Rico are exposed to frequent climate events such as
hurricanes and have limited portfolio concentration. This applies to all asset segments including
mortgage and corporate instruments. In addition, the portfolio has a significant concentration in
federal instruments and government sponsor agencies which mitigate exposure to climate risk.
The time frame for this evaluation or portfolio analysis is executed up to 3 year horizons
combined with up to 10 year cash flow analysis.
Due to corporate mandates described in our investment policy, UGI maintains a conservative
approach with a high concentration of liquid investment grade fixed income securities.
Additionally, UGI maintains a conservative portfolio duration (currently less than 5 years)
through all affiliates, with a ladder type structure so cash roll-offs are not concentrated on any
given period of time during the next 4- to -5 years.

E. METRICS & TARGETS
UGI and its subsidiaries constantly monitor their risk exposure performing quality reviews and
testing our assumption of risk against the market and our own models. Our exposures are
assessed by using a dashboard that is reviewed by senior managements that measures climate
risk tolerance against the limits of accumulation of property risks and our reinsurance program.
This process allows UGI and its subsidiaries to adapt to the changing conditions of the book of
business on a real-time basis to protect the business against adverse selection of climate risk and
protecting our policyholder surplus. Our underwriting staff is consistently evaluating our risk
profile to ensure strict compliance with management goals.

Catastrophe modeling to manage climate related risks
UGI and its subsidiaries have a conservative risk management approach and base their decisions
‘on actual insurance underwriting, claims, historical experience as well as results from
catastrophe models. Property catastrophic exposure is managed on our property business based
‘on modeled assumptions and currently available industry models. As such, property catastrophe
exposure management includes the purchasing of reinsurance for known exposure such as
hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, and other catastrophes. UNICO’s and UNA’s historical and
inforce data is used to assess the related experience from past weather-related events and to
estimate current expected losses respectively. Loss trends, including those caused by weather
related events and natural disasters, are closely monitored as part of the UGI’s risk management
process. The UNICO’s, PGIC’s and UNA’s key business risks are communicated to and
evaluated by its senior leadership. UGI and its subsidiaries maintain a conservative reinsurance
program and business continuity and disaster recovery plans to mitigate its insurance catastrophe
and operational risks respectively.
UGI’s subsidiaries (UNICO, PGIC and UNA) factor in weather related events experience into
their pricing models and also assess the exposures to the catastrophic perils insured by each
subsidiary using the latest catastrophe models from RMS and AIR. In order for UGI’s
subsidiaries to assess the expected losses from its book of business, it uses catastrophe models to
run analyzes in a monthly basis. Both vendors review and update their models frequently in order
{0 incorporate the latest science, including adjustments for climate change, and data available for
catastrophic perils. The different models are calibrated on a regular basis allowing them to adapt
{0 climate changing patterns. The Company evaluates loss estimates using long-term event rates,
as well as alternative sets of the RMS medium term rates and the AIR warm sea-surface
temperature (WSST) rates. Utilizing both catalogs, in addition to the modeling of storm surge,
allows the Company to capture a comprehensive view of hurricane risk. In addition, the
Company utilizes catastrophic event data and analytics provided by its reinsurance broker and
factors it into the Company's reinsurance strategy.

Metrics to assess and monitor climate related risks
With respect to measuring Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions we are compiling the
information needed to establish the metrics that will be implemented and methodology to be used
in order to be able to compare year to year progress and differences. We are also working with
«an outside consultant to help in this analysis.
Our outside consultant enjoys a long and storied relationship with UGI and its subsidiaries and is
very familiar with UGI’s operations and those of its subsidiaries and affiliates. We worked with
this consultant to develop a Carbon Tool with the purpose of being able to analyze the carbon
exposure that UGI’s underwriting portfolio has. UGI has released positive results from using the
carbon tool developed. The tool helps measure and manage carbon emissions, allowing informed
decisions for reducing environmental impact. UGI accurately measured emissions and identified
areas for improvement. Specific targets were set and strategies implemented to reduce the
company's carbon footprint. Initiatives such as energy efficiency, renewable energy sourcing,
and waste reduction were successful, resulting in cost savings and improved efficiency. The tool
also provided insights into supply chain emissions, enabling collaboration with partners to

implement sustainable practices. Overall, the tool has been instrumental in UGI’s sustainability
efforts, providing accurate data, actionable insights, and a framework for continuous
improvement. UGI’s commitment to measuring and managing carbon emissions demonstrates its
dedication to environmental stewardship. The results obtained from the carbon tool indicate that
UGI’s portfolio is predominantly classified as low risk (99%) with only a small portion
categorized as medium risk (1%) in terms of insured CO2 value. This exceptional outcome can
be attributed to the significant number of residential risks underwritten by UGI, which exhibit
low carbon emissions based on the methodology employed by the tool.
We expect to be able to also implement this tool for UNA in the event that we identify possible
carbon exposure in their underwriting portfolio. Initially, we have been able to determine with
the use of the above-mentioned Carbon Tool that from 2021 to 2022, UNICO was able to
experience a 16% reduction in carbon exposure in its underwriting portfolio. As a result of
continued monitoring and analysis, for year 2023, UNICO has been able to maintain the same
levels of carbon exposure in its underwriting portfolio.
In addition, we continue to examine the California Department of Insurance’s Climate Risk
Analysis report and website to determine next steps and strategies to implement at UGI and its
subsidiaries and affiliates to help in the identification and evaluation of UGI’s and its
subsidiaries exposure to investment in climate pollutants and reduction of greenhouse emissions.
Target to manage climate related risks, opportunities and performance:
UNICO: UGI intends to further align its disclosures with the recommendations of the TCFD by
completing scenario analysis work which is currently being analyzed and evaluated for
implementation. UGI and its subsidiaries continue to develop a financed emissions inventory
and heat map which helps identify the impact of our portfolio on climate change and facilitate
emissions reductions. UGI and its subsidiaries will continue to work toward setting science-
aligned targets and establish an approach to integrating carbon-reduction targets into investments
and operations.
UNA: UNA underwriting uses risk level modeling results to assist in risk selection decisions
based on the ability to price the risk adequately to support the risk’s modeled average annual loss
from catastrophe events as well as its potential impact to the overall probable maximum loss.
This type of analysis considers larger risks and those more exposed to catastrophe based on the
risk location. Outside of these larger risks, modeled loss insights are incorporated into the overall
portfolio pricing and eligibility criteria.

F. CONCLUSION
UGI and its subsidiaries consider all relevant factors that we have identified as being material
and which may affect our business, investment and underwriting processes. These factors
include environmental factors such as climate related risks. After careful evaluation and analysis
UGI, as appropriate, will review and adjust our strategies and practices, as we deem them
appropriate and needed, as the energy market and governmental policies continue to evolve and
mature.

UGI will continue to examine ways to integrate Climate Risks and environmental concerns into
its ERM framework. This is an ongoing process that will experience continued revision and
modification as we continue with UGI’s commitment to understanding the short, medium, and
long-term implications of climate and environmental related trends on its business, its customers
and the communities it does business in. In addition, as a responsible corporate citizen, UGI and
its subsidiaries will continue to seek cost-effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of

Governance
The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of managing climate-
related risks as part of its overall risk management oversight responsibilities.
As part of its risk management framework, UPCIC has procedures in place to identify and assess
new and emerging risks. All identified risks are collectively discussed and analyzed by the
management team, which includes the actuarial, underwriting and claims departments.
Because of UPCIC's business concentration in the state of Florida, it extensively relies on
catastrophe modeling in its risk assessment process. Industry standard catastrophe models are
relied upon to assess risks associated with hurricanes, severe convective storms and other related
weather events, the results of which are inherently impacted by climate change-related risks. These
models are frequently updated to include current trends in weather patterns that reflect the real-
time and predictive effects of climate change by the modeling firms. These assessments include
the process of identifying the severity and likelihood of potential weather events, determining
appropriate financing and reinsurance strategies for potential events, and measuring the potential
impact on the company's financial results.
Strategy
We manage our exposure to climate-related risks through a combination of pricing, underwriting,
and catastrophe modeling along with our reinsurance program, all as part of our overall risk
management program. This includes looking at different climate-related scenarios.
We acknowledge our responsibility to reduce environmental impacts of our business. We are
committed to promoting the benefits of environmental sustainability, reducing our environmental
footprint, encouraging employee involvement, and monitoring progress. In addition, we are focused
on managing our business to ensure environmental laws and recognized standards are met. We
partner with international, national, and local nonprofits and organizations that align with our
company mission, affect our business, and our employees are passionate about.
We are a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Green Power Partner (GPP). Through this
partnership, our goal is to protect human health and the environment by reducing the negative
health impacts of air emissions by using green power. Our organization has committed to use
652,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power annually (25% of our energy through renewals).
Through the purchase of green renewable energy, including wind, solar, low-impact hydroelectric,
and geothermal, we aim to reduce our own carbon footprint while encouraging others to take
similar actions. Our purchase of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) has been certified and verified
by non-profit validation accreditors such as the Center for Resource Solutions’ Green-e program to
meet GPP program requirements.

We are corporate partners with The CLEO Institute, a Florida-based, 501(c)(3) non-profit, non-
partisan organization exclusively dedicated to climate crisis education and advocacy. We are the
primary Corporate Partner for the CLEO Speakers Network, a certification program that builds
individuals’ confidence in climate communication by breaking down the latest science, impacts,
and actionable solutions. Through this training, they can carry a message of urgency to a broader
audience to accelerate climate action. The program has trained hundreds of individuals throughout
Florida to prepare and empower them to become climate advocates in our local communities.
These trained speakers have provided over 1,500 webinars and presentations with vital climate
change information to close to 50,000 Floridians. We are also Silver Level sponsors of the CLEO
Institute's 2022 Climate Symposium, which enlists world-renowned speakers to discuss critical
topics related to the climate crisis and innovative solutions that are available to tackle it. The
‘Symposium brings together close to 1,000 international participants to receive the most up-to-date
data on climate and health-related issues.
We partner with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), the successor to the Pew
Center on Global Climate Change which was founded in 1998, and is widely recognized as an
influential and pragmatic voice on climate issues. Through our partnership, the C2ES resilience
program convenes stakeholders and identifies strategies and policies for all levels of government
that support the climate resilience of communities and businesses in the United States. Our
funding supports C2ES forthcoming reports, which will examine how corporations can help
advance local climate resilience, and how municipalities understand their climate risk to help build
resilience. We were a Bronze Level sponsor of the 2022 C2ES Climate Leadership Conference. The
annual Climate Leadership Conference is North America's premier event dedicated to addressing
the climate crisis through policy, innovation, and business solutions. The conference brings
together over 1,000 forward-thinking leaders from the business (55%), government (20%) and non-
profit/academic (25%) sectors to explore energy and climate solutions and opportunities, and to
showcase climate leadership.
As climate change accelerates and natural disasters strike with more frequency, our involvement as,
a Community Partner with Team Rubicon is vital for affected populations. Team Rubicon is an
organization that mobilizes veterans, leveraging their skills and experience to help people prepare,
respond, and recover from disasters and humanitarian crises. Team Rubicon utilizes the Center for
Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to ensure they reach the most vulnerable and at-
risk communities. The SVI uses census data to measure a community's resiliency when confronted
with an outside stressor. Disasters are indiscriminate, yet their devastating impact continues to.
disproportionally affect the poor and communities of color.
Through our online consumer content resource Clovered SM, we continue to educate consumers
‘on how to prepare, protect, and recover to reduce potential financial losses, save lives, and
preserve property. In addition, Clovered SM has partnered with a number of carriers to provide a
variety of coverages to consumers in predominately coastal states that are most affected by
climate. We believe this service and protection we provide to those hardest impacted by climate-
related natural disasters is one of the strongest actions we can take to support the livelihood of
consumers and is paramount to the sustainability and resilience of our towns and cities as well as
environmental management and climate strategy.

Sustainability Efforts:
To reduce our paper consumption and more efficiently deliver services to our customers, we
revitalized our digital presence to enable our customers to submit claims and view documents
electronically through our newly revamped public-facing websites.
We have continued our concerted effort to transition close to one million U.S. policyholders to ""go
paperless.” The goal of this ongoing initiative is to capture all policyholders electronically, while
reducing our dependency on paper correspondence.
In 2020, we installed Elkay water fountain filtration systems in several of our buildings. Adding the
filtration systems has reduced our dependency on purchasing water bottles for employees and will
result in a long-term cost savings for the Company. Each filtration station informs users of the
number of 20 oz. single-use water bottles saved from waste by using reusable bottles and cups. By
incorporating these fountains, we ultimately plan on reducing our plastic bottle consumption by
200,000 bottles per year.
Modifications for Energy Efficiency:
We are committed to enhancing energy efficiency and have therefore implemented significant
upgrades in our facilities. Exterior windows now feature low-e tinted glass, maximizing natural light
while minimizing heat gain. The roof gravel at our headquarters was replaced with white reflective
TPO membrane over R-20 insulation, serving to reflect sunlight and minimize cooling needs for the
building. We have doubled the required R-5 exterior wall insulation to R-10 batts, further insulating
our building. Our air conditioning system in our primary facility has been upgraded to an air-cooled
chilled water system, offering greater efficiency. We have begun our next steps in taking stories in
energy efficiency with transitioning to energy-efficient LED lighting in our facilities. The existing
initiatives are pivotal in our journey towards improving our energy efficiency.
Risk Management
UPCIC's risk management framework involves identifying particular events or circumstances (risk
and opportunities) relevant to its objectives, assessing risks in terms of the likelihood and
magnitude of impact, determining a response strategy in the event of a risk event, and continuously
monitoring its exposure to key risks.
UPCIC regards climate change as a factor impacting risk associated with extreme weather events in
that itis linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse
gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain and snow. The actuarial, underwriting and
claims departments continuously monitor and model all risks for the perils insured under its
policies, which include insured losses from weather events.
UPCIC’s investment decisions are based on research performed by its professional investment
advisors who are required to adhere to the company's investment guidelines. Any investments that
either promote climate change initiatives or are impacted by climate change would be subject to
research and scrutiny by the company's investment advisors to assure the investment meets its
investment guidelines, requires action when an investment no longer meets those guidelines and
3

that UPCIC's overall investment portfolio promotes the company’s financial strength. UPCIC has
not adopted specific guidelines regarding the climate change sector.
Metrics and Targets
The company uses various statistics and measures including return times, average annual loss, etc.
related to the impact of weather risks that are influenced by climate change.

scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
Response to Strategy
The University of Michigan Health Plan currently does not have a stated plan focused on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions produced by its business operations. We monitor, review, and evaluate the impact of climate change on our
business operations and on our members/customers as part of our overall DR-BCP.
We allow teleworking, and most of our associates work remotely or in a hybrid arrangement. This change in the
business model allowed us to shrink our physical footprint by 75%.

UPHP Response for Governance:
The Upper Peninsula Health Plan (UPHP) is a Michigan health maintenance organization. UPHP provides health
coverage to individuals enrolled in Medicare or in the Michigan Medicaid program. UPHP does not provide
insurance coverage for property or casualty loss.
Any climate-related disclosure or decision-making would be made at the company level, and not at a group level.
Given the focus of UPHP’s work, UPHP has not issued publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and
opportunities.
UPHP has an active Environmental Stewardship Committee made up of its employees. The ES Committee is
endorsed and supported by the UPHP Senior Management Team. The ES Committee was formed in August 2022
to support UPHP’s commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainability by promoting eco-friendly
practices and initiatives within the company. Since formation, the ES Committee:
‘Replaced disposable office kitchen supplies with reusable items;
© Started an on-site battery recycling program which has already led to collection of over 150 pounds of
batteries;
© Started an on-site paper and plastics recycling program;
* Placed reusable paper towels and stainless-steel K-cups at each coffee station in the office building;
* Arranged for employees to clean different parts of the community on company time;
* Initiated a company-wide plastic recycling challenge with an unrelated third party; and
* Provided each employee with their own set of reusable cutlery.
The ES Committee also provides employee education on sustainable practices.

In addition, UPHP’s corporate office building, which was constructed in 2016, was constructed with or later
supplemented with the following climate-minded features:
‘© Water bottle refill stations on each of the three floors of the building, which has led to savings of over
400,000 plastic water bottles;
© Automatic adjustment of thermostats after 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and during weekends to reduce heating
costs during winter months and cooling costs in summer months;
‘© Lighting systems that turn off after no motion is detected over a certain period of time;
‘© Natural gas heat; and
© LED lighting throughout the building.
UPHP also invested in a community solar panel garden to generate renewable energy.
UPHP’s Facility Coordinator participated in energy efficiency education offered by the Midwest Energy Efficiency
Alliance and continues to search for ways to keep the corporate office building energy efficient.
UPHP utilizes a janitorial service that uses environmentally friendly cleaning products whenever possible. UPHP
also provides staff with compostable, wooden cutlery at coffee stations and in the breakroom, instead of single-use
plasticware.
UPHP addresses risks in an annual risk assessment exercise. This exercise is led by the UPHP Compliance
Department and requires each department within the company to identify risks to the company so those risks can
be mitigated to the extent practicable. While climate-related financial risks have not been identified as a company
risk to date, climate-related financial risks would be assessed and managed by the UPHP Chief Financial Officer.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
UPHP Response for Strategy:
UPHP has not identified actual or potential impacts of climate-related risks to its strategy or financial planning,
UPHP has identified that a climate-related natural disaster or fire could potentially impact its corporate office
building.
UPHP has identified opportunities to assess, reduce, or mitigate greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise
stem from its operations. For example, UPHP allows most of its employees to work from their homes on at least a
hybrid basis. Some employees exclusively work from their homes, while others split their time between the office
setting and their home.
UPHP also utilizes initiatives developed by its Environmental Sustainability Committee (ES Committee) to mitigate
the company’s impact on the environment, and uses ideas procured by its Facility Coordinator improve building
efficiencies.
In addition, in considering the health benefits provided by UPHP to its Medicare and Medicaid enrollees, UPHP
covers a wide range of telemedicine services which allow enrollees to receive medical care without the need for
travel. In many cases UPHP also covers mail order pharmaceutical products which further reduces an enrollee’s
need for travel.
For enrollees who must travel to obtain benefits, UPHP provides them with transportation assistance, including via
public transportation.
While UPHP is happy to have identified and acted upon these opportunities in the short term, UPHP has not set
medium or long-term goals or strategies related to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
UPHP understands that climate risks may impact the health of our Medicare and Medicaid enrollees and may
impact medical costs in a variety of ways. UPHP actively assists enrollees in identifying and locating non-medical
resources, as needed by the enrollee, such as heating, housing and food assistance.

UPHP Response for Risk Management:
UPHP identifies potential company risks, including climate-related risks, during its annual risk assessment exercise.
This exercise involves all departments within the company and requires each department to identify actual or
perceived risks to their specific department. All risks are compiled into one large assessment and then categorized
and scored both by likelihood level (unlikely, likely, or very likely to occur) and magnitude of impact (high, medium,
or low impact). Items identified as high risk are then incorporated into UPHP’s annual Auditing and Monitoring
Work Plan. The risk assessment is shared with the UPHP Management Committee (.e., board of directors) each
year.
The risk assessment exercise is how UPHP would identify, assess and manage climate-related risks. The current
risk assessment includes “Natural Disaster: Earthquake, Extreme Heat, Flood, Fire, Power Outage, Tornado” and
separately “Winter Weather (Snowstorms/Blizzards)” as potential risks to the corporate office building and ongoing
business operations. Using the categorization and scoring method described above, these were not ultimately
identified as a high risk by UPHP and thus were not included in the Auditing and Monitoring Work Plan.
UPHP maintains both a Business Continuity Plan and an Emergency Operations Plan. These Plans collectively
ensure that UPHP is able to respond accordingly and continue its operations during emergency situations,
including climate-related emergencies.
UPHP does not set premiums for the health benefits it administers, and thus does not perform underwriting.
UPHP’s investment policy focuses on low risk, highly rated fixed income securities. UPHP has not historically
considered climate scenarios when analyzing or choosing investments or risks to its investments.

C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
UPHP Response for Metrics and Targets:
Assessment of climate-related risks occurs during UPHP’s annual risk assessment exercise, in which all risks
(climate and otherwise) are reviewed and considered.
During this risk assessment, UPHP considers the likelihood of occurrence and the magnitude of impact if it does
occur. In terms of likelihood, each identified risk is categorized as unlikely to occur, likely to occur, or very likely to
occur. The risk is then further categorized by the impact the risk, if realized, will have on UPHP operations. The
impact choices are low, medium, or high. A risk with high impact, for example, would be something that may
result in loss of major assets or resources; may significantly harm the company’s mission or interest; or may result
in human death or injury. A risk that is unlikely to occur is one in which there is little potential for this risk to occur

THIS REPORT OUTLINES THE PRIMARY FACETS OF HOW UTICA FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY
(NAIC #15326) DEALS WITH ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE COMPANY.
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL CONCERN IMPACTING ALL FACETS OF SOCIETY. WITH
INSURANCE BEING ANECESSARY TOOL TO ASSIST WHEN LOSSES OCCUR, THE INCREASING
IMPACT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE HAS ON THE WORLD IS OF UNDENIABLE IMPORTANCE TO
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, AND UTICA FIRST INSURANCE BEARS THIS EXPOSURE ALONG
WITH ALL OTHER INSURERS.
AS CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO POSE NEW AND INFLATED RISKS TO THE INDUSTRY
AND UTICA FIRST SPECIFICALLY, OUR MENTALITY AND STRATEGY TO ADAPT FOR IT MUST
CHANGE AND BE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED. RISK APPETITE AND SELECTION,
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, LIQUIDITY POSITION, AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT ARE OF
PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO US.
UTICA FIRST HAS IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE RISK
TO THE CORPORATION:
INSURANCE/UNDERWRITING RISK - This is the risk that climate change poses to our risk
selection. There is no denying that rising sea surface temperatures (SST) have impacted
weather patterns resulting in more frequent and severe storms in the last decade. Additionally
rising sea levels poses significant risk to the corporation's risk portfolio.
LIQUIDITY/INVESTMENT RISK — Utica First must be sure its investment portfolio has
accounted for ongoing climate change and that's its specific investments bear as little impact
to climate change as possible. This means the company will focus its investment portfolio on
instruments that are sheltered from the impacts of climate change and its stock portfolio is
made up of investments in corporations that have already or are in the process of adjusting for
the impact of climate change. This investment strategy and its conservative nature should
result in the company having a liquidity position that amply supports the risk it has assumed
in its policy writings.
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT RISK - This is risk that is presented when state or federal
regulations impact the company, and the insurance contracts it has written. Regulations which
are enacted after climate related events such as moratoriums on cancellations and non-
renewals, forgiveness of premiums, and inability to enact contract terms such as windstorm
deductibles all place a significant burden on the company. Monitoring these actions and
predicting on a go forward basis will help the company select risks and exposures that the
company can manage and control and will not place it or its policyholder owners in a financially
tenuous position.

TOPIC PROGRESS
UTICA FIRSTS SHORT TERM: Short term is defined by the corporation as 12 - 18 months. For this timeframe Utica First continues to
IDENTIFIED monitor its concentration and aggregation of climate exposed risks, with a particular focus on those near a coastline. Utica
CLIMATE First takes strategic action to monitor and amend premium charges that adequately reflect the exposures risks of this
RELATED nature present. Utica First is also taking action to control and/or reduce its risk base in Catastrophe prone areas such as
RISKS BY those exposed to increased threat of hurricane/windstorm, tornado, hail, and rising sea levels.
TIMEFRAME . . ve th + st is monitoring i
MID TERM: Mid-term is defined by the corporation as 18 - 60 months. For this timeframe Utica First is monitoring its
portfolio of available insurance product offerings with the intent of determining if catastrophe exposed products such as its
Homeowners products should continue to be offered, and if so, what product changes need to be made to continue offering
these products. Utica First will also review its sales channels to determine if its sales partners in areas that are prone to
the impact of climate change need to be reduced or changed.
LONG TERM: Long term is defined by the corporation as 60 months and beyond. For this timeframe Utica First will
monitor the impact climate change will have on its products and profitability, and it will review potential changes to its
geographic footprint. It will analyze whether it should offer different products and whether it should offer its products in new
states or geographic regions to help minimize and control the impact climate change will have on the corporation.
CLIMATE BUSINESS: Utica First is cognizant of the impact that climate change will have on its core book of business. As exposure
RELATED RISK __ increases, premiums and coverage must be adjusted to adequately compensate for the increased exposures and the
IMPACT TO increased cost of reinsurance. Furthermore, Utica First is aware that industry trends and competitive forces presented
UTICA FIRST when others react to climate change will impact our ongoing operations. Competitors and partners entering or exiting the
FROM VARYING _ industry will all have impacts on our core books of business. We have recently become aware of several competitors who
PERSPECTIVES _ are exiting from specific lines of business or specific states because of their inability to purchase Cat reinsurance or to
derive necessary profitability margins, and therefore these types of exposures will need to be monitored with necessary
action being prioritized as an urgent business need as necessary.
STRATEGY: Utica First will continue to make climate change a key determinant in its strategic planning and decision
making. Utica First uses technology including analytics, AV/ML, and risk modeling tools/algorithms for risk selection and
pricing strategies. Utica First prescribes to the notion that sharing the increasing costs that climate change poses to the
company with those policyholders who choose to live in Cat prone areas and climate change heavily impacted locations
represent Best practices and furthermore best protects the diverse policyholder owners of the company.
NAIC #15326

UTICA FIRST
FINANCIAL PLANNING: Utica First partners with its Cat reinsurers from a technology perspective to generate location
specific cat exposure premiums based on average annual loss measurements for each location, and it will pass portions
of those premiums, where permissible, on to the policyholder to ensure the financial stability of the company. As
reinsurers and risk modelers, such as AIR and RMS, catastrophe modeling technology improves, their ability to
accurately predict the impact and future costs of climate change on the company's specific book of business improves
tremendously. An API which provides location specific pricing is the best strategic option available to the company at the
current time and for the near and midterm foreseeable timeframes.
ANTICIPATED Utica First analyzes the potential impact of climate-related changes as part of our strategic planning process as well as
RISKS AND during our annual Catastrophe Reinsurance planning process. Our strategy has been to either maintain or decrease
RESILIENCY OF market share in both commercial and personal property and casualty business for risks in geographic areas prone to
UTICA FIRSTS __ increased severe weather patterns. After experiencing several catastrophe losses from 2017 - 2020, Utica First has
CLIMATE repositioned its book of homeowner's business by reducing writings in areas near the CT, NJ and NY coastlines and has
RELATED RISK __ placed varying new business moratoriums on risks within certain distances to the coastline.
STRATEGIES om . , i
Additionally, by partnering with our reinsurance partners and their Catastrophe Modeling and Analytics Teams and Pricing
Groups, we monitor climate change information as part of their analysis of weather-related trends. Models developed by
third-party vendors such as AIR and RMS are used along with our historical data in assessing property insurance exposure
to all types of catastrophe losses including severe convective storms, ice/snow, wind, etc. Losses and changes in exposure
are analyzed and reported to our leadership team. Our BCAR (Best Capital Adequacy Ratio) stress testing focuses on
predicting business continuity, resiliency, and solvency through a variety of catastrophe scenarios.
Over the past 12 months these efforts have led to a 15.1% reduction in Total Insured Value in our homeowners’ lines of
business. Our continuing efforts are to write more business that has a controllable and measurable exposure to climate
change and to cap and adequately reinsure all our business, including those policies that are more prone to the impacts
of climate change.
Our investment committee will continue to monitor the catastrophe exposure of real estate investments and portfolios.
In summary, Utica First measures and monitors insurance risk (which includes claims frequency and claims severity to
catastrophe and severe weather events) with different approaches, including stochastic modeling and scenario analysis
in conjunction with the assistance of our reinsurance partners and their modeling tools.

Company Response to Question #1.
The Company Response to individual Survey questions can be applicable to more than one Survey
question(s), and as such, the response to each Survey question is hereby incorporated by reference into the
response to each survey question, as applicable. The Company is fully Compliant with the NYS DFS Climate
Change Risk Guidance requirements needed as of 8/26/24. Please note that the responses to this Question
are based on the TCFD guidance and the Appendix to New York’s memorandum dated July 7, 2022. As to
publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and opportunities, a summary of the response to the Climate
Survey is posted on our public facing website.
The disclosure is being made by Utica Mutual Insurance Company (a member company of the Utica
National Insurance Group) the level at which (1) the Group’s risk appetite is determined; (2) the Group’s
earnings, capital, liquidity, operations and reputation are overseen collectively and at which the
supervision of these factors is coordinated and exercised; and (3) legal responsibility for general corporate
governance duties, including climate change risk, is placed. All climate related activities are undertaken by
Utica Mutual (all employees of the Group are either Utica Mutual or Founders Insurance Company
employees) on behalf of all group companies.

Company Response to 1A and 1B:

1. Senior management and Board Committee responsible for the insurer's management of climate risks:
The Company hasa multipronged approach regarding the Board’s oversight of Climate Related Risk and
Opportunities. The Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee (EROC) of the Board of Directors has been
designated responsible for the Company’s management of climate risk. The Chief Risk Officer hasbeen
designated as member of Senior Management responsible for the insurer’s management of Climate
Risk. In addition, the Company has a cross functional committee to be responsible for the various
elements relating to the management of climate change risk (Emerging & Climate Risk Committee or
ECR), made up of C-Suite members (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Underwriting
Officer, Chief Actuary, Chief Sales Officers, by segments, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Claims Officer,
and Chief Product, Pricing and Performance Officer), as well as additional members of their teams to
supplement the operation of the Committee (e.g., data rich resources to ensure the committee has the
information necessary to be effective).

2. Organizational Structure - defined/articulated roles, responsibility & accountability for risk-based
decision making in setting climate risk limits & implementation: The roles and responsibilities of each
member of the ECR Committee are clearly defined in the Committee Charter and tracked by a Charter
Scorecard. Executive Leadership considers and approves corporate goals and strategies that consider
the impact of Climate Risk relating to business strategies and growth opportunities impacted by climate
exposure, including coastal aggregation, correlation and business mix (as examples), as part of overall
decision-making process which determines the corporate strategy, both short and long term. The Chief
Risk Officer and the ECR are required to report to EROC. EROC’s charter requires that this Board level
committee review the Company's risk exposure relating, but not limited to Climate Risk. The EROC
approves the Company’s risk tolerances and the Company’s compliance therewith, reviews the
Company's ORSA, receives reports and Director Education regarding Climate Risk, weather, and
nonweather-related exposures; CAT modeling and return period loss estimates, etc. EROC meets
quarterly and the CRO reports to EROC each quarter; the ECR Committee must report to EROC at least
once annually or as needed.

As noted in response to Questions 2 and 3, the Investment Advisory Committee, a subcommittee of the

Board’s Finance Committee, has responsibility for reviewing any investments in sectors deemed vulnerable

to risks based on climate change.

3. Explicit consideration of climate risks in risk management processes, in enterprise risk reports and
ORSA Summary Reports: See responses to #1 # 2 above. In addition: Climate Risk is considered and
modeled in the Company's ORSA Summary Report, along with the impact of various climate (and non-
climate related impact) including NAT CAT & Severe Convective Storm, as examples.

4, Objective, independent & regular reviews of functions & procedures for managing climate risks, report
the findings of the reviews to the Board: Internal Audit is charged with ensuring the Company is in
compliance with the Climate Risk Guidance and the Emerging & Climate Risk Committee's Charter &

Scorecard. The Compliance Department (in Corporate Legal) ensures compliance with the climate
related disclosure requirements such as the Climate Risk Survey.

5. Consideration of implementing remuneration policies to align incentives with strategy for managing
climate risks & performance against climate risk metrics: The Emerging & Climate Risk Committee
discussed and considered options for remuneration policies, including the potential of using a bonus
program as a means for aligning the management of climate change risk and performance against
applicable metrics. During the next annual cycle, Executive Leadership, Human Resources & the
Personnel, Compensation & Benefits Committee (of the Board of Directors) will consider including
climate risk management in the creation of goals for leadership.

6. Manage Climate Risks through Existing ERM Functions: assessment, compliance internal control,
internal audit and actuarial functions. See response to items #1-7 noted above.

7. Board & Senior Management Support - development of skill, expertise, knowledge required for
assessment & management of climate risks by new hires, all current employees & the Board of Directors.
The Company has arranged for and conducted numerous director education presentations to the Board
of Directors, the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee as well as the Emerging & Climate Risk Committee.
In addition, the Company required the viewing of a 30+ minute Climate Risk video for each employee and
Board Member in 2023.

Company Response to Question #2:
The Company Response to individual Survey questions can be applicable to more than one Survey
question(s), and as such, the response to each Survey question is hereby incorporated by reference into the
response to each survey question, as applicable.
Climate risk poses various risks to the Company, including: underwriting risk, financial risk, liquidity risk,
credit risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and human capital risk. These risks could affect the Company
in various ways and to varying degrees, depending on the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events that occur where the Company's insurance, as well as its operations and workforce, are exposed.
We rely upon our data as well as those of our reinsurance and investment partners to help us understand
the changes we continue to see.
With respect to engaging with key constituencies, to gain a better understanding of current and future
weather patterns and climate change we have met with reinsurers, our reinsurance broker and their
meteorologists & climatologists, reviewed CAT modelsand Climate Risk models, sponsored Board of Director
and Senior Leader education sessions, met with investment advisors, met with NYS DFS, attended
conferences on Climate, and held a joint session with a college student risk management group to discuss
climate risk.
The Company has taken steps to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions. These include some of the
projects to mitigate emissions over the past few years:
* Decommissioned a 50 year old back up boiler (removal completed)
© Replaced a 20 plus year old AC unit at our main entrance with an energy efficient Mitsubishi split
system that is controlled by the Building Automation System versus manually
* Implementation of all new 2 floor (85,000sqft space) LED lighting, timers and sensors
* All new furniture and carpet is all or partial recycled materials (85,000 sqft space remodeled)
* Shut down all non-essential kitchen equipment and compressors
* Eliminated multiple printers as a result of our hybrid environment Eliminating printers means
elimination of several toner cartridges and reduced paper usage
* Reduce or shut down HVAC to vacant floors in a large portion of the home office building
* Reduce the number of restrooms in use - saves on supplies
* Replacing the final 4 smaller atrium roofs and increasing the insulation value from R-9 to R-31
* Reduced our leased footprint in 5 regional offices by almost 31,000 sq ft

* Continue to pursue grants and energy star programs

The Company continues to assess, reduce or mitigate its carbon footprint and is considering the following
future initiatives:

* Rooftop solar/photovoltaic “farm”

© Geothermal assessments using our parking lot area

* Purchase more or all of our energy from renewable service providers

* Lease from property owners who are low or zero emission buildings

Company Response to Question #2A:

With respect to short, medium and long-term risks:

* Short-Term (through 2025): The Company will continue to run probabilistic hurricane models with
current climate influences (e.g., warmer sea surface temperatures) and the AIR Warm Sea Surface
Temperature Catalogue Impact to measure annual aggregate loss change estimates and stress tests
at the 1 in 100 return period, as well as further out on the tail. The Company continues to lever age
the model's secondary perils such as storm surge and demand surge across our modeling to ensure
non-climate factors of increased loss potential are also contemplated. With careful underwriting, we
provide flood coverage to commercial policyholders, as appropriate and consistent with our
underwriting guidelines. To complement our probabilistic modeling, various severity stress tests of
Long Island Hurricane exposure, sea level rise, temperature and ambient temperature are being
tracked and analyzed. We continue to review our weather peril guidance as well as continuing to
invest in newtechnologiesto help usbetter establish our guidelines. Asan example, we haverecently
updated our Flood Guidelines based on a new flood score we receive from a vendor partner. This
takes into consideration the distance to flood zone, the elevation, and the estimated height of the
flood waters.

*  Medium-Term (through 2030s): See above, plus develop a more refined assessment of the
Company's portfolio that is susceptible to increasing trends (e.g., severe tornados & large hail), with
an expectation that the trend will continue for the next 10-20 years. This analysis will help identify
pockets of exposure that may currently, or historically have been seen as lower risk to thunderstorm,
which may shift to increasing propensity for severe tornado or hail outcomes in the future.

‘* Long-Term (2040 & beyond): See above, plusdetermine which coastal insuredsare at risk of becoming
a stranded asset due to sea level rise.

Company Response to Question #28:

Turning to business, strategy and financial planning, and helping customers adapt to climate-related risk,
the Company Response to individual Survey questions can be applicable to more than one Survey
question(s), and as such, the response to each Survey question is hereby incorporated by reference into
the response to each Survey question, as applicable. In both our Commercial and Personal Lines offerings
we have adopted the ISO Green Coverage Endorsements. These help to cover any increased costs if the
insured has “environmentally friendly” equipment or substitute such equipment duringa claim. We will
continue to research and monitor for opportunities to develop or implement any new products that will
help our policyholders adapt to climate-related risk.

In addition to the building and policyholder-related investments described above, the Company has
incorporated climate considerations into its investment strategy. The Company engages with asset
managersto understand how climate risksare considered in their overall credit review process. Exposure
to sectors deemed vulnerable to risks from climate change is monitored and asset managers report on
individual issuers and holdings that that they consider at risk. Analysis is done to assess the impact of
credit rating changes in our portfolio on surplus. An Investment Advisory Committee Charter scorecard
item was added for an annual review of securities deemed vulnerable to risks based on climate change.
We engaged our investment consultant to perform an annual ESG/dlimate risk review and scoring of our
portfolios versus benchmarks using MSC! ESG data. In addition to MSC! scoring data, our primary asset
manager utilizes a proprietary ESG rating system. And our quarterly review of other than temporarily
impaired assets (“OTTI”) process was enhanced to include a focus on sectors deemed vulnerable to risks
based on climate change. Unrelated to monitoring the impact climate risk has on the credit quality of the
investment portfolio, a 1% target allocation to “green” bonds has been made part of the Investment
Policy Statement and Guidelines.
Company Response to Question #2C:
Concerning the resilience of the Company's strategy, taking into account different climate-related
scenarios, the time frames relative to 2 degree C of warming are most applicable for our long-term
scenarios due the expected gradual impact over time. The sea level rise analysis for the Company
contemplatesa view every 20 years out to 2100, and as a result captures scenarios both below and
above 2 degrees C of warming.

Company Response to Question #3:
The Company Response to individual Survey questions can be applicable to more than one Survey
question(s), and as such, the response to each Survey question is hereby incorporated by reference into the
response to each survey question, as applicable.
With respect to underwriting risk, corporately, we strive to keep a geographic spread of business to avoid
exposure beyond our appetite to a storm or other climate changes in one area. We continue to monitor
risks with coastal exposure to hurricane surge/wind via our coastal proximity guidelines. We also monitor
our aggregation as far as tornado/wind exposure inland on individual risks as they are submitted, as well as
from a corporate level. We have grown substantially away from the coast to diversify the underwriting
portfolio. We consistently review our results from a geographic standpoint to understand if there are any
changes related to weather/climate exposures. We have limited transition risk in our underwriting
portfolio given the markets that we write. We will continue to assess any liability risks.
With respect to assisting policyholders, the Company prepares loss control surveys that it provides to
insureds to address identified risk exposures. The Company also offers technical loss control support to
policyholders on weather-related exposures.
Our investment management function is supported by multiple industry advisors. Our primary asset
manager utilizes a proprietary ESG rating system for corporate and municipal issues. Exposure in the
portfolio to the energy and metals and mining sectorsis reported monthly. Our quarterly OTTI process has
been enhanced to include a focus on sectors deemed vulnerable to risk based on climate change and to
determine if there is concern with individual issuers. As part of that review, our primary asset manager
providesa transition risk assessment for each industry, indicating the degree of preparedness to transition
towards a lower carbon economy and assigns a ticker-level transition risk factor to identify companies at
risk for non-alignment. These factors also feed into their overall ESG rating system for corporate and
municipal issues. Monthly, asset managers report on individual holdings they consider to be at risk, or
which have been placed on close watch. Our investment consultant performs an annual ESG/climate risk
review and scoring of our portfolios versus benchmarks using MSC! ESG data; MSC! ratings do not cover
municipals, High Yield Bank Loans, non-Agency asset backed securities, or private securities. We have
utilized the 2DIl PACTA tool as an additional way of viewing our portfolio’s alignment with various climate
scenarios. Annually, we assess the impact to RBC from a sweeping downgrade of credit ratings across the
portfolio (a one-notch drop across the entire fixed income portfolio). We maintain a 1% target allocation to.
“green” bonds, which has been made part of the Investment Policy Statement and Guidelines.

Company Response to Question #3A:
With respect to the process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, the Company Response to
individual Survey questions can be applicable to more than one Survey question(s), and as such, the
response to each Survey question is hereby incorporated by reference into the response to each survey
question, as applicable. See also the responses to Question 1. Based on historical and modeling data along
with our property reinsurance placement, the Company has developed exposure aggregation restrictions in
high-risk areas. The Company incorporates the weather exposure and corresponding reinsurance charges in
our property pricing.
Company Response to Question #3B:
With respect to managing risk, please see above and below responses, which are incorporated herein.
Additionally, the Company uses deterministic models with various scenarios including CAT & Non-CAT, (e.g,
CAT 1-100, 1-250 and beyond, Climate Risk, Cyber, Pandemic, Epidemic, inflation, severe convective storm,
reverse stress tests/tail events, etc.) and stochastic models. The Company manages risk with mitigation
strategies informed by modeled results. The Company’s robust reinsurance programs ensure adequate
transfer of risk and are analyzed each year based on exposure changes.
Company Response to Question #3C:
With respect to the first two bullet points under question 3, the Company Response to individual Survey
questions can be applicable to more than one Survey question(s), and as such, the response to each Survey
question is hereby incorporated by reference into the response to each survey question, as applicable. See
response to Questions 1(A), 2(A), 3(B), 4, 4(A). With respect to the third bullet point please refer to the
portion of the response to Question 3 addressing investments.
METRICS AND TARGETS
4, Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your business.
Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to assess, if any.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:
+ In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate
scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount
of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related
risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.

* Asterisks represent questions derived from the original Climate Risk Disclosure Survey.

Company Response to Question #4 and 4A:

The Company Response to individual Survey questions can be applicable to more than one Survey
question(s), and as such, the response to each Survey question is hereby incorporated by reference into the
responseto each survey question, as applicable. The Company usescatastrophe modeling to analyze Natural
Catastrophe losses as well as specific impacts to various gates around the country, which could impact our
underwriting portfolio. The return period estimates in the 1 in 100 and 1 in 250 inform our mitigation
strategies, including our reinsurance purchase. The Company sets and monitors targets for impact to surplus
at risk tolerance limits. The CAT reinsurance protection purchased by the Company annually maintains
compliance with our stated risk tolerance limits. Those limits are approved by the Enterprise Risk Oversight
Committee of the Board of Directors annually.

The Company reviews exposure accumulations by distance to coast bands every three months with regional
leadership and then identifies any new business written by inception date in these areas of concern to ensure
that sufficient underwriting was maintained. Utica Mutual utilizes catastrophe modelsto annually determine
how much catastrophe reinsurance coverage to purchase based on the 1:100 and 1:250 return period
estimates.

Company Response to Question #48:

With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, the Company has not calculated our GHG emissions and we are
not aware of a rule that would require a mutual insurance company to do so.

Company Response to Question #4C:

With respect to targets, the surplus impact targets are absolute, annual and the base year is current year
and the KPI is the compliance with the stated target. The placement of the Company's property
catastrophe reinsurance coverage is based on risk tolerance metrics which are a function of the surplus
position at year-end, are absolute, and are applied annually to the Company’s risk modeled exposure
across the portfolio.

CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURESURVEY

VOYA Filed Date: August 30, 2024
toward protecting the environment. The ECS can be found at https://www.voya.com/page/statements-
and-policies.
‘As outlined in the ECS, Voya fosters environmentally responsible behavior by encouraging the embedding
of sustainable practices across the enterprise, managing, measuring, and reporting on our performance,
raising awareness among employees, and highlighting success stories. Voya continually works to improve
the systems that monitor our environmental performance and is committed to internal and external
stakeholder engagement regarding our environmental impacts (see the “Strategy” section of this survey
for additional information regarding stakeholder engagement)
Since 2015, Voya has been a member of RE100, a global initiative of leading companies committed to
sourcing 100% of their electricity from renewable energy sources. This pledge aims to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions and promote environmentally responsible business practices. Additionally, we have
been annually disclosing our environmental sustainability performance to CDP (formerly known as the
Carbon Disclosure Project), a global disclosure system that allows companies, cities, states, and regions to
share their environmental impacts with investors, asset owners, and other stakeholders.
Voya Financial became a signatory supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(“CFD”) recommendations in 2018. Since 2008, we have also been a member of the Environmental
Protection Agency Green Power Partnership, a voluntary program that encourages organizations to use
green power to reduce their environmental impacts. In 2022, Voya joined the United Nations Global
Compact (UNGC), a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation, and disclosure
of responsible business practices. Additional information about Voya’s engagement on environmental,
social, and governance (“ESG”) matters can be found throughout these survey responses and in Voya
Financial’s most recent Impact Report (https://www.voya.com/page/esg-environmental-social-and-
governance-reporting).
The board of directors of Voya Financial (the “Voya Board”) is responsible for the oversight of the
management of ESG matters of significance to Voya.
""At the Voya Board level:

+ The Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee of the Voya Board assists the
Voya Board in overseeing and reviewing information regarding ESG matters of significance to
Voya, including, without limitation, significant policies, procedures and practices.

= Atthe Insurance Company board level:

+ Each Insurance Company's board has a designated Climate Risk Officer who is responsible for
assisting the Insurance Company's board and management in meeting the Insurance Company's
duties to manage climate risk.

Climate-related risks are identified, assessed, and managed in alignment with Voya’s broader ERM
framework. This framework requires the regular identification of current and emerging threats and risks,
conducting risk and business impact assessments, and implementing mitigation measures when risk levels
are deemed unacceptable. These activities are overseen by the Voya Management Risk Committee. To
further advance Voya’s ESG (including climate-related) strategy and better integrate and manage identified
priorities, in 2023 Voya established a new ESG governance structure, which includes a cross-functional ESG
Steering Committee that oversees multiple workstreams. The ESG Steering Committee, which reports to
the Voya CEO, oversees the overall ESG strategy, execution, and reporting.
Voya’s ESG risk management framework is comprehensive, encompassing a broad spectrum of Voya's
activities. This includes managing relationships with business partners and communities, reflecting our
commitment to responsible business conduct that is socially, environmentally, economically, and ethically
sound, resonating with our corporate values. We regularly review our ESG risk management approach,
along with the associated processes, to manage inherent risks. Climate-related risks are generally managed
in conjunction with the broader risk assessment process as further addressed in the “Risk Management”
section.

2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the
insurer's businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
Consider including the following
* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate
risk and resiliency.
* Describe the insurer’s plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its
operations or organizations.
A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
medium, and long term.
Consider including the following
* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-Syears as short term, 5-10years as
medium term, and 10-30years as long term.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business,
strategy, and financial planning.
Consider including the following
* Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low
carbon economy or help customers adapt to climate-related risk.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-
related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

Risks associated with climate change, some of which are described further below, also provide

opportunities to engage with key constituencies to explore ways in which we can address climate change

through actionable environmental stewardship initiatives as well as through customer solutions that
promote a more responsible future. Our engagement efforts include:

+ Employees: Our employee-led Environmental Stewardship Council promotes positive behaviors both
in our offices and at the homes and in the communities where our employees live and work, and
empowers employees to play a role in helping to define and follow through on Voya’s environmental
efforts.

+ Suppliers: Voya recognizes the importance of managing our supply chain and real estate in an
environmentally conscious manner. We have an Environmental Procurement Policy and conduct

Page 6 of 16

CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURESURVEY
VOYA Filed Date: August 30, 2024
related internal training. We also have a Supplier Code of Conduct policy to ensure our suppliers’
values, including environmental considerations, align with ours. This policy and code of conduct can
be found at https://www.voya.com/page/statements-and-policies.

+ Investors, Analysts, Clients and Prospective Clients, and the Public Generally: Voya communicates
information on ESG matters, including our environmental sustainability efforts and accomplishments,
in part by publishing an annual corporate responsibility Impact Report which can be found at
https://www.voya.com/page/esg-environmental-social-and-governance-reporting. We invite feed-
back by clearly outlining in the report how to contact us with input. We review all feedback we receive
and consider suggestions, as appropriate.

*+ Portfolio Companies (Investments): The majority of the Insurance Companies’ proprietary investments
are managed by our affiliated investment manager, Voya Investment Management (“Voya IM”). Voya
IM leverages a range of ESG data to inform its materiality determinations and identify ESG issues
(which may include climate-related risks and opportunities, carbon emissions, water, waste, etc.), on
which it may engage directly with selected issuers of these investments.

To advance Voya’s ESG (including climate-related) strategy and better integrate and manage identified

priorities, in 2022 Voya established an Enterprise ESG Practice Center of Excellence (“ESG COE”) designed

to further embed ESG considerations, including those related to climate, throughout the organization and
our businesses. The ESG COE is expected to drive future strategy, best practices and performance while
fostering innovation and is responsible for ESG performance monitoring, assessment, continuous
improvement, and reporting. As noted in the “Governance” section above, in 2023 Voya established a new

ESG governance structure that oversees the overall ESG strategy, execution, and reporting.

As part of our corporate responsibility activities, Voya follows a three-fold strategy towards reducing our

carbon footprint - measure, reduce, and compensate. This process begins with measuring our electricity

use, and business air and car travel to determine the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from operations.

We utilize the EPA Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator (SGEC) to calculate and report on our emissions

(see our further response under “Metrics and Targets” below). The year 2023 was the seventh consecutive

year that Voya was carbon neutral for scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas

Protocol. For 2023, Voya used renewable energy certificates (RECs) purchased from NextEra for indirect

emissions equal to at least 100% of our electricity use and carbon offsets from NextEra to compensate for

direct emissions from natural gas, steam, and fleet car use.

We work to reduce emissions in a range of different ways, including programs such as green electricity

purchases, implementing day lighting systems where lights automatically adjust based on natural lighting,

video conferencing programs to avoid travel-related emissions, and an enterprise-wide strategy to reduce
printing related impacts. Flexible work policies also support our emission reduction programs. We
purchase products that enable our operations to have a low impact on the environment.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw that our employees thrive with flexible work opportunities. As

a result, we have shifted to a hybrid work model — a Voya-wide effort to transform the way we work

together and interact with customers in a new world. We have eliminated certain offices in Arizona and
lowa, and reduced square footage use in Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minneapolis and New York.
Over the next several years, Voya intends to continue to reduce office space with the potential for further
operating and energy reductions. For the sites in which we operate, we incorporate, where possible,
requirements for sustainable cleaning and maintenance practices and the maintenance of current LEED
and Energy Star certifications.
Since introducing our strategy in 2007, Voya has reduced our environmental footprint by decreasing
electricity use, reducing paper and water consumption, and producing less landfill and e-waste. Total
energy consumption decreased 81% since the benchmark year of 2007. Total electric consumption was
down 50K MWh from the benchmark year of 2007. Paper use decreased by 95% in 2023 compared to our
2007 baseline. Waste to landfills was reduced by 95% compared to our 2007 baseline. Although 2023
saw an overall GHG emissions increase, we are below our pre-COVID numbers — a 12,834 CO2e
decrease in total business emissions from 2019 to 2023.
Our reported Scope 3 emissions include business travel, personal and rental car miles and waste. Higher
demand for business air and rail travel in 2023 was the main driver of increased reported Scope 3
emissions compared to 2022 (4,058 vs. 2,626 metric tons CO2e). We plan to look for new tools that will
help our teams calculate additional Scope 3 GHG emission categories in accordance with new legislation
and regulations.
We recognize that the responsible procurement of the goods and services we purchase has direct and
indirect environmental impacts. Voya’s Environmental Procurement Policy details the environmental
considerations of our purchasing decisions. In 2023, Voya received the EPEAT Purchaser Award recognized
by the Global Electronics Council (GEC) in the Computers and Displays category. This award highlights our
cross-functional collaboration, involving team members from Strategic Procurement Services and
Technology, to select technologies and suppliers that incorporate responsible practices throughout the
product lifecycle. These practices include sourcing materials, manufacturing or upcycling, shipping and
distribution, and disposal or recycling. Through our sustainable technology procurement practices, we
reduced 171,000 kilograms of CO2 equivalents in 2023 and 1.4 million kilograms of COz equivalents since
2019.
We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our business, including market, liquidity,
credit, operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. Voya's view of climate-related risks is aligned
with the TCFD view and is defined as the risks attributable to the physical and transition risks of climate
change. Climate change can be a driver of a number of risks in our risk taxonomy.
Transition risks relate to the transition to a lower-carbon economy and may include, for example, risks to
our investment portfolio and increased operating or compliance costs as a result of changing regulations,
and liabilities associated with the operation of real estate sites if the properties do not meet existing or
changing environmental regulatory standards.

In terms of physical risks, we are exposed to various risks arising from natural disasters, including
hurricanes, climate change, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and pandemic disease, as well as man-made
disasters and core infrastructure failures, including acts of terrorism, military actions, power grid and
telephone/internet infrastructure failures. As described further in the most recent Voya Financial Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (filed on Feb. 23, 2024) (“our 10-K”), the
occurrence of natural or man-made disasters may adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition by causing, among other things, adverse impacts on our investment portfolios, reduced sales,
increased claims, withdrawals, lapses and surrenders, declines in sales and revenues, extraordinary
assessments to support insurance guaranty associations, material harm to the financial condition of our
reinsurers, and disruption to our normal business operations.

‘A number of these risks materialized in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, which created material
economic disruption worldwide and had significant effects on our business operations, including our
operations in India and the operations of our third-party outsourcing providers.

In the event of any future disaster or disruption, there can be no assurance that our business continuation
and crisis management plan or insurance coverages would be effective in mitigating any negative effects
on operations or profitability, nor can we provide assurance that the business continuation and crisis
management plans of the independent distributors and outside vendors on which we rely for certain
services and products would be effective in mitigating any negative effects on the provision of such services
and products.

Voya may consider climate-related risks and opportunities when performing budgeting, forecasting, and
financial analysis. We recognize the occurrence of natural disasters may adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition, and that climate change may increase the probability of these harmful
events. Climate-related risks and opportunities may be among the factors considered when evaluating
opportunities to make acquisitions or divestments.

Although the likelihood of any climate-related risks occurring increases over time, as a general matter we
have not formally designated climate-related risks as being short, medium, or long term in nature. The
risks identified in this survey response are not an exhaustive list of risks we face that may be climate
related.
To help assess climate-related risks and opportunities, Voya has several data subscriptions that include
climate-related information, and has developed our own proprietary models and technology to better
understand how climate risk presents in our investment portfolio holdings and assist in forming ideas to
construct resilient portfolios. Voya IM has implemented an ESG governance structure, has been a
signatory of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) since 2018, has dedicated ESG resources, and
maintains ongoing education and dialogue to inform the impact of ESG factors on investment analyses.
\Voya continues to support the efforts to integrate ESG factors within the investment process, including
those relating to climate-change, as further described in the “Risk Management” section below.

Page 9 of 16

CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURESURVEY
VOYA Filed Date: August 30, 2024

Voya has been proactive in incorporating climate-related risk analysis within its risk management
framework as also further described in the ""Risk Management"" section below. In 2021, a qualitative
assessment was undertaken to identify and document climate-related risks pertinent to Voya's business
and operational spheres. This assessment focused on the potential impact of both physical and transition
risks on our established risk taxonomy categories. Notable risk drivers identified included regulatory
changes, disclosure mandates, extreme weather events, and evolving investor and consumer preferences.
Voya has since dedicated additional efforts towards sourcing tools and methodologies that facilitate both
qualitative and quantitative analysis of climate risk scenarios and their potential effects on our business.
In 2024, Voya engaged an external consultant to perform a qualitative scenario analysis (e.g., a 2°C or
lower scenario) which is underway.
Given the changing landscape in energy-related investments, the Insurance Companies continue to
increase investments in renewables that support the transition to a low-carbon economy, including private
credit investments. This includes alternative generating plants powered by wind, solar, hydro, and
geothermal, as well as transmission infrastructure linking like projects to the grid. The Insurance
Companies have maintained exposure to investment grade bonds of regulated utilities, and note that the
utility industry itself has moved toward deriving a higher percentage of power from alternative sources.
We believe that the highly regulated nature of utilities and provisions for rates of return that include cost
recovery, minimizes the risk of “stranded assets” as power generation mixes continue to evolve. Our utility
investments are focused in jurisdictions where the utility regulators properly recognize the need for
utilities to maintain access to the capital cost recovery aspect of rate setting and note that stranded costs
are avoidable in such properly functioning regulatory contexts.

3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.

Consider including the following:

* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate-related risks on its underwriting
portfolio, and how the company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to
physical, transition and liability risk.*

+ Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential
physical and transition climate-related risks, if applicable.*

+ Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment
portfolio, including what investment classes have been considered.*

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

Consider including the following:

* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how
frequently the process is completed.*

B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management.

Consider including the following:

+ Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's general enterprise
risk management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.

+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what
timeframes are considered,

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments,
including which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.

Voya recognizes that the occurrence of natural disasters may adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition, and that climate change may increase the probability of these harmful events. We have
robust risk management programs and processes in place to identify and assess significant risks impacting
the business, regardless of the source. The Risk Committee of the Voya Board assists the Voya Board in
overseeing and reviewing information regarding Voya’s Enterprise Risk Management, including policies,

Page 11 of 16

CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURESURVEY

VOYA Filed Date: August 30, 2024
procedures and practices used to manage all of the risks in our risk taxonomy that might be impacted by
climate-related risks.
‘As detailed in the ""Governance"" section, climate-related risks are managed as part of our broader
Enterprise Risk Management program. Our framework for assessing and managing climate-related risks
leverages subject matter experts across the enterprise, with key functions represented on the Voya ESG
Steering Committee workstreams. For example:

+ The qualitative assessment of climate-related risks is included in Voya’s emerging risk framework and
is reviewed by Voya's cross-functional Emerging Risk Forum and the Voya Management Risk
Committee annually and reported to the Voya Board’s Risk Committee.

+ We proactively identify, monitor, and manage various risks and threats to our operations through an
operational risk framework aimed at improving business resilience and preventing disruption and
loss. The operational framework is used to identify a broad range of risks and their financial and non-
financial impact to operations. Our Continuity Risk Policy covers Crisis Management, Business
Continuity, and Disaster Recovery. Voya updates emergency response plans annually for all major
sites/facilities throughout the U.S. to mitigate business disruption risk.

+ Asallfe insurer, we do not currently underwrite risks with direct exposure to climate. However, we
are assessing the impact of increased morbidity/mortality due to extreme climate changes on our
Health Solutions business. Claims frequency and severity is managed through the product
development/pricing process in setting assumptions for mortality, morbidity, and other factors.

+ Emerging ESG regulations, including climate-related regulations, are assessed as changes in laws and
regulations may materially increase the cost of compliance and other expenses of doing business as
emerging regulations may be unclear, subject to interpretation, or conflict with existing regulations.
For example, Voya is assessing and preparing for both the California Climate Rules and the SEC final
rule on climate disclosure so that the organization is ready to meet new reporting guidelines in the
proposed time frame should the various rules go into effect.

+ Voya may consider climate-related risk factors and potential impacts when making decisions to
purchase real estate or adopt leases. However, direct physical risk is limited as Voya leases much of
the office space it utilizes and the buildings that are owned are not in areas we view as at high risk of
becoming impaired due to a climate-related natural disaster. Furthermore, Voya maintains insurance
to protect against financial loss and employs business continuity plans to mitigate operational risks
associated with such events.

As part of the implementation of Voya's EG risk management framework, on a quarterly basis the Voya
IM Investment Policy Committee analyzes data procured from a specialized ESG data vendor to outline
restrictions in certain investments and business activities that do not meet Voya’s values on selected ESG
factors including toxic emissions. It reviews and takes into account both the investment and reputational
risks that may result from our investing in companies that do not meet our threshold criteria. Material

violations will prompt further reviews on a case-by-case basis, potentially influencing the viability of a
business relationship.
From a life insurer’s perspective, investment risk is a major area of focus when it comes to climate-related
risk, including both physical and transition risks. Voya recognizes that ESG factors including climate change
can impact the investment risk and return profiles of our investments. The Insurance Companies manage
investment risks in part by maintaining a diversified portfolio that takes into account a variety of risk factors,
and avoids over-concentration in specific sectors. General account investment guidelines include asset
class and sector limitations, individual issuer credit limits, and geographical concentration limits. The Voya
IM Investment Policy Committee considers the potential impact of certain risks that may be associated
with climate change such as natural disasters, as well as changes in regulatory environments that may
impact the risk-return profile of energy-related and other investments.
We believe that the incorporation of ESG information, including climate-related information, alongside
traditional financial investment factors, leads to better-informed investment decision-making and a more
holistic assessment of long-term investment risks and opportunities. Voya IM employs ESG integration,
defined as the systematic consideration of ESG factors, when relevant and material, alongside traditional
factors, into investment decisions and engages with issuers as part of our commitment to active
‘ownership. Voya continues to support the efforts to integrate ESG factors within the investment process,
with several examples described below and in the “Strategy” section above.
Voya IM’s Active Ownership (“AO”) Team aspires to improve the long-term sustainability of portfolio
companies by promoting ESG best practices through proxy voting and engagement activities as well as
collaborative discussions with other institutional shareholders. The AO Team's engagement notes are
made available to Voya IM’s investment teams. The AO Team will escalate an issue to the applicable
research analyst and/or portfolio manager if the AO Team believes that the company’s actions or inactions
could negatively impact the value of the securities in which the Insurance Companies invest. The
investment teams may also engage directly with the portfolio companies, and are able to escalate any
concerns they may have with a portfolio company to the AO Team and to Voya IM’s ESG Research teams.
For our portfolio companies and potential new investments, our expectation is that they recognize and
plan for the increasing risk of future physical damage caused by climate-related disasters. We expect that
they have strategies that consider the effects of the inevitable transition to a low-carbon global economy
and, as material and applicable, Voya IM typically assesses the following investee climate information:
carbon emissions; product carbon footprint; financing environmental impact; climate change vulnerability,
carbon target and policy; and exposure to climate regulation. Voya IM collects this data and research
related to these factors through a variety of sources including third party data vendors, sell-side and
specialty research providers, and directly from company reports and filings.
The Insurance Companies have real estate investment-related exposure to climate-related risk through
direct investments in commercial mortgages (“CMs”), as well as investments in commercial and
residential mortgage-backed securities. Voya IM has a team of professionals that underwrites each direct

Page 13 of 16

CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURESURVEY
VOYA Filed Date: August 30, 2024

commercial mortgage investment, taking into account factors such as current and anticipated property
values and P&C insurance. For new CML investments, Voya IM completes an ESG questionnaire during
the initial physical property inspection in conjunction with the applicable borrower, and uses an ESG
scorecard system that combines the results of a third-party carbon emissions report with the ESG
questionnaire to give each deal an ESG score. Voya IM uses this information as part of the risk assessment
of the potential investment. Voya IM also uses third-party carbon emissions reports to assess climate-
related risks for existing CML investments.
Separate teams manage commercial and residential mortgage-backed exposures, and take into account
the geographical diversity of both the mortgage pools underlying each individual security and the overall
collateral pool backing the Insurance Companies’ investments in mortgage-backed securities.
Diversification further alleviates the impact of asset price fluctuation that may result from climate-related
risk impacting commercial mortgage, real estate, and fixed income assets. Diversification may also mitigate
any climate change risks associated with sectors such as industrials, utilities, transportation, and other
sectors that may be impacted by regulatory developments, governmental policies, or other climate change
risks.
‘As noted in the “Strategy” section above, in 2024, Voya engaged an external consultant to perform a
qualitative scenario analysis as contemplated by the TCFD (e.g., a 2°C or lower scenario) which is underway.

METRICS AND TARGETS
4, Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
‘opportunities where such information is material. Consider including the following:

+ Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to
your business. Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe
models to assess, if any.

A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line
with its strategy and risk management process.

+ Consider the amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to
climate-related physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible],
alignment with climate scenarios, (1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR,
carbon intensity], and the amount of financed or underwritten carbon emissions)

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the
related risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
We test our emergency response plans for design and effectiveness using various scenarios that may
include weather events. Voya actively monitors pending weather and environmental conditions or
occurrences, such as winter storms, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, drought, wildfires, etc., and their
potential impacts, such as facility loss or damage, utility interruptions, critical infrastructure or technology
failures, staff shortages, criminal actions, third-party failures, ete.
With 99% of our employees working fully remotely or splitting their time between home and in-office,
Voya has been reducing office space to operate more sustainably and efficiently. We utilize the EPA
Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator (SGEC) to calculate and report on our emissions. Our scope 1, 2, and
3 emissions (measured in metric tons CO2e) measured for the calendar year 2023 were:
Scope 1: 1,359
Scope 2: 4,909
Scope 3: 4,058 (reporting is currently limited to waste generated in operations and business travel)

Governance
1. Disclose the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.
A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related
risks and opportunities.
‘The Vermont Blue Advantage, Inc. (VBA) Board of Directors (Board) oversees VBA's risk
management function. VBA‘s risk management framework utilizes an extensive process
to identify priority risks that pose the most significant potential financial impact to the
enterprise. Climate risk has not been specifically identified as a priority risk at this time
but may contribute to other identified priority risks such as benefit costs, health care
pricing, and investment portfolio performance. A confidential detailed assessment of
priority risks is produced annually and supplied to Vermont's Department of Financial
Regulation in VBA’s Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA).
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and
opportunities.
VBA is supported by the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function within the
Performance Management department of VBA’s ultimate parent, Blue Cross Blue Shield
of Michigan's Emerging Markets division. ERM is responsible for identifying areas of
concern and communicating with senior leadership to better understand risk, allowing
appropriate action to be identified and executed to address issues and leverage
opportunities, and reporting on risk to the VBA Board.

insurer's businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
‘A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over
the short, medium, and long term.
As stated earlier, climate risk has not yet been specifically identified as a separate
priority risk but may contribute to other priority risks such as benefit costs, health
care pricing, and investment portfolio performance detailed in the enterprise ORSA
report filed annually with DER.
To decrease our carbon footprint and preserve the environment, VBA’s parent
organizations, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) and Blue Cross Blue
Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT), have both established Blues Go Green initiatives. Efforts
include:
© Installed a 200-kilowatt solar energy system on the roof of BCBSM’s four-story
parking structure located in Detroit, Michigan, helping avoid adding 750
metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
© Additionally, the parking structure has an elaborate rainwater collection
system, allowing BCBSM to recycle rain and irrigation water to maintain
BCBSM's Detroit campus’ grounds.
© Both BCBSM and BCBSVT have digitized many health records, prioritized email
over printed memos and begun offering paperless/electronic explanations of
benefits to our members. The last option alone helped save more than 1,600
trees in just one year.
© BCBSVT launched the Corporate Sustainability Committee in 2015 to lead
socially and environmentally responsible initiatives to improve BCBSVT's
energy efficiency, reduce overall environmental impacts, and create a “green”
culture internally and externally.
© VBA has also introduced a new hybrid work model which is beneficial to the
environment. Most employees work from the office one day per week which
greatly reduces commuting trips and the overall emissions from the use of
motor vehicles.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s
business, strategy, and financial planning.

3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.
In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers
should consider including the following:

‘A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
\VBA's risk management is based on the COSO framework. VBA continues to manage
medical costs through underwriting criteria. The criteria include product design,
negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total
medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of
each service and the type of service rendered.
Factors that may impact medical costs include medical cost inflation, increased use of
services, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical
emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of
new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly
mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics.
\VBA‘s risk identification process is integrated and collaborative. Input is gathered from
multiple sources to compose a comprehensive view of the internal and external
environment. ERM partners with the Office of the General Auditor and Corporate
Compliance (OGACC) and the Model Audit Rule (MAR) department to conduct an
annual, comprehensive risk assessment process.
VBA maintains a public facing website, that includes news and information for members.
This includes articles and tips on how to live a healthier life.

B. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks.

‘A key source of risk information is the risk and opportunity analysis embedded in the
annual capital planning process. The capital plan assesses drivers of uncertainty and risk
around underwriting forecasts, the drivers of volatility (including medical and pharmacy
trend, membership, risk adjustment, administrative expenses, investments, and
subsidiaries) and management plans to address the risks. Each of these risk and
opportunity drivers are reviewed with the appropriate levels of management. The
capital plan is also reviewed and approved annually by the VBA Board.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer’s overall risk management.
All risks, including potential impact posed by climate-related risk, are intended to be

Introduction
Sentry Insurance Group takes a long-term perspective when making decisions, focusing on growing the
value of our organization while managing risk to best service our customers and associates. We strongly
believe in the benefits of diversification in our varied underwriting and investment portfolios as we strive
to provide a variety of products and services to individuals and businesses. This diversification, combined
with our risk management philosophy and strong capital position, equips Sentry to endure both short-
and long-term risks.
Global climate change has presented, and will continue to present, significant risks and opportunities to
the global economy including insurance companies. We recognize the importance of assessing these risks
and identify the opportunities that climate change presents for on our business strategy and operations.
Below, Sentry submits our NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey in alignment with the reporting
framework set by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD) for the calendar year 2023.

NAIC CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE SURVEY
TCFD-ALIGNED QUESTIONS
UPDATED 2022
GOVERNANCE
1. Disclose the insurer’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.

In disclosing the insurer's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities insurers should consider
including the following:

* Identify and include any publicly stated goals on climate-related risks and opportunities.

* Describe where climate-related disclosure is handled within the insurer’s structure, e.g., at a group level,

entity level, or a combination. If handled at the group level, describe what activities are undertaken at the

company level.

A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and

opportunities.
In describing the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the climate-
related financial risks, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the

climate-related financial risks.

B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Company's Response:
While it is WEG National Title Insurance Company's (WFG) belief that climate change does not pose a material risk to
the title insurance industry, nor title insurance policyholders. WEG recognizes the importance of monitoring climate
change and the increased risk it poses, and also is committed to supporting environmental responsibility internally
and with its vendors.
As a private company with no identified material climate-related risk, WFG does not publish goals that are available
to the public.
WFG’s Enterprise Risk Management program is overseen by executive management, operating as WFG Risk
Management Committee, and reports risks, findings, advisement, and opportunities to the board on a quarterly
basis. Executive management receives risk analysis reports from WFG’s Risk Assessment Committee which is run by
WFG’s Compliance and Audit department and is comprised of a select group of leaders throughout the company. The
Risk Assessment Committee performs an annual risk analysis on all the potential risks that may impact WFG’s
operations and its consumer. Including and not limited to; Human Resources, Operational, Claims, Policies,
Information Security, Cyber Security, Information Technology, Environmental Social Governance, Compliance and
Regulation, Vendors, and Climate Change.
In the event a climate-related risk is identified, depending on the details of the risk this may be handled on the
corporate and/or entity level.

STRATEGY
2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and
financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and financial
planning, insurers should consider including the following:

carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
Company's Response:
At this time WEG does not feel climate change poses a material risk to WFG’s business. Therefore a formal strategy
for the handling of climate change has not been developed.
‘As mentioned earlier, WFG is committed to supporting environment responsibility internally and externally with its
vendors. This has been done by promoting the following initiatives and changes within its organization.
‘© Use of LED Bulbs where permissible
‘© When available, use 100% recycled paper, non-toxic inks in pens & highlighters or refillable cartages
‘* Housekeeping reminders to turn off lights in unused areas, turn off faucets after washing hands, and recycle
when possible.

* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting portfolio, and
how the company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to physical, transition and liability
risk. *
* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential physical
and transition climate related risks, if applicable. *
* Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment portfolio,
including what investment classes have been considered. *

considered.
Company's Response:
As presented previously, while WFG National Title Insurance Company does not believe that climate change poses a
material risk within the title insurance industry or its policyholders; WFG’s Enterprise Risk Management program
does monitor and assess the potential risk. This is done in conjunction with WFG’s annual risk assessment, which is
performed by WFG’s Risk Assessment Committee.
METRICS AND TARGETS
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and opportunities
where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your business.
Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to assess, if any.

A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:
* In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the
amount of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related
physical risks [answer in absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate
scenarios, (1 in 100 years probable maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount
of financed or underwritten carbon emissions.
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related
risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
* Asterisks represent questions derived from the original Climate Risk Disclosure Survey.
Company's Response:
‘As mentioned previously, as a title insurer, WFG does not believe that climate-risk poses a material risk to its
operations or insurers. Therefore, currently, WFG does not have metrics and targets to report.

Climate-related disclosure

Wawanesa’s climate-related disclosures are consolidated and presented at the group/enterprise level.
Climate disclosure is developed by a cross-functional climate reporting working group, including the
Sustainability, Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Finance functions.

Sustainability Function The sustainability function has the overall
responsibility to provide guidance on Wawanesa’s
climate strategy and manage cross-functional
collaboration for execution.

Enterprise Risk Management The ERM function collaborates with our business
and support units in Canada and the U.S,, including
‘our P&C and Life operations, in aggregating the
various initiatives and plans to manage current
and future climate related risks.

Finance The finance function provides guidance on TCFD
reporting requirements as well as regulatory
climate reporting and is responsible for the
integrated IFRS/ISSB regulatory reporting while
providing inputs into the quantification of the
financial impacts of climate risks and
‘opportunities.

Disclosure content is also provided by Compliance, Reinsurance, Claims, and Operations/Products.

A. Describe the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of climate-related risks and
‘opportunities.

In describing the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing the
climate-related financial risks, insurers should consider including the following:

* Describe the position on the board and/or committee responsible for the oversight of managing

climate- related financial risks.
‘As an extension of its mutuality, the parent company, Wawanesa Mutual, is committed to sustainable
business practices, including management of climate risks and opportunities. In providing oversight of
these practices, the Board engages in the following, among other activities:
© overseeing the development and implementation of the Company's sustainability governance
framework; and
© monitoring the Company's: (a) performance against its sustainability commitments and
strategies; (b) sustainability reporting practices; and (c) compliance with regulatory
requirements as they pertain to sustainability
The Board has delegated to its risk committee oversight of the governance of the Company's climate-
related risks. To this end, the risk committee regularly reviews management reporting pertaining to the
Company's climate and other sustainability-related risks, as well as climate-related risks and trends to
which the Company is exposed. Where applicable, such reporting details the effectiveness of the
Company's activities in governing these risks, as well as any material deficiencies in their management. In
2

keeping with its oversight role, the risk committee recommends for board approval any measures it
believes appropriate in relation to the prudent and effective management of climate-related and other
risks.
Oversight of climate-related opportunities rests with the full board, which has oversight of the formulation
and execution of the Company's strategic direction, plans and priorities, including climate change.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Several senior management committees are in place with responsibility for overseeing and monitoring
various policies, processes and risks that are impacted by climate change at the enterprise level.
Our Executive Risk and Compliance Committee (ERC) is responsible for oversight of the risk management
process, including climate risks, and the Compliance group is responsible for monitoring new climate
related laws and regulations.
Our Reinsurance Committee oversees Wawanesa’s Reinsurance Policy and objectives to provide financial
security, stability in our loss experience, access to capacity and technical underwriting expertise. Climate
risk is directly considered within these objectives, with key risk indicators monitored on a quarterly basis.
The Executive Sustainability Committee (ESC) oversees Wawanesa’s overall approach to sustainability,
which includes managing climate-related risks and opportunities within our business. The efforts of the
ESC are supported and implemented by functions across the business including a dedicated sustainability
function that is responsible for program management of Wawanesa’s enterprise sustainability strategy,
and the operations functions that consider the impacts of climate risk in our approach to products, pricing,
reinsurance, and concentration limits. In 2023, a Climate Council was initiated to coordinate these cross-
functional groups as the focus on climate increases. This Council is currently focused on reporting
requirements, a climate risk management framework, improving emission data, and the early stages of
drafting a transition plan.
Wawanesa also has various operational policies and committees that inherently manage climate risk as a
‘top and emerging risk, such as Pricing, Product, Capital Management, Regulatory Compliance
Management, Investment Policy Statement, etc.

Strategy - narrative
Q2. Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s
businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
In disclosing the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's
businesses, strategy and financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
* Describe the steps the insurer has taken to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate risk
and resiliency.
* Describe the insurer's plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in its
operations or organizations.
Engaging constituents
Wawanesa educates our customers and communities in the U.S. on wildfire and sustainability topics on
our website blog at Wawanesa.com. We bring awareness to customers and communities through sharing
content in our quarterly e-newsletter, and on social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and
Linkedin. Examples of this information include topics on wildfire season preparation and evacuation.
At a group level, Wawanesa continues to actively engage with and participate on several external
committees and organizations focused on sustainability and climate-change matters, including Climate
Proof Canada, the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the
International Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation (ICMIF) Prevention & Resilience Working
Group.
Managing GHG emissions
The Climate Council Operational Emissions Working Group is a cross-functional group of leaders
designated to advance the measurement and reduction of our operational greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, achieve our GHG goals, and contribute to the Wawanesa Net Zero Transition Plan.
Current and planned activities to reduce GHG emissions include maintaining LEED certification on select
buildings, increasing focus on sustainability in procurement, reducing overall office space, optimizing fleet
management practices, reducing the number of fleet vehicles, transitioning to more fuel efficient and
hybrid vehicles. The focus is also on obtaining better data to have a more complete and accurate GHG
inventory to enable us to make more informed decisions on further GHG reduction activities.
Wawanesa’s Distributed Work Program (DWP) provides flexibility to employees and reduces our overall
carbon footprint. Work duties can be performed in the office or from home. With the DWP, employees
choose how and where they want to work- the office, from home, or a hybrid mix of time spent at both.
As part of our quantification of Scope 3 emissions we plan to calculate the associated emissions from
employee commuting and business travel linked to the DWP.

‘A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
medium, and long term.
In describing the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short, medium,
and longer term, insurers should consider including the following.
* Define short, medium, and long-term, if different than 1-5 years as short term, 5-10 years as
medium term, and 10-30 years as long term.
We define time frames based on guidance set out in our enterprise risk management framework.
‘Across the Enterprise, we describe climate risk as the risk of financial losses or strategic disadvantage due
to the transition to a lower-carbon economy or the physical impacts of climate change. This includes the
outcomes of both transition risk (policy, legal, technology, reputation, and market changes) as well as
physical event-driven (acute) losses or longer-term (chronic) shifts in climate patterns.
In 2022, the Corporate Strategy and Sustainability team conducted a risk assessment of physical and
transitional risks that climate change presents over the next 1-3 years, which was used to inform strategy
development and prioritize execution of key deliverables. This risk assessment was done in accordance
with Wawanesa’s Enterprise Risk Management Policy and reviewed by the Enterprise Risk Management
team. Although the risk assessment performed was focused on the short-term implications of climate
change, it is defined as a unique risk with long term impacts and interdependencies across other top and
‘emerging risks.
The table below outlines our high-level assessment of physical and transition risks for our business.

required to reduce Wawanesa’s own emissions
Climate linked opportunities
© Developing and integrating climate considerations in our communications and product offerings
will provide value to our members, especially around loss prevention, while also improving
opportunities for our market reputation and reach.
© Identifying new sources of data to help identify and manage concentration risks.
© Ability to reprice P&C products annually and perform regular product review.
© The transition from fossil fuels toward clean energy could create new investment opportunities
for Wawanesa’s portfolio such as renewable and green tech investments, alternative energy,
alternative transportation etc.
© Decreasing energy and emissions in our operations in areas such as facilities, fleet, travel, and
paper has the potential to decrease expenses and increase our reputation with employees and
clients.
B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy,
and financial planning.
In describing the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer’s business, strategy, and
financial planning, insurers should consider including the following:
+ Discuss if and how the insurer provides products or services to support the transition to a low
carbon economy or helps customers adapt to climate-related risk.
* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon economy.
Helping customers adapt to climate-related risk
As discussed in the previous section, Wawanesa uses several channels to educate our customers and
communities in the U.S. on wildfire and sustainability topics through a blog, e-newsletter and on social
media.
In accordance with California's wildfire safety regulation, Wawanesa is in the process of finalizing a pricing
plan which would include discounts and credits designed to encourage preventative behaviors, such as
using more resilient building materials, clearing brush and vegetation around the home, installing in-home
water sprinklers, etc.
Wildfire Defense Systems (WS) is a loss prevention service included with our California Homeowner's
policy. WDS is the largest insurance resource wildfire fleet in the USA. They have experience and
6

capabilities to reduce the insured-loss risk posed by the increasing threat of wildfire due to climate change.
They analyze risk, monitor fires, and respond to fire threats. In addition, WDS staffs trained wildfire
professionals who are dispatched to policyholders’ properties when a fire threatens the home and will
protect and defend the home against the fire with services such as spraying flame-retardant foam.
Investments to support the transition to a low carbon economy.
Within Wawanesa General's investment portfolio, 100% of the P&C assets are invested with external
investment managers. All the external investment managers in our P&C portfolio are signatories to the
UN PRI, have firm-level ESG policies and committees dedicated to the integration of ESG factors in the
investment process, and engage directly with company management on ESG issues. A sustainable
investments strategy to support the transition to a low carbon environment has been developed and the
Investments team has engaged the Investment Committee of the Wawanesa Board of Directors on a
timeline of this initiative. This includes assessing sustainable investment opportunities across asset classes
and investments to support the transition to a low carbon environment.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
Wawanesa currently leverages multiple scenario-based tools and processes to model the impact of
adverse events, including climate change. The two critical ones are the Canadian regulatory Financial
Condition Testing (FCT) and the Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) stress tests. Both involve projecting
forward Wawanesa’s strategic business plan, then shocking with adverse events to better understand its
financial impact, capital resiliency and possible management actions in response to the event.
Climate change was previously one of the Own Risk Solvency Assessment stress tests completed with the
results presented to the Risk Committee of the Board. The stress event modeled included a shock to
invested assets, and a loss of business due to reputation risk (transition risks) and a climate related
increase in catastrophe events and reinsurance costs (physical risk). The stress test results demonstrated
that capital levels were resilient within internal targets. No specific scenarios were modeled to assess the
impact of a 2-degree Celsius impact. Climate risk will be considered as part of future ORSA and FCT work
relating to the shorter-term transition and longer-term more volatile physical risks. The results of these
scenarios will help in assessing Wawanesa’s climate risk resilience considering their overall strategy.

Risk Management - narrative

Q3. Disclose how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risk

In disclosing how the insurer identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, insurers should
consider including the following:

* Describe how the insurer considers the impact of climate related risks on its underwriting portfolio,
and how the company is managing its underwriting exposure with respect to physical, transition and
liability risk.

* Describe any steps the insurer has taken to encourage policyholders to manage their potential physical
and transition climate related risks, if applicable.

+ Describe how the insurer has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its investment
portfolio, including what investment classes have been considered.

Managing impacts of climate related risks on the underwriting portfolio
Wawanesa relies on conservative underwriting practices, accurate valuation of the homes we insure,
development and implementation of prevention best practices, proper pricing of our insurance products
and purchasing adequate reinsurance to manage climate-related risks.
‘Wawanesa’s risks are consistently monitored and reviewed to ensure that price levels are sufficient over
a one-year time horizon. Although climate risk represents a longer-term shift in future cost changes,
‘Wawanesa utilizes third party wildfire scores to support underwriting and pricing practices to manage its
exposure to wildfire risk.
The enterprise is currently implementing a 3-year Prevention approach using the International
Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation (ICMIF) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk
Reduction (UNDRR) report ""From protection to prevention: The role of cooperative and mutual insurance
in disaster risk reduction,"" which identified practical terms to shift focus on providing risk transfer
products and services as a means to protect the insured from disaster risks, to an emphasis on prevention
through disaster risk reduction.
Managing impacts of climate related risks on the investment portfolio
Wawanesa has taken steps over the last several years to incorporate climate-related risk assessments
(both physical and transition) into our investment program, including consideration of environmental
practices in our Investment Beliefs Statement, consideration of climate transition risk in our investment
management strategies, ongoing engagement with the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors
on portfolio climate risk analysis, and annual reviews with our external investment managers on ESG
factors within our portfolio.
The investment team leverages a third-party system for additional climate risk modeling capabilities on
our publicly traded securities. Risk scenarios are available to assess the transition and physical risk on our
investment portfolios based upon underlying holdings. The overall analysis is designed to provide a
forward-looking and return-based valuation assessment to measure climate related risks and
opportunities in an investment portfolio.

In 2023, the Investment Committee of the Board approved the Wawanesa Sustainable Investment
Strategy. In addition to the Scope of the Policy and Roles and Responsibilities, this Policy includes the
following components that had been discussed with the Investment Committee at previous meetings: our
investment sustainability belief, commitments, approach as it relates to incorporating sustainability into
our asset allocation, external investment manager selection, internal investment management, the use of
active versus passive management, GHG emission reduction, Impact Investing, proxy voting, engagement
and collaborative action.

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

In describing the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, insurers should
consider including the following:

* Discuss whether the process includes an assessment of financial implications and how frequently the
process is completed. *

Wawanesa identifies top and emerging risks through annual and quarterly risk discussions and analysis,
where climate-related risks are assessed. Climate-related risks are multifaceted and systemic, and impact

other risks identified and assessed. The quarterly risk discussions are largely qualitative, however

Wawanesa analyses interdependencies quantitatively as part of the annual OSRA and FCT scenario

modelling exercise.

Wawanesa identifies current exposure to climate change and weather-related risk through review of
catastrophe models and examination of automobile and homeowner insurance book of business.
‘Wawanesa continuously adapts our policy coverages and reinsurance contracts as required, based on the

review.

B. Describe the insurer’s processes for managing climate-related risks.

Climate risk exposure is managed by the Company's conservative underwriting practices, greater accuracy

in valuation of properties to ensure adequate limits of coverage, proper pricing of our insurance products

and appropriate limits of reinsurance.

Wawanesa’s Enterprise Risk Management Team undertakes quarterly risk reviews and updates to

management and the board of directors for top and emerging risks. This process includes extensive

consultation with business units to inform the assessment. These evolving risk discussions are intended
to embed a continuously improving risk culture based on risk awareness and ownership and to account
for risks that emerge during the year and include climate-related risks.

Wawanesa also employs an enterprise-wide concentration risk management process to better identify

areas with significant catastrophe risk and will establish risk management limits and thresholds.

Establishing concentration limits helps limit Wawanesa’s exposure to aggregation of risk in areas with

significant current and future catastrophic losses, notably considering climate-related changes to

policyholder risk profiles. The U.S. deployed a concentration risk tool to manage wildfire concentration risk

in 2022. We have plans to develop a similar tool to manage EQ risk in the future.

C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated
into the insurer’s overall risk management.

In describing how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated
into the insurer's overall risk management, insurers should consider including the following:

‘* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-risk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including which
risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are considered.

General Enterprise Risk Management Process
Climate-related risks are addressed through Wawanesa’s general enterprise-risk management process.
The potential impact of climate change has been identified through economic capital stress testing, with
the results presented to the Risk Committee of the Board.
‘Annually, Wawanesa's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team identifies and assesses top and emerging
risks facing Wawanesa through a risk consultation with business leaders across the enterprise and a review
of risks identified in industry publications. The risks and any potential changes are reviewed and updated
quarterly through similar risk consultations. Top and emerging risks facing Wawanesa include Climate /
Catastrophe both from a physical risk and transition risk perspective.
The significance of climate-related risks is determined based on risk assessments that support the
identification and assessment of top and emerging risks. The factors to determine the level of risk are
approved by management and include potential financial, insurance, operational, legal/regulatory, and
strategic impacts.
Climate Scenario Modeling for Underwriting Risks
‘A review of the Company's climate-related risk modeling is currently underway. The objective of this
project is to provide insight into the design and operational effectiveness of the climate-related risk
modelling framework, as well as the strategic preparedness related to addressing increasing severity and
frequency of extreme weather events and long-term shifts in climate patterns caused by climate change.
This review will assess the organization's progress with the development of climate-related scenario
analysis to assess the impact of climate-related risk drivers on its risk profile and business strategy.
Climate Scenario Modeling for Investment Risks
Work is underway by the investment team leveraging third-party software to enhance climate risk
modeling capabilities. The focus is on publicly traded securities. Risk scenarios are available to assess the
transition and physical risk on our investment portfolios based upon underlying holdings. The overall
analysis is designed to provide a forward-looking and return-based valuation assessment to measure
climate related risks and opportunities in an investment portfolio.

Metrics and Targets
Q4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:
© Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your
business. Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to
assess, if any.
Wawanesa’s catastrophe modeling incorporates all major exposure perils including earthquake, severe
convective storm, wildfire, and flooding. The catastrophe models are used for two key areas of the
business: monitoring of risk and concentration and purchasing of the reinsurance program. The
catastrophe models are created and parameterized by third-party vendors and, to the extent possible,
they account for climate risk and changes over a one-year time horizon. Although the forecast period is
‘only one-year forward, climate-related risks are also managed through the reinsurance agreements and
proactively monitored through the catastrophe modeling exercise.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with
its strategy and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with
its strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:
'* In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the amount
of exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related physical risks

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the
related risks.
Wawanesa’s GHG Inventory is designed to follow the overarching principles for corporate GHG inventory
reporting as defined by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD) in the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004).
Wawanesa uses an operational control approach for the inventory boundary. The boundaries include 41
corporate offices across Canada and the US.
The following GHG emission sources are included in Wawanesa’s operational boundary:
‘Scope 1 (""Direct”): Natural gas combustion (for heating), Mobile Combustion (Canadian fleet),
Fugitive Emissions from Refrigeration and Air Conditioning and;
© Scope 2 (“Energy Indirect”): Purchased electricity.
We're still in the process of completing the inventory for 2023, which will not be completed prior to the
submission of these survey responses.
Risks associated with Wawanesa’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions include:
*  Reputational risks associated with increasing stakeholder expectations for climate action relative
to our climate related commitments; and
© Increasing operational costs due to rising energy prices and purchasing low-carbon technologies
that will be required to reduce emissions.
The quantification of Scope 3 insured emissions for the Enterprise is in review. Investment emissions will
be released in the inaugural Sustainability Report in 2024.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
In 2023, we gained approval for operational and investment emission/impact targets.

In 2023, the Company formed a dedicated ESG Forum (‘the Forum’) to reflect the Company's broader
focus on ESG policies, processes and disclosures, with a direct reporting line to the Executive Committee
and Board of Directors. The Climate Council, a subcommittee of the Forum, is designed to review and
manage climate-related risks and opportunities throughout the business and associated with strategy,
financial planning, underwriting and investment decisions and product development. The cross-functional
membership of the Forum and Climate Council helps embed ESG goals, objectives, and initiatives into the
strategy and operations of the Company. The members of the Forum and Climate Council represent a
myriad of business functions, including Actuarial, Risk, DEI&B, Human Resources, AmTrust International,
Governance and Regulatory Counsel, Legal Counsel, Investments, Operations, Commercial P&C,
Specialty Risk, Compliance, Treasury, Underwriting, Real Estate, and Exposure Management.
At the March 2024 meeting of the Company's Board of Directors, the Chief People & Communications
Officer (""CP&CO"") reporting on the significant development of the Company's first annual sustainability
report (""Business & Sustainability Review"") and then shared the report with the Company's Board of
Directors several weeks later. The Company is also working with a third-party to track baseline Scope 1
and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is developing metrics to establish a benchmark for the
‘Company.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Company's Enterprise Risk Management (""ERM"") function is responsible for monitoring climate-related
risks that impact the Company's insurance business. The Company's Global CRO provides the Company's
Audit Committee with an ERM report each quarter, a portion of which is dedicated to climate risks. A climate
change financial stress is considered in AmTrust's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) summary
reports annually.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment as it relates to natural catastrophe risks is in place
and embedded in ERM. The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee, which identifies new and
changing risks to the business.
Within the quarterly ERM report, risks are identified by category (e.g., financial, operational, strategic,
external and insurance) and sub-category (market, credit, liquidity, etc.) At the business unit level, the risk
management process consists of, but is not limited to, stakeholder discussions with key executives and risk
‘owners, examinations of risk state by risk category, reviews of design and control effectiveness test results,
where deemed necessary. AmTrust’s ERM team members continue to gain skills and knowledge for
assessing and managing climate risks by attending training events, industry events and other forums. The
ERM team uses data from the scientific community and resources provided by the TCFD guidance to advise
the ERM team and keep up to date of potential consequences or opportunities of climate-related impacts.
Two Board members, one of whom is responsible for the oversight of the Company's management of
climate risks, are members of the Company's management Risk Committee and attend the Company's
Audit Committee meetings. The Audit Committee, supported by Intemal Audit, provides independent
assurance on the design and effectiveness of the overall system of intemal control, including risk
management and compliance. Internal Audit is independent of both the business and the ERM function
and reports directly to the Audit Committee

Hybrid work model:

© The Company's hybrid work model implemented in 2021 also helps to reduce emissions as
employees are driving less mileage to work.

A. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the insurer has identified over the short,
‘medium, and long term.
‘AmTrust is a commercial property and casualty insurance group that focuses on small businesses. The
‘Company provides workers’ compensation coverage and other commercial coverages for small and
medium-sized businesses. The businesses AmTrust insures include restaurants, retail stores, small
artisan contractors and medical and professional offices. The Company also provides coverage to
apartment buildings, condominiums, and hotels. Even though AmTrust is the third largest workers’
‘compensation insurer in the U.S., 96% of its workers’ compensation policies have annual premiums that
are less than $25,000. The Company's other commercial property and casualty lines also target smaller
businesses.
‘AmTrust also is one of the leading warranty insurers in the U.S. The Company provides the insurance
backstop for auto warranties issued by manufacturers and other warranty providers. The Company also
insures warranties on consumer products offered by many leading brands. These products protect tens
of thousands of consumers. The Company does not insure big businesses or high hazard industries.
The Company has identified five core climate-related risk categories by leveraging guidance provided by
independent experts, regulators and the Company's own assessment of which categories are most likely
to elicit a better understanding of the financial risks facing the Company. Within each core risk category,
material risk factors were identified over various time horizons.
Five core climate-related risk categories identified are as follows:
1. Physical Risks
‘+ Description: immediate risks arising from weather-related events and slow onset climate
changes
ee! =;

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
+ Examples:
i. Risks associated with increased claims activity and reserve strengthening across
the various lines of business
1. Short- to long-term: severe storms (Property) and other weather events
(Warranty)
2. Long-term: increasing sea level (Property)
ji, Short- to long-term: extreme weather events may disrupt business continuity by
negatively impacting AmTrust carriers’ infrastructure and systems
2. Investment Risks
‘+ Description: risks arising from the exposure to market value deterioration of investments
driven by a current or expected impact of behavior relating to climate change
+ Examples:

i. Short-term: material and unforeseen drop in the value of an investment
holdings resulting from the perception that the issuer will be negatively
impacted by climate change related events or market activity

ji, Long-term: loss of market confidence in issuer to adapt business model to
address climate change related events or market demands

3. Transition Risks
‘+ Description: financial risks arising from the transition to a lower-carbon economy
including changes to policies, regulations and public perception
+ Examples:

i. Medium- to long-term: lower demand for current product offering distributed
through traditional methods, including auto warranty and the shift away from.
diesel and gas fuel sources

ji, Medium to long-term: lower demand for consumer electronics and major
appliances that do not comply with the market's perception of meeting
adequate environmental standards

iii, Medium- and long-term: introduction of new technologies which render
products currently offered (or insured) by AmTrust as obsolete, requiring a shift
to new products and distribution channels

iv. Medium-term: new policies and regulations that restrict products that are
included in AmTrust's business plan

4. Liability (Litigation) Risks
‘+ Description: risks of actions initiated by claimants who have suffered loss and damage
arising from climate change
+ Examples:

i. Short to medium-term: business partners (including reinsurance
counterparties) introducing strict climate-related minimum standards which
may be onerous

ji, Medium- to long-term: Climate litigation against AmTrust itself or its
policyholders, specifically those covered by its Professional Indemnity and or
any Director & Officer (""D&O"") Insurance policies for failing to avoid or
minimize adverse impacts on the climate, or failing to adapt to climate change

5. Reputational Risks
‘+ Description: risks of negative publicity resulting from support (i.e. investment, partnership,
etc.) in organizations that are seen to exacerbate climate change or perceived inaction by
AmTrust to reverse its practices that are seen to contribute to climate change
+ Examples:
ee! 7

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024

i. Short- to medium-term: Regulatory — Increased scrutiny by regulators as a
result of a real or perceived unmitigated exposure to climate related risks
including those mentioned in the other risk categories

ji, Short- to medium-term: Market confidence — the insurance market (agents,
brokers and policyholders) losing faith in AmTrust due to a real or perceived
unmitigated exposure to climate related risks including those highlighted in the
other risk categories

iii, Short- to medium-term: Rating agencies and other third parties losing faith in
AmTrust's abilty to effectively manage climate change related risks

iv. Medium- to long-term: Losing market share due to an increased desire to work
with companies that take public and proactive steps to combat the causes of
climate change. Given the power of social media, the impact of this risk could
be both rapid and substantial.

v. Short. to medium-term: Talent management — difficulty attracting and retaining
employees due to the Company's negative impact on climate.

B. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the insurer's business,

strategy, and financial planning.

‘Two specific areas are being prioritized as they present more risk to AmTrust based on its current strategic

and financial position.

1. Property Insurance: While each line of business AmTrust underwrites is vulnerable to various risk
factors arising from the changing climate, Property insurance is currently seen as the most likely to
experience negative impacts as a result of rising sea levels or changing weather patterns. As described
below in Section C, AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such
as hurricanes, storm surge, inland flooding or wildfires. AmTrust manages its exposure to adverse
weather risks through disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control and
risk transfer. AmTrust's property segment is a small part of its insured portfolio overall
Climate-related losses have not been a material threat to the Company's solvency. AmTrust has a
relatively low exposure to severe weather and catastrophe-type insurance events. AmTrust's insurance
contracts renew annually, which would enable a quick response to changes, as needed, by adjusting
pricing or by restricting exposure.

2. Investment Value Deterioration: AmTrust maintains conservative and diversified investment portfolios

but the market impacts of climate change to companies in which AmTrust invests is difficult to anticipate
and could lead to deteriorations in the valuation of related investment holdings.
The Company has analyzed its investment portfolio to determine what its concentration in fossil fuels
and other carbon-related holdings. The Company's fossil fuel investments comprise less than 10% of
its overall investment portfolio, which is mainly comprised of readily marketable invest ment-grade fixed-
income securities with relatively short duration. As such, climate change risk on the Company's
investment portfolio is currently low due to any impact taking place over a longer time horizon than the
average duration of the portfolio. The Company's corporate bond portfolio is well diversified by sector
and issuer and the impact of climate change, if any, on the creditworthiness of any issuer is insignificant
in the context of the whole portfolio. The Company believes climate risk is tempered by a relatively
short duration portfolio comprised of diverse issuers, which allows the Company to react and reposition
quickly to emerging climate risks.

The Company has taken steps to engage its key constituencies, including policyholders, agents and other

partnerships, on the topic of climate risk and resiliency.

ee! =:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
AmTrust proactively encourages its policyholders to reduce the potential losses caused by climate
influenced events through methods such as:

‘+ Utilization of AmTrust’s highly knowledgeable producer base to provide policyholder education
and guidance on purchasing appropriate coverages needed to mitigate specific risk exposures.

‘+ Policyholder notifications providing loss mitigation strategies and notices for ascertaining
coverage for certain catastrophic coverage through other Federal programs, such as flood
insurance.

+ AmTrust provides online news releases, videos and links to important resources, e.g.
disastersafety.org and Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety...all aimed at proactively
educating and training its customers on potential risk hazards and exposures along with mitigation
analysis, tips and solutions for flood, wind, winter weather, including top convective events

‘+ AmTrust provides Loss Control services that identify various exposures to its policyholders’
property and their ability to produce income that include means of mitigating weather related
losses induced by climate change.

In addition, the Company has ongoing partnerships to support its commitment to appropriately managing
environmental risks.

‘+ Partnered with a third-party to create industry first electric VSC (vehicle service contract) covering
batteries, and have partnered with various other administrators to expand AmTrust's green
footprint.

‘+ Developed and launched service contract program for electric vehicle residential charging station.

‘+ Ongoing research for whole home green infrastructure offerings to bundle coverage for electric
vehicles, at-home charging stations, solar panels, and electricity storage units.

+ AmTrust Title's energy division is dedicated to supporting the growth of clean energy initiatives by
partnering with developers, investors, and lending partners to navigate the unique challenges of
energy project goals. AmTrust's range of energy projects includes wind and solar farms, battery
storage, hydroelectric, hydrogen, liquid nitrogen gas, renewable natural gas, and transmission
lines.

C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-
related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.

Property Insurance -

As the potential for property damage increases because of the changing climate, itis critical to maintain a
strong understanding of the myriad of factors that impact the assessment of properties within AmTrust's
portfolio. The mitigants, as outlined below, explain further the Company's steps to reduce the negative
effects of major catastrophic events.

Mitigants:

‘+ AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such as hurricanes,
storm surge, inland flooding or wildfires. The Company manages its exposure to adverse weather
risks through disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control, and risk
transfer.

‘+ AmTrust considers extreme weather events in pricing and underwriting its insurance products. To
determine the premium associated with the costs of these extreme events the Company relies on
historical storm data, as well as utilizing catastrophe models to supplement this historical data due
to the infrequent nature of extreme weather events

+ ERM’s Exposure Management Team has been regularly performing detailed analysis over the
property and workers’ compensation insurance portfolios for AmTrust as a whole. On a quarterly
basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models.
Hurricane modelled results are based on warm sea surface temperatures catalogues, which
recognize the near/medium term view on sea-surface temperatures, thereby capturing recent
trends. AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year
catastrophe probable maximum loss (""PML"") be protected by reinsurance purchases for property.

ee! =:

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
The modelled 1:250-year catastrophe PML for property and workers’ compensation are monitored
against approved risk appetites. In addition, the Company runs Lloyd's Realistic Disaster
‘Scenarios to estimate the potential losses incurred from a variety of hypothetical disaster scenarios,
using consistent and appropriate methods and assumptions.

‘+ AmTrust’s property insurance portfolio is protected by AmTrust's property catastrophe excess of
loss treaty attaching at $70m.

‘+ Climate change financial stress is considered in the Company's ORSA report. The hurricane
exceedance probability curve was adjusted to reflect climate change by increasing the frequency
of hurricane Category 3 events by 15%, Category 4 events by 25%, Category 5 events by 35%,
and increasing storm surge ground up losses by 35%. The post-stress Universal Best's Capital
‘Adequacy Ratio (""BCAR’) is used to assess capital adequacy on a group level. The group's capital
risk appetite is to maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99"" percentile, which
results in a BCAR assessment of “Adequate”. The resulting net loss as measured by the 1:200-
year PML did not have a significant effect on the Company's capital due to the limit of catastrophe
reinsurance purchased.

‘+ No attempt has been made at this time to identify and measure a climate scenario equivalent to
two-degrees of Celsius.

‘+ The Exposure Management function within ERM works closely with the underwriting, actuarial
pricing and ceded reinsurance teams to inform of the adequacy of AmTrust's reinsurance
purchasing as compared to the risk appetites

‘+ The Company's insurance contracts are renewable annually, which would enable the Company to
quickly respond to changes as needed by adjusting its pricing or by restricting its exposure.

‘+ AmTrust’s preference for small risks provides a natural diversification against climate change
catastrophe due to the spread of the risks within and between geographic regions.

‘+ AmTrust manages its coastal wind exposures based on state-specific eligibility criteria reflecting
the building's distance to the coast, construction, as well as the age and condition of the roof.
Underwriting actions have reduced coastal exposures in Florida and along the Gulf Coast to further
mitigate large hurricane events.

‘+ To mitigate its exposure to extreme weather events in hail-prone areas, AmTrust maintains
eligibility requirements on an assessment of the insured vulnerability to damaging hail hazard, plus
the building's characteristics, such as a building's roof area, covering materials, and equipment e.g
HVAC or solar panels,

‘+ Corrective pricing and underwriting measures in Property Northeast have limited exposure growth
to reduce property catastrophe aggregation risk.

Investment Valuations -

The value of the types of financial instruments in which the Company is invested could be significantly
impacted if the market develops a perception that the issuer is either not adequately managing its climate
change risk or is accumulating a competitive disadvantage by not adapting its business strategy.

Mitigants:

‘+ AmTrust has analyzed its investment portfolio to determine the concentration of fossil fuel
investments, as well as other carbon related investments. The Company's fossil fuel investments
comprise less than 10% of its overall group-wide investment portfolio

‘+ The investment portfolio consists of readily marketable investment-grade fixed-income securities
with relatively short duration. As such, climate change risk on the Company's investment portfolio
is currently low due to any impact taking place over a longer time horizon than the average duration
of the portfolio. The Company's corporate bond portfolio is well diversified by sector and issuer and

+ Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer's general enterprise-
risk management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks,
including which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what
timeframes are considered.
+ Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments,
including which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.
The potential impact to AmTrust’s underwriting portfolio from the increased physical risk potential due to
climate fluctuations are as follows:

‘+ In Coastal areas along the U.S. Eastem coast and Gulf Coast, the potential of climate
fluctuations has a higher hurricane, tropical, extra tropical or noreaster storm event frequency
and severity, which could increase policyholder losses for personal and commercial property
and commercial auto coverages.

‘+ InNon-coastal areas, the potential risk of climate fluctuations is increased convective storm
events or severe weather (winds/derecho/straight-line, hail, flood, tornado, lightning, single day
adverse precipitation event, etc.) causing frequency and severity, which could increase losses
for personal and commercial property and commercial auto coverages. This could result in
higher policyholder losses in any area within the United States, but is at an increased level in

ey! 12

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
states where AmTrust currently has exposure, such as Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Louisiana.

‘+ Apotential risk of climate fluctuations is an increased frequency and severity of wildfire events,
which could increase policyholder losses for commercial property and auto coverages.

‘+ A potential risk of climate fluctuations is increased groundwater withdrawal and drought leading
to land subsidence issues, both inland and coastal, which could increase losses for commercial
property coverages in the lower Midwest and Southeastern states.

+ Reinsurance could become more expensive and scarce if climate induced events become more
frequent and severe.

‘+ AmTrust utilizes industry specific CAT predictive modelling, concentration monitoring tools and
risk management solutions to manage its exposure to climate fluctuations and impacts including
adjusting its guidelines and reinsurance retentions accordingly.

A. Describe the insurers’ processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment is in place and embedded in the ERM process.
The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee comprised of the Group CRO, International CRO, US
Head of Risk and other members of the ERM function. This committee, through the engagement of
management and other research, identifies new and changing risks to the business, tracks their
development and assesses the risk they pose to the Company. These risks are highlighted in the quarterly
ERM report and shared with the Risk Committee.
ERM's Exposure Management Team regularly performs detailed analysis of the property and workers’
‘compensation insurance portfolios. On a quarterly basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures
are monitored using the Verisk/AIR models, with separate modeling for the perils of hurricane, convective
storm, winter storm and wildfire. Hurricane modelled results are based on the warm sea surface
temperature catalogue, which recognize the near/medium term view on sea temperatures and capture the
increased frequency and severity of hurricanes experienced in these warmer periods.
B. Describe the insurer's processes for managing climate-related risks.
AmTrust has a limited appetite for risks exposed to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, storm
surge, inland flooding or wildfires. The Company manages its exposure to adverse weather risks through
disciplined underwriting in its risk selection, pricing, deductibles, loss control, and risk transfer. AmTrust
considers extreme weather events in pricing and underwriting its insurance products. To determine the
premium associated with the costs of these extreme events AmTrust relies on historical storm data, as well
as utilizing catastrophe models to supplement this historical data due to the infrequent nature of extreme
weather events
AmTrust manages its coastal wind exposures based on state-specific eligibility criteria reflecting the
building's distance to the coast, construction, as well as the age and condition of the roof. To mitigate its
exposure to extreme weather events in hail-prone areas, the Company maintains eligibility requirements
on an assessment of the insured vulnerability to damaging hail hazard, plus the building's characteristics,
such as a building's roof area, covering materials, and equipment e.g. HVAC or solar panels. AmTrust
utilizes catastrophe models to manage its portfolio's probable maximum losses to these types of extreme
events.
AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year catastrophe PML
be protected by reinsurance purchases for property and workers’ compensation, respectively. The
modelled 1:250-year catastrophe PML for property and workers’ compensation are monitored against
approved risk appetites. In addition, the Company runs Lloyd's Realistic Disaster Scenarios to estimate the
potential losses incurred from a variety of hypothetical disaster scenarios, using consistent and appropriate
methods and assumptions, which allow for the recognition of exposure changes in various geographic areas.
Climate change financial stress is considered annually in the Company's ORSA report. The hurricane
exceedance probability curve was adjusted to reflect climate change by increasing the frequency of
hurricane Category 3 events by 15%, Category 4 events by 25%, Category 5 events by 35%, and
increasing storm surge ground up losses by 35%. The post-stress Universal Best's Capital Adequacy
Ratio (BCAR) is used to assess capital adequacy on a group level. AmTrust's capital risk appetite is to
ey! 13

AFSI-—NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey 2024
maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99"" percentile which results in a BCAR
assessment of “Adequate”. The 1:200-year PML with the aforementioned adjustments for climate change
did not result in a significant stress to the Company's capital due to the level of reinsurance coverage in
place
The Exposure Management Team works closely with the underwriting, actuarial pricing and ceded
reinsurance teams to inform AmTrust's reinsurance purchasing.
Management of climate-related risks is incorporated into the Company's risk function. The Company is
conducting a core risk assessment and developing a Climate Change Financial Risk Framework (‘the
Framework""). The Framework will be used to monitor exposure to climate change and how it could impact
the resilience of the Company's financial and physical operations.
The Company will consider including additional stress scenarios that simulate potential impacts relating to
climate risks into its ORSA process. Additionally, the Company uses data from the scientific community
and resources provided by the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures to advise its risk
team and keep up to date of potential consequences or opportunities of climate-related impacts that it
incorporates into its risk assessment. This will support strategic decision making by providing
management and the board with a deeper understanding of the impact of a given climate scenario on its
chosen business model and strategy. This is an important step to embed the Framework into the
Company's strategy, governance, and decision-making process.
C. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are
integrated into the insurer's overall risk management.
The process of climate risk identification and assessment is in place and embedded in the general ERM
process. The Company has an Emerging Risk Committee, which identifies new and changing risks to the
business. The ERM function is responsible for monitoring climate-related risks that impact the
‘Company's insurance business. The Company's Global Chief Risk Officer provides to the Company's
Audit Committee an ERM report each quarter, a portion of which is dedicated to climate risks.
‘AmTrust considers climate change risk factors in its investment and underwriting practices, as mentioned
previously in Risk Management, Sections A and B, and Strategy, Section B, above.

The Exposure Management Team works closely with the underwriting, actuarial pricing and also the ceded

reinsurance team to inform AmTrust's reinsurance purchasing.

A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in

line with its strategy and risk management process.

The Company maintains catastrophe risk appetites that are currently defined based on the modelled 1:250-

year catastrophe PMLs (per occurrence). Management monitors that these loss events are protected by

adequate reinsurance structures. Exposure to these events is regularly simulated for the property and

workers’ compensation portfolios. AFSI compares the reinsurance limits and the simulated PML from

realistic disaster scenarios, and also the net loss resulting from a 1:250 year hurricane event as a ratio to

surplus.

‘The Company has started to measure its 2023 Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (""GHG"") emissions

in 2024. Most of AmTrust's Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions come from office activity and company-

‘owned/controlled mobile combustion sources. The Company has not set any GHG emissions reduction

targets but plans on developing strategies to mitigate emissions.

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and

the related risks.

The Company is beginning to measure its baseline Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. AmTrust

aims to partner with a third party to measure and validate its emissions and plans to disclose next year.

C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and

performance against targets.

‘AmTrust's catastrophe risk appetite states that the modelled per occurrence 1:250-year catastrophe

PMLs be protected by reinsurance purchases for property and workers’ compensation, respectively. On

a quarterly basis, the modelled 1:250 year catastrophe PMLs for property and workers’ compensation are

monitored against this target. AmTrust's catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance purchases annually

correspond to the 1:250-year hurricane PML.

INTRODUCTION
Founded in 1894, in response to a fire that destroyed a number of businesses, West Bend has been
apillar of the community for 130 years. Our core values of excellence, integrity, and responsibility
drive our commitment to our associates, agency partners, policyholders, and neighbors, and these
values shine through in everything we do. Strong environmental, social, and governance practices
have been at the heart of who we are and what we do fora long time, and we're committed to
expanding these efforts.
As a mutual insurance group, we base decisions based on what's best for our agents, insureds, and
associates for the long term. Our strategy is rooted in creating a robust property and casualty
product and service portfolio. The diversification strategy, combined with our risk management
practices, helps protect our liquidity and build overall financial stability. We recognize the theme
of climate change, and the unpredictable impact that weather related events can have on our
business. West Bend is dedicated to considering the theme of climate change as we assess risk
within the enterprise and make business decisions.
West Bend submits the NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey below in alignment with the
recommendations outlined by the Financial Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
GOVERNANCE

Governance - Narrative
Oversight is critical to the management of the company and protection of our culture. West Bend
has a strong corporate governance structure that supports regulatory compliance and ethical
interactions with our internal and external relationships.
West Bend Insurance Company (West Bend) utilizes a tightly integrated Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) program to ensure our largest risks are identified and managed to an
acceptable outcome. Periodic and regular risk identification sessions are performed so that we can
identify risks with potentially significant consequences and appropriately assess, manage, and
govern based on the risk materiality. The theme of climate change is considered as we assess risk
within the enterprise and make business decisions.
The governance structure at West Bend is comprised of members of the Risk Management Office
(Chief Risk Officer and Director — ERM), Division Heads (Officer or Director positions), an internal
ERM Associate Board (Directors and Officers), Sr. Executives and a sub-committee of the board of
directors (Strategic Risk Oversight Committee). The ERM Associate Board and the Strategic Risk
Oversight Committee both meet quarterly. The roles and responsibilities of all participants are
clearly identified. Criteria have been established and documented which clearly dictate the level
of the governance structure to which risks, exposures and controls need to be communicated and
at which level they are managed. In general, the larger the inherent exposure, the higher in the
governance structure to which the risk is reported and the higher the level at which the risk is
managed.

STRATEGY
Strategy — Narrative
Our most significant climate change exposure over the short, medium, and long term relates to.
the frequency and severity of property losses. Considering our concentration of property
exposure in the Midwest, convective storm experience will drive future results. If climate
change results in increased frequency and severity over time, this experience will be
incorporated into our underwriting, pricing, and claims processes, providing an ongoing
adaptation and mitigation to the risk exposures. Despite our Midwest concentration, our
strategy of creating a robust property and casualty product and service portfolio remains strong
and intact. This is further evidenced through our financial strength assessed by A.M. Best
Company, recognized worldwide as the benchmark for assessing insurers' financial strength and
our liquidity and capital adequacy in our Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA), filed with the
Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (QC!).
West Bend has identified the following major climate risk areas and related mitigation
strategies.
Carbon Emissions
- Risk Assessment: Low - The insurance industry is a low emitter.
- Mitigation: Not applicable.
Investments
- Risk Assessment: Low to medium — This risk is systemic in nature which does not
uniquely expose our portfolio.
- Mitigation: Our investment managers consider several factors within our investment
portfolio, including climate.
Underwriting/Property Catastrophe
- Risk Assessment: Medium to high — This risk is a primary focus and correlates directly
with our business.
- Mitigation: West Bend avoids long term property catastrophe exposure by writing 12-
4

month policies. This allows us the ability to annually modify pricing and terms to reflect
the current environment. Additionally, we continuously monitor changes and trends and
purchase reinsurance to transfer risk where available and practical.
Additionally, there are two risks in our Enterprise Risk Management portfolio directly linked to
climate change.

- Severe weather or other property catastrophe (wildfire, explosion, terrorism, etc.) from
a single event could cause damage to or destruction of property we insure.

- Multiple severe weather or other property catastrophe events (wildfire, explosion,
terrorism, etc.) could cause damage to, or destruction of, property we insure and result
in retained losses greater than anticipated. This risk contemplates that changing weather
patterns could result in more frequent, less severe losses for property that we insure.

Strategy - Closed Ended Questions
* Has the insurer taken steps to engage key constituencies on the topic of climate
risk and resiliency? No
* Does the insurer provide products or services to support the transition to alow
carbon economy or help customers adapt to climate risk? Yes
‘* Does the insurer make investments to support the transition to a lowcarbon
economy? No
* Does the insurer have a plan to assess, reduce or mitigate its greenhouse gas
emissions in its operations or organizations? No
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Management - Narrative
‘As mentioned, West Bend utilizes a tightly integrated Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program
to ensure our largest risks are identified and managed to an acceptable outcome. Periodic and
regular risk identification sessions are performed so that we can identify risks with potentially
significant consequences and appropriately assess, manage, and govern based on the risk
materiality. The theme of climate change is considered as we assess risk within the enterprise and
make business decisions.
Current weather catastrophe modeling has not been able to accurately predict the impact of
climate change on Midwest severe convective storms. While we cannot predict how our property
catastrophe experience will change over time, we have assessed and addressed our liquidity and
capital adequacy in our Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA), filed with the Wisconsin Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI). Our ORSA contains a detailed discussion of our risk
management plans related to liquidity, capital adequacy, and property catastrophe exposure. On
an annual basis we meet with our regulator at Wisconsin OCI for an open and detailed dialogue on
these topics. We believe that both liquidity and capital adequacy are sufficient to withstand highly
improbable loss years.
5

While West Bend does not have a separate dedicated climate change policy within our investment
portfolio, we utilize outside professional investment managers to balance investment risks across a
wide array of risk factors and a diverse portfolio to optimize results within the constraints we
provide them. No changes to the strategy have been made at this time.

METRICS AND TARGETS
Metrics and Targets — Narrative
West Bend does not utilize climate-related metrics and targets to manage risks and opportunities,
but instead approaches all risks through the lens of our risk tolerance and risk appetite as outlined
within our Enterprise Risk Management program. We are focused on our liquidity and capital
adequacy, which is described in great detail within our Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA), filed
with the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI). Our ORSA contains a detailed
discussion of our risk management plans related to liquidity, capital adequacy, and property
catastrophe exposure. We believe that both liquidity and capital adequacy are sufficient to
withstand highly improbable loss years.
West Bend utilizes computer modeling as an input in our decisions to purchase property
catastrophe reinsurance, our main financial mitigant, and to help us understand accumulations of
property exposure. These models illustrate various peril simulations across our book of business
and produce a range of potential outcomes.
West Bend does not track Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 emissions. While we do not track our
scope 1 emissions, our current operations consider efficiency and reduced emissions. Our primary
sources of emissions include heating our company office spaces, operating company vehicles and
the generation of electricity used at our offices. Several investments and initiatives have been
6

undertaken to reduce overall use, and thus emissions. Our facilities were designed with superior
utility performance in mind, and we employ heat action days designed to reduce our consumption
of electricity on hot days. High R value insulation and advanced HVAC controls and equipment also
contribute to keeping our cooling and heating utility consumption low. Continued advancements
in LED lighting, variable frequency motor drives (VF), and building automation technology have
allowed us to further invest in energy efficiency. Internally, low-flow plumbing fixtures, hands-free
faucets, and high-efficiency appliances have been installed to help reduce water use. Externally,
rain sensors and drip irrigation reduce water consumption. Additionally, storm water management
is structured to minimize runoff from the property to minimize our impact.
In addition to reducing utility usage, our main campus is designed with sustainability in
mind. West Bend employs a robust recycling practice, not only for company-used products, but
also assisting associates with recycling personal items. Companywide, we recycle paper,
cardboard, metals, glass, and plastic. In 2023, we recycled approximately 9,000 cubic yards of co-
mingled waste. Water bottle fillers have been installed throughout, saving thousands of disposable
water bottles from the landfill. Additionally, we offer recycling services to our associates for ink
cartridges, batteries, cell phones, and eyeglasses.
Our corporate headquarters was constructed in 1991 with the intention of restoring the grounds
to their natural ecosystem. The building sits on 160 acres of land, for which only four are
manicured turf. The approximately 140 acres of prairie protect wildlife, reduce soil erosion and
degradation, and minimize water and chemical use, as no extra watering or fertilization is needed
for its plants to thrive. As an associate benefit, we offer onsite garden plots available for use
throughout the growing season. The garden and bed waste are composted onsite and reused in
the gardens and around the campus.
Our prairie serves as a habitat to lots of natural wildlife, including deer, turkeys, foxes, pheasants,
geese, ducks, hummingbirds, and many other varieties of birds. Throughout Wisconsin, the
populations of many of these creatures have declined due to the loss of habitat. West Bend
consulted with experts to determine the best design and construction, ensuring the prairie could
support a variety of threatened and endangered species native to this area. Aligning with our goal
of supporting and maintaining wildlife, we regularly release pheasants into the prairie in an effort
to build the resident population and provide a safe, natural home to them. We also work with a
local beekeeper that houses 4 — 6 beehives each year on our grounds. To learn more about ESG at
West Bend see our web site: https://www.thesilverlining.com/

Response to Governance
William Penn Life Insurance Company of New York is a subsidiary of Banner Life Insurance Company and Banner
Life Insurance Company is a subsidiary of Legal & General America Inc. Banner Life Insurance Company
underwrites and issues insurance policies and retirement products under the Legal & General America (LGA)
umbrella. Our parent company, Legal & General Group Plc (“Group”), is headquartered in London and provides
protection and retirement solutions as well as offers investment management services. L&G Group have a
mature policy, strategy and framework for governance related to the financial risks posed by climate change.
Addressing climate change is one of Legal & General's strategic growth drivers. The three pillars of the climate
strategy are: Invest, Influence, and Operate; driving positive change throughout the entire global organization.
Invest ~ through reducing the intensity of our financed emissions and through investing in the transition.
Influence ~ through the products that we offer and through our engagement with companies, governments
and policymakers.
Operate ~ through our operations and the businesses we control.
‘The 2023 L&G Group Climate and Nature Report is in line with the recommendations made by the Task Force
on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD).
Environmental management is central to Group's commercial success. Accountability for building a sustainable
business is shared across the business and supported by governance that is led by our Board. The L&G group
Board (‘the Board’) is ultimately accountable for the long-term stewardship of the group. Responding to climate
change and addressing nature-loss and the opportunities and risks associated these issues are of significant
importance to the Board. The Board received regular updates on the group's strategic approach and progress
on climate matters, highlighting areas of opportunity and challenge.

Confidential
The Group Risk Committee (GRC) oversees the risks associated with climate change to ensure exposures are
controlled in line with the group's risk appetite, and ensures that management actions are also aligned.
Alongside regular updates on the risks associated with climate change, the committee receives regular climate-
specific management information.
During 2023, L&G Group transitioned to a new Group Climate Change Director, with responsibility for
coordinating the Group’s response to climate change and incorporating nature and biodiversity risks. The role
has the senior manager responsibility of ensuring that an appropriate strategy is in place to understand,
identify, measure, monitor, control and report risks from climate change in line with the risk strategy and risk
appetite parameters set by the Board. The Board, through the GRC, Executive Risk Committee (ERC) and Group
Management Committee (GMC) has delegated oversight of the management of the risks associated with
climate change to the Group Environment Committee (GEC).
‘The GEC is chaired by the Group Climate Change Director and includes senior level members of the Group’s
management team. This Committee is responsible for providing strategic direction of the Group's
environmental response, including to climate change, with reference to the Group's broader strategy.to the
management of environmental impact on the group, with a particular focus on the delivery of our strategic
response to climate change. The Group Environment Committee has clearly defined relationships with other
Group oversight committees to ensure a consistent group-wide approach and to support how we are
implementing our ambitious strategy.
The Divisional CEO’s ensure climate risk is embedded within their respective divisions. They are the ultimate
owners of the risk, responsible for identifying, managing and monitoring climate related risks within the risk
appetites agreed at the GEC.
Locally, Legal & General America (LGA) leverages the Group's risk management framework and has its own
Climate Risk Committee which has been a sub-committee of the LGA Board since May 2023. The primary role of
the LGA Climate Risk Committee is to ensure that adequate governance and oversight is in place for the
assessment and management of the financial risks associated with climate change. The LGA Climate Risk
Committee includes LGA Executive sponsorship and representatives from both the Protection and Pension Risk
Transfer businesses. A representative from the Group Climate team serves on this Committee in an advisory
capacity.
The principal duties of the LGA Climate Risk Committee include:

‘© Integrate Group Climate Policy principles into LGA’s governance frameworks, risk management processes,
and business strategies.

‘© Steer the development of a LGA written risk policy and set risk tolerance and risk limits for financial risks
associated with climate change.

‘© Monitor regulatory guidance and develop additional actions based on regulatory requirements as they
become available and are applicable to LGA.

‘© Oversee the creation of a mechanism for disclosing climate risks to appropriate regulatory authorities.

‘* Monitor appropriate climate risk related reporting on behalf of the LGA Board and provide periodic updates
to the LGA Board as needed.

‘© Ensure that an appropriate strategy is in place to understand, identify, measure, monitor, control and
report risks from climate change in line with the risk strategy and risk appetite parameters set by the Group

Response to Strategy
L&G Group believes that addressing climate change is the right thing to do, not just for the sake of our business
but for the many different stakeholder groups our business impacts. Our climate transition plan is clear that
addressing climate change must be pursued in tandem with halting nature and biodiversity loss, During 2023, it
was increasingly recognized globally the impacts and dependencies our economies have on nature. Group
welcomed the release of the TEND recommendations during 2023 and have taken first steps in their adoption.
L&G Group's investment approach seeks to mitigate the risks from climate change through reducing the
intensity of our financed emissions, while maximizing our impact by directing our investments toward the
transition. We aim to take a similar approach to nature-based risks. L&G Group's investment strategy is
constructed to manage short and long-term responsibilities to both our policyholders and our shareholders, in
line with applicable regulations. As a long-dated investor, particularly in bond investments, our decarbonization
approach involves transitioning to lower-carbon investments through our new business flows, and managing
the phase-out of higher-carbon investments within our legacy holdings.
In the short to medium term, we prefer to focus our efforts on credible reductions to our carbon footprint
across all sectors and encourage others to do the same. In addition, our commitments around deforestation are
aimed at protecting existing carbon sinks. In the long-term we expect negative emissions, such as through
nature based solutions, to play a critical role in balancing out residual emissions to achieving net zero.
Our short-term horizon looks at a three-year period. Our medium-term horizon looks forward up to 10 years.
Our long-term horizon looks at the time horizon up to 2050. This strives to challenge and shape the very core of
our business as well as the overall strategy.

Confidential
While the risks from climate change and nature-loss are increasingly evident, the transition to net zero and the
reallocation of capital to nature-positive outcomes also creates opportunities such as investing in the
technology and infrastructure needed to transition away from carbon emissions, such as renewable energy
sources, low-carbon properties, low-carbon heating, electrification of transport and nature-based solutions.
On the other hand, investments in sectors or companies which are adversely exposed to a transitioning
economy could lose value or are downgraded, and investments prove ineffective resulting in loss.
Given the importance of bonds within our portfolio, we first consider the impacts of climate risks on the credit
quality and sector breakdown of our portfolio. We are primarily a long-dated ‘buy-and-hold’ bond investor,
managing our portfolio to match our short and long-term payments to retirement customers. Our balance
sheet and cashflow matching is therefore more impacted by bond downgrades and defaults than movements in
bond value.
We model four climate pathways.
1) In the Inaction scenario, global failure to act on climate change means emissions continue to grow at
historical rates and approximate global warming by 2100 is 3 - 4°C.
2) Inthe below 2°C scenario, immediate, ambitious policy and investment action to address climate
change limits global warming to below 2°C, but warming most likely exceeds 1.5°C.
3) Inthe Net Zero 1.5°C scenario, immediate, highly ambitious action to address climate change leads to a
reduction in emissions to net zero around 2050.
4) Inthe delayed Below 2°C scenario, Policy and investment action to limit warming to well below 2°C is
delayed to 2030, resulting in much more disruptive change and warming will most likely exceed 1.5°C.
The Delayed Below 2°C scenario remains the most economically disruptive of our climate scenarios.
Legal & General America (LGA) aligns our climate risk strategy to that of our parent company. Climate risks,
both physical and transition risks, are most relevant to LGA’s investment strategy and a framework has been
developed to identify and escalate these risks.
LGA’s portfolio is primarily (97.5%) investment-grade (rated BBB and above). Of this, BBB-rated bonds, which
carry the greatest credit transition risk, comprise 33.4% of the portfolio, and of those, the ones from the high
carbon sectors (defined as energy, utilities, materials and industrials) only comprise 11.4% of the portfolio.
Banner Life Insurance Company (a subsidiary of Legal & General America, Inc.) has taken the following steps to
engage key constituencies on the topic of climate change.
Our Underwriting department has successfully implemented a tele-commuting policy which allows our
underwriters to work from home. Currently, 100% of underwriters participate in this initiative. There is an
expected reduction in pollution and gas consumption as travel between home and office is not necessary. An
added benefit is the ability to attract top talent throughout the country. Our AppAssist function has had a tele-
commuting policy for many years and 100% of interview representatives work remotely. Following COVID,
other areas within the Company have increased their remote workforce reducing the number of people
physically coming into the office. Home Office employees are working in a hybrid, office-based approach which
allows them to work on average two (2) days at home each week.
LGA transitioned to a digital application journey, in states where approved, which significantly reduces the use
of paper in the process. Our agent commission statements are delivered electronically rather than by mail and
we encourage electronic delivery of our newly issued policies. We continue to add functionality to our
customer website and agent portal to service customers in an electronic (paperless) fashion. The Operations
team is exploring additional ways to reduce the use of paper as part of the life insurance process.

Response to Risk Management
LGA’s risk management of climate risks is aligned with our parent company. As an enterprise, L&G Group have
integrated climate risk management into the existing risk and governance framework and have carried out a
detailed assessment of how we could expect climate risk to emerge across our business model. Climate change
risks will emerge through our current risk exposures and the relevant Group policies set out our approaches to
identifying, assessing and managing these risks. The purpose of the L&G Group Environment Risk Policy is to
set out the principles for managing our business so as to align with the mitigation of environmental risks and to
be resilient to the risk of different climate outcomes.

Confidential
The risks arising from climate change that we are exposed to fall into three broad categories:
1) Transition risks ~ impacts on asset valuation and the economy from the process of transitioning
‘towards a low-carbon economy
2) Physical risks ~ Impacts on asset holdings or changes to insurance liabilities as a result of more
frequent and severe weather events and longer term shifts in climate
3) Corporate risks ~ Impacts on the Group from exposure to regulatory censure, climate related
litigation risks or adverse customer perception of the Group. This may be through loss of franchise
value, directly through fines or costs due to adverse investor sentiment resulting from poor
alignment with ESG rating expectations.
‘As much of our balance sheet is based on assumptions and expectations of future experience, risks can
materialize through both actual change in experienced profits or losses, as well as changes in those future
expectations.
As a life insurance company, we are most concerned about the effects of climate change on mortality and
longevity. Climate change could lead to changes in how long people are expected to live. Changes to these
expectations will emerge gradually as the effects are experienced or through increased certainty around future
climate pathways and the associated health impacts. As a result, impacts on mortality and longevity
assumptions may materialize over time.
Climate change may impact credit risk both through movements in credit spreads and through credit rating
transitions, as a result of changes in either actual or anticipated default rates. It may also impact asset values
due to a (potentially sudden) repricing to reflect transition risks to a low or carbon-neutral economy, or due to.
more frequent and severe weather events and longer-term shifts in climate impacting asset values. These may
be through actual experience or a change in anticipated future experience. Climate change may also present
enhanced asset returns, such as increased equity valuation for a firm enabling the transition to a low-carbon
economy. Climate change may impact other market risk exposures through movements in macroeconomic
factors such as interest, inflation and foreign exchange rates.
Our commitments assume that governments will implement required policy changes; the firms we invest in will
deliver their targets; and, there will be societal change on an unprecedented scale over the next decade. These
external events may impact our ability to deliver against our climate commitments.
The markets in which we operate are highly regulated. The regulatory approach to climate will continue to
evolve. New or evolving interpretations of compliance expectations require changes to our products or
business processes. A breach of legislative or regulatory requirements may expose us to financial penalties,
remediation costs or damage to our reputation.
When assessing materiality, we consider both how the group is affected by climate change, as well as the
group’s own impact on the climate.
The effect of future uncertainty over climate change pathways is that the evaluation of climate-related risks
and impacts has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes
greater than our materiality for the group's financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that
amount.
Our scenario modelling enables us to assess how the impacts from climate change may emerge under a range
of climate scenarios and time horizons. Given our business model, we assess the most material financial risks
from the potential impact of climate change on the value and credit rating of our assets.
Climate transition risks are primarily measured in relation to our carbon exposures. We are committed to
reducing the carbon footprint of both our operations (scope 1 and 2) and of our group balance sheet portfolio’s
GHG emissions intensity to align with the ‘Paris’ 1.5°C objective. We measure the contribution of our

Confidential
investments to CO:e emissions, calculating portfolio economic carbon emission intensities at both group and
divisional level.

‘As discussed in the Strategy section, we model four climate pathways.
1) Inthe Inaction scenario, global failure to act on climate change means emissions continue to grow at
historical rates and global warming is 3 - 4 °C.
2) Inthe below 2°C scenario, immediate, ambitious policy and investment action to address climate change
limits global warming to below 2°C, but warming most likely exceeds 1.5°C.
3) Inthe Net Zero 1.5°C scenario, immediate, highly ambitious action to address climate change leads to a
reduction in CO: emissions to net zero around 2050.
4) In the delayed Below 2°C scenario, Policy and investment action to limit warming to well below 2°C is
delayed to 2030, resulting in much more disruptive change and warming will most likely exceed 1.5°C.
We deploy a range of management actions to meet our risk management objectives. We established a
framework for climate commitments, which accounts for all GHGs, and covers scope 1,2, and material scope 3
emissions. Our progress and long-term goals are supported by annual and interim targets to enable regular
monitoring of progress towards the commitment. Progress is reviewed and reported on at least annually and
overseen by the GEC. Our commitments are consistent with the latest science, and are credible and achievable.
Our risk management approach recognizes the importance of engagement with investee companies. Our
Investment Management Agreements (IMAs) with asset managers, have climate-specific exclusions that focus
on key areas of transition risk: CIP exclusions, coal and oil sand activity and deforestation. We also take account
of the broader energy system within our portfolio management approach — through our high carbon escalation
process on an individual basis.
LGA also measures the impact of climate risk on real assets, e.g. commercial mortgage loans. For this analysis,
we utilize a vendor based tool that currently has the ability of analyzing the potential impact of hurricane/storm
surge, flood and wildfire perils. The tool employs the use of proprietary data and algorithms that create risk
ratings derived from value at risk calculations that are native to the tool. These risk ratings enable LGA to
evaluate the impact of climate risk on our back book real assets and consequently manage concentration risk in
climate risk prone areas. Additionally, we use the tool to evaluate real asset investment opportunities to ensure
new investments in real assets fall within our climate risk appetite.

Response to Metrics and Targets
Across L&G Group, we monitor and assess our climate-related risks and opportunities using three key metrics:
1) operational carbon footprint, 2) GHG emissions intensity of our investments, and 3) implied portfolio
‘temperature alignment.
The operational carbon footprint covers the operations we directly control, such as the energy from our core
occupied offices, landlord activities and our housebuilding, as well as the construction of new homes. Our
target is to be net zero by 2050 with our occupied offices and business travel operating with net zero emissions
from 2030.
GHG emissions intensity of our investments. Our financed emissions, generated within our investment
portfolios and classified as scope 3 creates the largest contribution to our carbon footprint. We have
implemented targets that support our commitment to align with a 1.5 C “Paris objective. The primary metric is
the GHG economic emissions intensity of the portfolio of Group proprietary assets. This is the total of all the
GHG produced by their share of the companies and corporations that they invest in, per unit of investment, and
is reported using carbon dioxide equivalent (COze) emission data.
There are three components to this metric: 1) the GHG emissions for each entity in which they are invested, 2)
EVIC (enterprise value including cash) to normalize the emissions by the underlying size of the entity, and 3) the
size of their holding in the entity. While Group remains ahead of their year-end 2023 target reduction from
2019, we may still see further volatility from changes in the global economy. Changes in the emissions coming
from our investments and our investment activity are key to decarbonizing our portfolios in the medium and
longer term. However, in the short term, factors outside of our control, such as carbon outcomes of the entity,
market movements and the lag in the reporting of the underlying emissions data have the potential to create
significant volatility in the calculated metrics.
The Implied portfolio temperature alignment metric is used to measure and manage investment impact.. The
metric describes the climate transition pathway (temperature scenario) each company is expected to align to,
based on both historical decarbonization trends and targets the company has set. It reflects the direct link
between global carbon emissions and the likely severity of global warming and allows investors to measure
their impact on climate change and evaluate their performance relative to SBTS.
Targets have been established at L&G Group level, with Legal & General America supplying relevant
information for Group to measure and manage its overall performance with respect to these metrics. Because
the metrics are currently aggregated at a Group level, metrics are not available for LGA standalone at this time.
As part of the group we also comply with existing policies around restrictions on investments in coal and certain
other types of carbon intensive energy projects, which help us overall manage carbon intensity of our balance
sheet and transition risk inherent in these assets.

climate-related financial risks.
B. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Company Response:
With oversight by the full Board of Directors, the Company's management personnel has integrated the assessment of
climate-related risks and opportunities into the Company's risk management discussions as part of the Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) program to ensure the largest risks are identified and appropriate addressed. The Company has
not issued a public statement on its climate policy, however, remains actively engaged in climate-related discussions
with business partners. Executive management is heavily involved in day-to-day operations and therefore is
responsible for monitoring operational risk management strategies, so they are in alignment with the Company's
overall risk strategy.
All departments are represented and involved in reviewing risks on a regular basis within the organization. Ata
minimum, executive management will review annually, but more frequently as changes occur that could require a
reassessment of our philosophy.

* Discuss if and how the insurer makes investments to support the transition to a low carbon
economy.
C. Describe the resilience of the insurer's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related
scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario.
Company Response:
‘Asa property & casualty insurer, focused in the upper Midwest, climate-related risks and opportunities have a direct
impact on the Company's strategy and financial results. Considering our concentration of property exposures is in
Wisconsin and Minnesota, the frequency and severity of property losses over the short, medium, and longer term from
severe convective storms (SCS) will continue to drive future results and shape management decision making. Executive
management continually assesses and manages the performance, including but not limited to, operating performance
by line of business and territory. If climate changes impact the frequency and/or severity over time as we have seen in
recent years, this experience will be incorporated into risk management and underwriting strategies.
The financial results are reviewed monthly by management and both financial and operational updates are reviewed
with the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
‘The Company's ERM program has identified key risks linked to climate change. First, severe weather or another
property catastrophe event (i.e. fire) could directly affect the home office building and operations. Second, a single or
multiple severe weather events could cause significant damage to properties we insure and could result in retained
losses greater than anticipated. To address these risks, the Company currently purchases property catastrophe
reinsurance around the 1-in-250 year single event, as well as reinsurance on a per-risk basis. The overall objective of
purchasing reinsurance is to manage the short-term impact, and possibly long-term, on the Company including a
reduction in surplus. Our risk management strategy includes discussion of liquidity, capital adequacy and how that
could be impacted by property catastrophe exposure.
There is no formal plan surrounding the Company's strategy for consideration of climate-related scenarios related to a
2 degree Celsius or lower scenario. On a more granular level in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint we flex remote
work to avoid long commutes, paperless billing and mailing when regulation allows, remote claims offices across the
state to promote less travel time from home offices, and use of technology to eliminate paper files. Further, we have
incorporated other components into our business model including an overall analysis with our investment portfolio and
the impact of ESG. In conjunction with oversight by our investment manager, the Company's portfolio has trended on
the lower side for an ESG score and was assigned a Medium risk score.

* Discuss whether climate-related risks are addressed through the insurer’s general enterprise-risk
management process or a separate process and how frequently the process is completed.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze its underwriting risks, including
which risk factors the scenarios consider, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes
are considered.
* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including
which risk factors are utilized, what types of scenarios are used, and what timeframes are
considered.
Company Response:
‘As discussed above, Company management has developed an ERM program to ensure our largest risks are identified
and managed. We recognize that climate-related risks are critical to our overall risk management strategy. Our
approach integrates these risks into our ERM framework, ensuring that they are assessed and managed alongside other
key risks.
Climate-related change is a component of those considerations during periodic meetings as we assess risk to the
Company, the significance of results, and how it could impact operating profitability. The Company continually reviews
underwriting guidelines to mitigate these risks and improve financial performance. Management and Underwriting
personnel meet monthly to discuss product or program restrictions as well as product features, including wind/hail
deductibles to address current market and environmental concerns. We employ both short-term (1-5 years) and long-
term (10-30 years) scenarios to assess potential impacts on property values and claims frequency. These scenarios are
developed using data from reputable climate models and include worst-case and best-case outcomes to provide a
comprehensive view of potential risks.
On an annual basis, management discusses the impact of climate change during the catastrophe modeling process with
our reinsurance broker. The modeling allows us to quantify the financial impact of potential catastrophic events. The
Company uses a blend of the Verisk and RMS models for reviewing property exposures. This modeling builds in
anticipated increases to storm frequency and severity, which may be impacted by climate change. In addition, the
modeling provides stress testing scenarios which factors in an increase in storm activity and losses to determine to
assess the impact on the Company's surplus.
‘The Company utilizes Asset Allocation Management (AAM) as our investment manager. Our investment policy, which is
approved by the Board of Directors, is shared with AAM as we rely on them to balance investment risks across a variety
of risk factors (asset allocation, credit quality, duration), to diversify the portfolio, optimize results and investment

returns within the guidelines of the policy. We do not have a separate dedicated climate change policy within our
investment portfolio. Market-related risk is stressed and capped at 10% of surplus under a 1-in-200 market event
scenario. AM incorporates ESG issues into their decision-making, but our portfolio is concentrated in the medium and
low risk categories and falls below the Bloomberg Int. Corp. risk score. 0% of holdings are classified as “Severe” and
under 10% are classified as “High”. The top 10 fixed income holdings with the highest ESG risk score represent less than
10% of total fixed income investments.

B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related
risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
* Asterisks represent questions derived from the original Climate Risk Disclosure Survey.
Company Response:
Wisconsin Mutual currently targets purchasing property catastrophe reinsurance at the 1-in-250 year single event. The
objective of our property catastrophe program is to remain below the retention level for any individual weather-related
event, and avoid the frequency of claims submitted to reinsurers. We historically have targeted a 10 yr return period,
however, that has been challenged lately due to both the severity of the weather event and the increasing loss costs
which have been driven higher by inflation. See “Risk Management” section above for additional details on catastrophe
modeling.
‘The Company does not measure or assess carbon emissions and greenhouse gas emissions or the impact on certain
lines of business or territories. As discussed above, our most significant risk related to climate change are the property
exposures and the related concentration of those risks and how our reinsurance program properly mitigates a material
financial impact.

STRATEGY RESPONSE:
Zenith is a national property-casualty insurer that is admitted in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Workers’
compensation and employer's liability insurance is our primary line of business. In addition to workers’
compensation and employer's liability insurance, Zenith also writes the following lines of insurance in California
for risks in the farm and agriculture industries: commercial auto, commercial general liability, commercial multi-
peril and commercial property.
We believe that an extended drought or significant flooding in California is an ongoing, climate-related risk with
potential adverse consequences for California agriculture. More than half of our California workers’ compensation
premium is derived from within the agricultural industry. Periodically, as needed to address any emerging risks, we
evaluate the impact of a stress scenario in which we lose 50% of our agriculture-based workers’ compensation
premiums due to drought or floods at the same time as competition reduces our writings elsewhere by 20%. The
last stress test scenario did not result in an adverse change in the company’s AM Best capital adequacy ratio, the
measure we use to assess capital adequacy. Zenith’s property lines of business are exposed to the variabilities of
climate change. The potential for natural disaster/weather-related perils is factored into pricing and underwriting
practices. Additionally, Zenith uses reinsurance to manages its climate change risks in its property business.
Overall, Zenith believes its short-term and mid-term climate-related risks to be manageable
Zenith engages its customers on climate-related risks in various ways. Potential workers’ compensation-related
impacts to customers from climate change influenced events are included in the extensive claims, medical, and
safety and health services which are provided to customers in mitigating their individual exposures. Zenith provides
numerous resources to its customers, including information on its website, publications, and on-site visits, and
identifies precautions that can be taken to avoid situations that can lead to occupational accidents and injuries.
Zenith presents the advantages of solar and wind power to assist in mitigating overall energy costs to its
commercial property-casualty customers. Zenith continuously investigates if a facility has exposure to weather-
related hazards. The importance of disaster planning and recovery programs is emphasized given its role in large
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, windstorms, tornadoes, floods, and wildfires. Zenith also provides
industry updates to its insureds on sustainability and practices relating to such areas as conservation and the
management of soil and water. This is especially relevant to its California agriculture policyholders. In addition, we
are active supporters of organizations such as the California Workers Compensation Institute, the Workers
Compensation Research Institute, the California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom, California Future
Farmers of America, California Fresh Fruit Association and the California Ag Leadership Foundation.
Regarding investments, environmental risk is viewed as a category of business risk, and it is part of the overall
decision-making process when assessing an investment. Zenith’s investment objectives are (a) to invest on a

long-term basis in accordance with applicable insurance regulatory guidelines; and (b) to ensure preservation of
invested capital for policyholder protection, always providing sufficient liquidity for the payment of claims and
other policy obligations. Investment guidelines require all investments to be made using the long-term value
investing approach by investing in securities of companies and other entities at prices below their underlying long-
term values to protect the Company's capital from loss and earn income over time and provide operating income
as needed. Environmental, social and governance issues have become factors in the investment analysis and
decision-making process. Deficiencies or excessive risk in these areas could lead to the rejection of investment
opportunities or the sale of existing positions. In some cases, climate change or other environmental issues will
bea risk to a business - perhaps as products are phased out, capital expenditures increase to comply with
stricter environmental laws, carbon taxes reduce demand, new technology creates substitutes for a company’s
high carbon footprint products, etc. A large proportion of our investment portfolio is held in short-term securities
or government bonds. These investment classes typically tend to have less exposure to environmental, social and
governance issues.

* Discuss the climate scenarios utilized by the insurer to analyze risks on its investments, including which risk

RISK MANAGEMENT RESPONSE:
Climate change exposure is incorporated into Zenith’s overall risk management policies. Zenith’s workers’
compensation insurance business is concentrated in California and Florida and Zenith’s commercial property and
casualty insurance business is entirely concentrated in California. California and Florida are states that are exposed
to climate and environmental changes, natural perils such as earthquake, hurricanes, floods and availability of
water supplies, along with the possibility of pandemics and terrorist acts. Accordingly, Zenith could suffer losses as
a result of catastrophic events in these states. Zenith’s catastrophe management strategies are designed to mitigate

its exposure. Through a combination of reinsurance, underwriting controls and careful tracking of exposures,
supported by technology, Zenith is focused on effectively managing risks.
For workers’ compensation insurance, Zenith carefully monitors the number of covered lives by zip code to avoid a
concentration of workers in any small geographic area. Zenith limits individual underwriters’ ability to insure any
risk with a significant number of covered lives. Over half of Zenith’s California workers’ compensation business is
in California agriculture, which by its nature does not have large number of workers in individual buildings, but could
be impacted by climate and environmental changes. Risk management for potential workers’ compensation-
related impacts to customers include extensive claims, medical, and safety and health services which are provided
to customers in mitigating their individual exposures. For commercial property and casualty insurance, Zenith
implements similar measures. Zenith carefully monitors property aggregation and proactively reaches out to
potentially affected insureds during ongoing catastrophes. Zenith limits individual underwriters’ authority and
proactively oversees catastrophe management. Zenith evaluates the effects of climate and climate change to
operations and facilities through loss control inspections.
In addition, Zenith purchases excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance up to $150 million for its workers’
compensation losses and excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance up to $30 million for its property-casualty losses.
Climate change is not specifically addressed in Zenith’s investment policy. Please refer to Question 2 Strategy for
further information regarding our investment policies.

emissions.
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the
related risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and

RESPONSE FOR METRICS AND TARGETS:
Since workers’ compensation is our primary line of business, our exposure to climate-related risks is reduced.
Nevertheless, we do measure our exposure to weather-related catastrophic events each year through catastrophe
modelling and periodically review the estimated probable maximum pre-tax loss for such exposures.
Zenith estimates that its 2023 greenhouse gas emissions consisted of 962.79 tonnes, COze in Scope 1 emissions
and 3,023.63 tonnes, CO:e in Scope 2 emissions. Zenith could not estimate its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions
data in a materially accurate or complete manner as of this date. We plan to track emission calculations according
to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and hope to report such calculations in the following year. As an insurer, Zenith’s

operations are primarily conducted in office settings, most of which are leased. We strive to reduce our emissions
in our own operations. For example, at our corporate headquarters, we installed a solar-powered electrical system.
The system generates just over one gigawatt of energy at peak performance. Zenith expects to offset 50% of our
current electricity bill using solar power and the project will - over its expected 25-year lifespan - reduce total
carbon output by an estimated 62 million pounds (compared to continued use of current sources of electricity).
Following the COVID pandemic, most Zenith employees work-from-home four days a week, which significantly
reduces emissions related to commuting and will reduce office space over time.

Zenith continues to operate in a paperless environment and is working toward using more cloud storage solutions
to reduce our dependence on data centers.

STRATEGY RESPONSE:
Zenith is a national property-casualty insurer that is admitted in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Workers’
compensation and employer's liability insurance is our primary line of business. In addition to workers’
compensation and employer's liability insurance, Zenith also writes the following lines of insurance in California
for risks in the farm and agriculture industries: commercial auto, commercial general liability, commercial multi-
peril and commercial property.
We believe that an extended drought or significant flooding in California is an ongoing, climate-related risk with
potential adverse consequences for California agriculture. More than half of our California workers’ compensation
premium is derived from within the agricultural industry. Periodically, as needed to address any emerging risks, we
evaluate the impact of a stress scenario in which we lose 50% of our agriculture-based workers’ compensation
premiums due to drought or floods at the same time as competition reduces our writings elsewhere by 20%. The
last stress test scenario did not result in an adverse change in the company’s AM Best capital adequacy ratio, the
measure we use to assess capital adequacy. Zenith’s property lines of business are exposed to the variabilities of
climate change. The potential for natural disaster/weather-related perils is factored into pricing and underwriting
practices. Additionally, Zenith uses reinsurance to manages its climate change risks in its property business.
Overall, Zenith believes its short-term and mid-term climate-related risks to be manageable
Zenith engages its customers on climate-related risks in various ways. Potential workers’ compensation-related
impacts to customers from climate change influenced events are included in the extensive claims, medical, and
safety and health services which are provided to customers in mitigating their individual exposures. Zenith provides
numerous resources to its customers, including information on its website, publications, and on-site visits, and
identifies precautions that can be taken to avoid situations that can lead to occupational accidents and injuries.
Zenith presents the advantages of solar and wind power to assist in mitigating overall energy costs to its
commercial property-casualty customers. Zenith continuously investigates if a facility has exposure to weather-
related hazards. The importance of disaster planning and recovery programs is emphasized given its role in large
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, windstorms, tornadoes, floods, and wildfires. Zenith also provides
industry updates to its insureds on sustainability and practices relating to such areas as conservation and the
management of soil and water. This is especially relevant to its California agriculture policyholders. In addition, we
are active supporters of organizations such as the California Workers Compensation Institute, the Workers
Compensation Research Institute, the California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom, California Future
Farmers of America, California Fresh Fruit Association and the California Ag Leadership Foundation.
Regarding investments, environmental risk is viewed as a category of business risk, and it is part of the overall
decision-making process when assessing an investment. Zenith’s investment objectives are (a) to invest on a

long-term basis in accordance with applicable insurance regulatory guidelines; and (b) to ensure preservation of
invested capital for policyholder protection, always providing sufficient liquidity for the payment of claims and
other policy obligations. Investment guidelines require all investments to be made using the long-term value
investing approach by investing in securities of companies and other entities at prices below their underlying long-
term values to protect the Company's capital from loss and earn income over time and provide operating income
as needed. Environmental, social and governance issues have become factors in the investment analysis and
decision-making process. Deficiencies or excessive risk in these areas could lead to the rejection of investment
opportunities or the sale of existing positions. In some cases, climate change or other environmental issues will
bea risk to a business - perhaps as products are phased out, capital expenditures increase to comply with
stricter environmental laws, carbon taxes reduce demand, new technology creates substitutes for a company’s
high carbon footprint products, etc. A large proportion of our investment portfolio is held in short-term securities
or government bonds. These investment classes typically tend to have less exposure to environmental, social and
governance issues.

RISK MANAGEMENT RESPONSE:
Climate change exposure is incorporated into Zenith’s overall risk management policies. Zenith’s workers’
compensation insurance business is concentrated in California and Florida and Zenith’s commercial property and
casualty insurance business is entirely concentrated in California. California and Florida are states that are exposed
to climate and environmental changes, natural perils such as earthquake, hurricanes, floods and availability of
water supplies, along with the possibility of pandemics and terrorist acts. Accordingly, Zenith could suffer losses as
a result of catastrophic events in these states. Zenith’s catastrophe management strategies are designed to mitigate

its exposure. Through a combination of reinsurance, underwriting controls and careful tracking of exposures,
supported by technology, Zenith is focused on effectively managing risks.
For workers’ compensation insurance, Zenith carefully monitors the number of covered lives by zip code to avoid a
concentration of workers in any small geographic area. Zenith limits individual underwriters’ ability to insure any
risk with a significant number of covered lives. Over half of Zenith’s California workers’ compensation business is
in California agriculture, which by its nature does not have large number of workers in individual buildings, but could
be impacted by climate and environmental changes. Risk management for potential workers’ compensation-
related impacts to customers include extensive claims, medical, and safety and health services which are provided
to customers in mitigating their individual exposures. For commercial property and casualty insurance, Zenith
implements similar measures. Zenith carefully monitors property aggregation and proactively reaches out to
potentially affected insureds during ongoing catastrophes. Zenith limits individual underwriters’ authority and
proactively oversees catastrophe management. Zenith evaluates the effects of climate and climate change to
operations and facilities through loss control inspections.
In addition, Zenith purchases excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance up to $150 million for its workers’
compensation losses and excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance up to $30 million for its property-casualty losses.
Climate change is not specifically addressed in Zenith’s investment policy. Please refer to Question 2 Strategy for
further information regarding our investment policies.
METRICS AND TARGETS
4. Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material.
In disclosing the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant collateralized risks and
opportunities where such information is material, insurers should consider including the following:
* Discuss how the insurer uses catastrophe modeling to manage the climate-related risks to your business.
Please specify for which climate-related risks the insurer uses catastrophe models to assess, if any.
A. Disclose the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with
its strategy and risk management process.
In disclosing the metrics used by the insurer to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its
strategy and risk management process, insurers should consider including the following:
‘+ In describing the metrics used by the insurer to assess and monitor climate risks, consider the amount of
exposure to business lines, sectors, and geographies vulnerable to climate-related physical risks [answer in
absolute amounts and percentages if possible], alignment with climate scenarios, [1 in 100 years probable
maximum loss, Climate VaR, carbon intensity], and the amount of financed or underwritten carbon
emissions.
B. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the
related risks.
C. Describe the targets used by the insurer to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and
performance against targets.
RESPONSE FOR METRICS AND TARGETS:
Since workers’ compensation is our primary line of business, our exposure to climate-related risks is reduced.
Nevertheless, we do measure our exposure to weather-related catastrophic events each year through catastrophe
modelling and periodically review the estimated probable maximum pre-tax loss for such exposures.
Zenith estimates that its 2023 greenhouse gas emissions consisted of 962.79 tonnes, COze in Scope 1 emissions
and 3,023.63 tonnes, CO:e in Scope 2 emissions. Zenith could not estimate its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions
data in a materially accurate or complete manner as of this date. We plan to track emission calculations according
to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and hope to report such calculations in the following year. As an insurer, Zenith’s

operations are primarily conducted in office settings, most of which are leased. We strive to reduce our emissions
in our own operations. For example, at our corporate headquarters, we installed a solar-powered electrical system.
The system generates just over one gigawatt of energy at peak performance. Zenith expects to offset 50% of our
current electricity bill using solar power and the project will - over its expected 25-year lifespan - reduce total
carbon output by an estimated 62 million pounds (compared to continued use of current sources of electricity).
Following the COVID pandemic, most Zenith employees work-from-home four days a week, which significantly
reduces emissions related to commuting and will reduce office space over time.

Zenith continues to operate in a paperless environment and is working toward using more cloud storage solutions
to reduce our dependence on data centers.
