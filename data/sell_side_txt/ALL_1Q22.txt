1Q22 Review: Revisiting "Preferred"
Class
While Allstate brand is synonymous with preferred drivers,
NatGen, its non-standard book, appears more resilient to
inflationary pressures. With less new vehicles with bells and
whistles, NatGen vehicles are cheaper to repair. As such, ALL is
growing more non-standard auto (monoline).

ALL's auto remediation path appears slower than others for the following reasons: 1.) Allstate
brand customers tend to have more expensive and often new vehicles and higher opt in for full
comprehension coverage 2.) ALL's premium orientation is slightly more dominated in states that
is seeing >15% severity, 3.) Post pandemic ALL decreased rates later than others (by low single
digits), therefore these lower rates have not been fully cycled out yet delaying the effect of
earning in rate increases (delayed recognition through 3Q23). Likewise, ALL plans to top off the
rate increases it has been taking so far going forward.

Even though Allstate brand's customer demographics is synonymous with preferred drivers, its
underlying auto combined ratio (of 99.3%) lags NatGen (of 95.4%) that is more focused on non-
standard auto drivers. While opposing performance for these divisions is counter intuitive, we
would rank file auto physical damage pressures ahead of other contributors (frequency, and
bodily injury, though still noteworthy). NatGen customers don't buy full comprehensive
coverage and its cars do not have as many bells and whistles (sensors, digital dashboards, etc.)
Likewise, NatGen customers have been back on the road much earlier on, reverting to pre-
pandemic frequency early in 2021. Therefore, NatGen does not have the same drag of frequency
going up. ALL is purposely growing more non-standard auto with NatGen auto PIF up 13% y/y.
Conversely, ALL is instilling its superior homeowners underwriting practices upon NatGen,
resulting in NatGen homeowners PIF down 5% y/y.

Investment portfolio actions to shorten asset duration: Starting in late 2021, ALL sold long
durated fixed income assets to counterbalance the negative impact on valuation, given higher
interest rates resulting in a lower fixed income portfolio yield and investment income in the near
term. As such, ALL shortened its asset duration to 3.1 years in 1Q22 from 3.8 years in 2021 and
5.0 years in 2020. It makes sense, given it sold its life business. We assume the duration of its
liabilities is now less than 3 years. ALL's AOCI has dropped to $(953)mn at March 31, 2022 from
$655mn at YE21.

ALL doesn't have an AOCI component of fixed income in its view of available capital which
gleans on its economic capital framework and statutory surplus. However, unlike other P&C

active calls on bonds. It is our understanding that many insurers like CB and TRV elect FMV
reporting for flexibility but for the most part choose to HTM. As such, ALL is managing its BVPS
growth more actively by making tweaks to its asset duration. Consequently, ALL had mitigated
$0.8bn negative marks on its portfolio. ALL's market-based reinvestment rates are below its
average fixed income portfolio yield, vs. peers who are already seeing the opposite. Eventually,
with a shorter durated portfolio, ALL is planning to reinvest upon interest rates rising further.

pricing correction actions may stall

execution of Allstate's
transformational growth plans via

Severity Trend by State
Allstate brand expects to see severity for property damage rise to 11% in '22E vs. '21. This is on
top of the higher severity that incurred 2Q21-4Q21. Severity trends also differ by state. We were
surprised to see relatively lower severity in populous states like CA, FL, and TX. Shifting to bodily
injury, ALL highlighted TX accounting for 80% of its bodily injury adverse PYD actions taken this
quarter. Note, ALL's TX auto premiums represent nearly 10% of its total (vs. 9% of the industry
allocation).

ALL no longer leading the industry on its loss ratio
Historically, ALL has shown a consistent track record of outperforming the industry, as
measured by the statutory direct incurred loss ratio until 2Q21. While ALL no longer
underperformed the industry during 3Q21, that does not mean its performance got better; the
industry just caught up. On this basis, ALL also noticeably unperformed PGR in 2Q21 and 4Q21
(just a lesser degree in 3Q21).
We asked Mario Rizzo, CFO his thoughts on these data points. According to Mario, peers have
cycled out most of the prior rate decreases from the start of the pandemic allowing others to
earn in the rate increases earlier. In comparison ALL decreased rates later than others, therefore
these lower rates have not been fully cycled out yet delaying the effect of earning in rate
increases.

GAAP Auto Loss Ratios: ALL vs. PGR
From a GAAP perspective, the gap between PGR and ALL started to narrow in 2Q21. By 4Q21, as
well as 1Q22, ALL no longer outperformed PGR. Keep in mind PGR operates at a lower expense
ratio than ALL. Note, we looked at total auto loss ratios, there may be nuances with PYD and
cats.

1Q22 is serving as a tough quarter for auto results yet 4Q21 seems to be the trough.
Nevertheless, ALL's 60 bps q/q improvement with respect to its GAAP auto underlying loss ratio
(ex cats & PYD) is underwhelming relative to peers' sequential progress: (i.e. MCY 200 bps, TRV
470 bps). Note, not every insurer provides the finer details to make like for like comparisons.
Geico's auto loss ratio ex PYD sequential improvement was 3.4 pts. PGR's auto loss ratio ex cats
sequential improvement was 3.4 pts. Conversely, KMPR's underlying personal auto loss ratio
deteriorated by 13 pts q/q.

1Q22 Highlights
We remain cautious about the potentially elongated time it will take for the sector's pricing to
catch up with loss trend but recognize ALL's diligence. Performance-based NII results declined
from record 2021.
Auto Loss trends:
· Within Allstate brand, property damage gross claim frequency of 18.4% y/y in 1Q22
remained elevated but is below 21.5% in 4Q21. Per the 10Q, ALL characterized frequency to
remain below pre-pandemic levels.
· Property damage gross claim severity of 11% in 1Q22 remained elevated but is below 18.2%
in 4Q21.
. Bodily injury increased by 8% y/y. The current 2021 estimated report year incurred claim
severity increased by about 5% vs. 2020 due to rising medical treatment, increased severity
of claims with attorney representation and higher medical care inflation.
Underwriting details: ALL delivered a 1Q Property-Liability underlying combined ratio of
90.9% (vs. our estimate of 91.1%), an improvement from 91.3% in 4Q21 driven by the expense
ratio. ALL's underlying loss ratio of 67.4% (vs. our estimate of 66.9%) increased relative to
4Q21 of 67.0%. ALL's 1Q underlying expense ratio of 23.5% was down q/q from 24.3% in 4Q21.
Prior year reserve strengthening of $158mn most evident within auto physical damage and
bodily injury coverages. ALL's reported 102.1% auto combined ratio was impacted by 2.0 pts of
adverse PYD. In comparison we modeled an auto combined ratio of 103.5%. Auto underlying
loss ratio down to 74.9% in 1Q22 vs. 75.5% in 4Q21 . We had estimated 75.7% auto underlying
loss ratio for 1Q22.
Allstate Brand Auto PIF growth was flat y/y.
Repurchase Program progress: ALL repurchased ~$794mn in 1Q (vs. our estimate of $660mn).
ALL expects to complete the $5bn buyback program by 1Q23, $2.5bn authorization remains
outstanding.
2022/2023 Nationwide Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance: Fully placed, providing $6.61bn
coverage in excess of a $500mn retention and various co-insurance by layers. In comparison, its
national program placed on June 1, 2021 provided $5.76bn coverage in excess of a $500mn
retention and various co-insurance by layers.
Key Results
ALL's 1Q22 Operating EPS of $2.58 was above our $2.33 estimate but below the $2.90 consensus
street estimate. Relative to our estimates, the beat primarily reflected better than expected NPE
and slightly better combined ratio of 97.3% vs. our estimated 97.7%. Buybacks of $794mn beat
our estimate of $660mn. NII of $594mn fell short of our expectations as performance-based
results declined from record 2021. Still NII contributed $1.56 to EPS eclipsing property-liability
insurance underwriting EPS contribution of $0.95.

Our Equal Weight rating and $132 price target (down from $137) are based on a 50/50 weighted
average of ~12x our 2023 EPS estimates of $12.24 and 1.4x our YE23 book value per share ex
AOCI estimates of $84.07. Prior methodology was based on a 50/50 weighted average of ~12x
our 2023 EPS estimates of $12.59 and 1.4x our YE23 book value per share ex AOCI estimates of
$87.2. We look forward to seeing progress on ALL's transformative growth plan. We would be
more constructive on the stock when ALL shows signs of PIF growth while returning to mid 90%
auto combined ratio. We think that scenario is more likely when adverse loss cost trends
meaningfully abate.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

*This is the closing price referenced in the publication, which may not be
the last available closing price at the time of publication.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or
an affiliate.
N: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $132 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of ~12x our 2023 EPS estimates of
$12.24 and 1.4x our YE23 book value per share ex AOCI estimates of $84.07.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.
