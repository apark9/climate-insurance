2Q23 Earnings: Another Beat and Raise, But Difficult to
Chase Stock At These Levels
KNSL's 2Q23 was more of the same - with premiums and margins trending ahead
of expectations - and in our view a good signal for strong results in future quarters.
As such, our EPS estimates and price target are going up. Although we think that
Kinsale has shown itself to be a high-quality E&S operator, we are reluctant to
chase the stock because of its full valuation, even if we are proven wrong (yet
again) by a hard P&C market that has lasted well beyond initial expectations.
路 EPS beat. KNSL reported 2Q23 operating EPS of $2.88, well above our $2.62
estimate and consensus of $2.48. Compared to our model, KNSL posted better
underwriting margins (+$0.23 favorable vs. our estimate) and investment
income (+$0.07). Net written premium growth was strong (+50.6% vs.
+34.0%E), which has positive implications for future earned premium and
new/renewal written premiums. Investment income continued to benefit from
strong operating cash flow and an improving portfolio yield.
路 Slight accounting wrinkle will affect the comparability of underwriting
results this quarter. Due to their growing size on the P&L, KNSL changed its
accounting treatment for policy fees beginning April 1 and now shows them as
a revenue item instead of a contra-expense to offset other underwriting
expenses (only financials for 1Q22, 2Q22, 1Q23, and 2Q23 are available on
this basis for now). As a result, the combined ratio (and its component loss and
expense ratios) will now have the sum of earned premiums and policy fees in
the denominator. Applied to historical financials, this change would imply a
decline in the loss ratio (higher denominator) and an increase in the expense
ratio (higher denominator offset by a larger numerator).
路 Underwriting results still strong either way. KNSL reported a combined
ratio of 76.7% in 2Q23 under the new accounting policy, consisting of a 55.7%
loss ratio and a 21.0% expense ratio. Under prior accounting, this would have
translated to a combined ratio of 76.1%, which is directly comparable (and
better) than our 79.1% assumption. The loss ratio would have been 57.2% (vs.
58.9%E), driven by lower attritional losses, lower catastrophes, and higher
favorable development. The expense ratio would have been 18.9% (vs.
20.2%E) due to higher ceding commissions paid by reinsurers to KNSL.
路 Miscellaneous items from 2Q23. (1) KNSL continues to manage down the
duration of its investment portfolio (3.1 years in 2Q23 versus 3.4 years in 1Q23
and 4.2 years in 2Q22). Portfolio yields are running roughly 100-120 bps
higher versus last year. (2) No change in favorable commentary about
submission activity and pricing (across most lines of business). (3) Average
written premiums per policy were $17,800 in 2Q23, up 23% from $14,500 in
2Q22, and an acceleration from mid-teens growth in the past several quarters.
(4) Reserve releases of $10.4 million in 2Q23 consisted of $14.4 million of
favorable development from accident years 2021 and 2022, partly offset by
adverse development on property damage claims within construction-related
casualty business from accident years 2017 and 2019.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly
traded P&C insurer that operates exclusively in the E&S
insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts.
Our long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large
addressable market, superior technology platform, and low cost
base, which we view as a sustainable competitive advantage.
Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are
concerned about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C
pricing cycle moderates.

Investment Thesis
Please see Page 5 for tables
summarizing 2Q23 results. KNSL will
hold its earnings conference call at 9:00
AM Eastern on July 28, 2023. The dial-in
number for the call is 888-660-6493;
code: 3573726. The call replay will be
available on https://
ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We affirm our Neutral rating. We expect KNSL's premiums and margins to benefit
from favorable trends in the E&S market, which continues to generate outsized growth
at attractive pricing/terms. The property insurance market is particularly compelling,
and KNSL intends to grow the relative size of this business (25% of premiums in 1Q23,
20% of premiums in 2022) while controlling its exposure to property catastrophe risk.
Also, we think that Kinsale's low-cost operating model is a sustainable competitive
advantage across the pricing cycle, especially against higher cost competitors like
Lloyd's writers. On the other hand, our view is that the stock's valuation is full
compared to commercial peers and specialist names even after giving credit to KNSL's
growth potential and above-average margins. Further, while favorable P&C market
conditions are likely to persist through 2023 and will have positive implications for
KNSL's reserves and future earnings, the eventual turn in the P&C pricing cycle is a
downside risk to its above-average multiple.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
In our view, the E&S market - where KNSL operates exclusively - will eventually see
moderating new business volumes and price hikes as more underwriters focus on growth
(weighing on pricing) and admitted markets increase their appetite for risk (recapturing
business that had been diverted to E&S). Still, we think that KNSL can grow premiums
at a strong pace given its small base and the fragmented nature of the pricing cycle
whereby certain lines (property, marine) are only beginning to benefit from harder
prices despite a slowdown in other lines. With respect to profitability, we expect the
combination of price hikes - historical and prospective - and conservative reserving to
support healthy margins at KNSL over the medium term.
Low Cost Operating Model a Durable Competitive Advantage
KNSL has a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform built from ground up -
in contrast to peers that use unwieldy hybrid systems consisting of legacy platforms and
newer technologies - which allows it to handle significant business volumes without
sacrificing customer responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense efficiency. As a
result, KNSL maintains an industry leading expense ratio, and we expect it to
outperform higher cost competitors (especially Lloyd's which is more than 20% of the
E&S market) through the pricing cycle. During softer markets, KNSL can grow
premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-average profitability. In hard
markets, Kinsale can be a price taker and generate an even larger excess return.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect overall price hikes
to eventually moderate as re/insurers re-position themselves for growth (property and
catastrophe coverage likely to be the exception in the near term). Given this, we see
multiple compression as a risk since pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in
E&S given its function as a safety valve for the P&C industry. Although we think some
portion of market share gains by E&S are permanent and that KNSL will thrive even if
prices soften, our view is that a reasonable valuation analysis will have to look several
years out because of KNSL's above-average growth profile and would therefore have to
account for how conditions in the P&C market are likely to be at that future time.

Increasing EPS Estimates
We are raising 3Q23 EPS from $2.62 to $2.82, 2023 EPS from $10.80 to $11.46, and
2024 EPS from $13.98 to $15.07. We are assuming higher investment income in future
periods given KNSL's higher jump off point in 2Q23. Also, we are assuming higher
premium growth for the balance of 2H23 (from 38% to 40%) but leaving our future
premium growth assumptions unchanged. As we have said on several occasions, we
think KNSL is more likely than not to continue surprising to the upside given the
positive momentum underpinning its premium growth, underwriting margins, and
investment income. However, our concern is that even after giving credit for most of
these factors, KNSL still trades at a significant premium versus peers. Additionally,
even if KNSL's stock could justifiably trade at a permanent (albeit lower) premium for
structural reasons (high quality franchise, above-average growth, pricing advantage), we
think its current valuation multiple has an embedded benefit from the favorable P&C
environment, which is not permanent and will eventually deteriorate.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale (Neutral; Price Target: $350.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our
long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior
technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2024 price target from $340 to $350. Our price target
assumes a 5x multiple on 2025 book value and a 19x multiple on 2025 operating income.
These target multiples are well above peers', which we think is supported by KNSL's above-
average premium growth (long-term low- to mid-teens growth versus mid- to high-single-
digit growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile (high 70s to low 80s CR
versus 85-90% for peers). KNSL trades at 10.1x BV, well above specialty peers (ex. PLMR)
of 2.1x and commercial peers at 1.6x. On 2024E earnings, KNSL trades at 25x versus 11x
for specialty insurers and 10x for commercial insurers.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
. The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher prices and
greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If current conditions
persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our forecasts and investor
sentiment would likely improve.
路 Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We would
expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds growth
expectations in the next few years.
路 Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving suggests margin
improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin improvement tracks higher than
expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
路 Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are pushing
back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are deploying capital and
positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to turn, there is a risk of multiple
compression for insurers that have seen an outsized benefit from higher prices.
路 Adverse loss trends or social inflation reemerge in casualty reserves. Although
unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and low limits, the
reopening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up liability claims.
路 Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has a
strong underwriting track record, and it is entering new lines in a strong part of the cycle.

Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage, the impact of badly underwritten
risks is likely to persist. Also, inflation is a risk for both casualty and property coverages.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average
total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this
stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Underweight
[Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the
analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country
market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying
analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
