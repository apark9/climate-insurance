AIG, Inc.
3Q23 Earnings Review: Business Mix
Optimization
AIG can afford to shrink business lines where it is not seeing the
risk reward like financial lines (down 11%) and 2 large Lexington
programs ($115mn of NPW) that were catastrophe
focused. Now that Validus Re is sold, which helps its PML, AIG
can increase its property risk appetite.

We found AIG's commentary on casualty and public D&O headwinds as thoughtful and candid.
AIG recapped its underwriting actions 5 year journey, we would have liked to hear more
information about any changes in terms & conditions. We were struck by Lexington Casualty
new business growth of +90% y/y (E&S business allows more freedom of form.) Likewise, excess
casualty led growth by 33% y/y followed by property at 27% y/y within core Lexington (ex non-
renewal of programs.) On a seasonality basis, we sense that 3Q is a lighter quarter for E&S
property. While investor sentiment is cautious on casualty reserving, AIG's ADC with NICO (AYs
2015 and prior) provides some comfort with $9bn of gross limit remaining/$7.2bn of net limit
remaining (at the 80% level.) Still, we will continue to pay attention to AYs 2016-2018, and to a
lesser degree AY2019. AIG had embraced a more pragmatic reinsurance strategy in 2021 given
its accomplished remediation efforts and in hindsight over-indexing to the market. While at the
time, over-indexing reinsurance purchases may have compressed margin opportunities, that
move likely provided added protection for its casualty reserves.

Despite business mix optimization, AIG's pricing power decelerated q/q. Specifically, NA
commercial rate increases of 5.4% (vs 8% last quarter), or 6% rate increases ex workers
compensation and exposure growth of 3% (vs 2% last quarter) sums up to 9% pricing increases
(vs 10% last quarter.)

GI PYD: $139mn favorable, of which $129mn resulted from AIG's detailed valuation reserves (or
DVRs.) AIG's DVRs covered 70% of its reserve total (on pre-ADC basis.) Favorable development
was better than expected. Still, we were struck by $40mn reserve releases in U.S. excess casualty
and $200mn of reserve releases from greener AYs 2021 and 2020. We include later in this note
(figures 2 & 3) the PYD breakout.

NA Commercial AYLR improvement standout: NA Commercial AYLR ex cats of 57.8% (vs. our
61.0% estimate) improved 2.7pts q/q and improved 4.7 pts y/y. As pricing power is decelerating,
we anticipate further underlying margin savings to come from improvements in business mix.

AIG positioning in Public D&O market: AIG is one of the primary market leaders, it saw rates
flat to slightly down while pricing pressures magnified on excess layers, particular higher
layers. Excess public D&O new business down y/y and renewal retention is down 11 pts.
Validus impact to 3Q results: Accretive to the global commercial combined ratio by >100bps in
3Q23, no difference in global commercial accident year combined ratio. NA Commercial NPW
decreased (7.7)% y/y, ex Validus adds 3.7% NPW growth y/y and ex crop adds 8.9% NPW growth
y/y. Likewise, Validus portion of catastrophe losses was $70mn (included in the total $462mn.)
PF AIG ex CRBG Book Value: Given the sale of Validus Re and the redeployment of proceeds
into share repurchases and debt reduction, AIG revised its view of current PF AIG equity (ex
CRBG) to $37bn (from the prior $40bn) including $4bn of DTA. AIG calculates ROCE on an ex DTA
basis, or $33bn of adjusted shareholders equity. We infer that AIG ex CRBG needs to make at
least $3.3bn of annual operating earnings to meet its 10% of greater ROCE target. We
understand that PF SHE ex AOCI for Remain Co. reflects to AIG's legal entity balance sheet view
and does not take into consideration an implied valuation for its remaining 65.6% stake in
CRBG, as that piece is not in AIG's starting point.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
We view AIG as a wait-and-see
proposition as it goes down the
complex path of deconsolidation as
well as ongoing initiatives to
achieve expense savings objectives.
Upside case
USD 78.00
Eventual successful deconsolidation
that yields a fair market value
resulting in a rerating of AIG
RemainCo. Our upside case of $78
assumes ~10.3x our '24 EPS
estimate.
Downside case
USD 55.00
Adverse reserve development
accompanying expansion of
underwriting risk appetite too fast
too soon. Our downside case of $55
assumes ~7.3x our '24 EPS estimate.

NA commercial rate increases of 5.4% (vs 8% last quarter), or 6% rate increases ex workers
compensation and exposure growth of 3% (vs 2% last quarter) sums up to 9% pricing increases
(vs 10% last quarter.) In prior quarters, AIG mentioned loss cost trends of 6.5%
(unchanged). International Commercial rates increased 4% (vs 9% last quarter) while exposure
increased 2% (vs. 1% last quarter.)

NPW growth on a comparable basis (ex Validus and crop); GI NPW increased 9% y/y thanks to
growth in both the North American (up 5%) and International (up 7%) segments. NA
Commercial increased 5% y/y due to growth in Lexington (25% y/y), led by growth in casualty
(up 33% y/y) and property (+27% y/y). International Commercial NPW increased by 7% y/y
driven by property (+13% y/y), global specialty (up 12%), and Talbot (+7% y/y). New business
was up 13% y/y in NA Commercial (+27% ex Financial Lines) and up 90% y/y in
Lexington Casualty. Conversely, financial lines shrunk (11)% y/y - the brunt of which was
experienced in NA while International is not experiencing the same rate issues.
Favorable PYD Better than Expected
GI $139mn Favorable PYD (inc. other), releases from multiple accident years, it was most
pronounced in AY21 ($114mn release) and AY20 ($82mn release.) Most of the releases reflected
WC and international financial lines. AIG moved its reserve review cadence, WC to 3Q from 2Q,
yet it completed its U.S. casualty review in 2Q. We were pleased to see that US financial lines
PYD was modestly unfavorable (vs. $653mn unfavorable in 3Q22.) We had modeled net
unfavorable PYD of $60mn in NA Commercial for 3Q23. GI favorable PYD of $142mn in 3Q
was larger than prior quarters of $115mn in 2Q and $68mn in 1Q.

Forward Looking Statements
Further debt reduction. Leverage is a key consideration with respect to AIG's share repurchase
strategy. AIG plans to ramp up debt repayment during 4Q23.
Hold Co Liquidity: The Validus and Laya Healthcare sale will yield about $3.7bn of additional
parent liquidity in 4Q23. To recap, net proceeds of Laya healthcare was $730mn, of which CRBG
is paying a special dividend. Validus Re net proceeds were $3.3bn of cash and $275mn RNR
shares. AIG deployed $289mn to retire Validus Re debt right before the deal closed on Nov. 1.
Capital allocation. AIG's $7.5bn board authorized share repurchases program will drive its
share count reduction to 600mn. Based on current average daily trading volumes, AIG expects
to repurchase about $1.5bn of shares a quarter or $500mn a month, beginning when the market
window opens after its earnings. AIG expect to continue at this rate into 2024.

Furthermore, in Sept. 2023, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the UK Life
Insurance business to Aviva Plc for £460mn, to close sometime in 2Q24, subject to regulatory
approvals. AIG expects its share of proceeds to be used for buybacks.
Investment yields. Average new money yields are 5.88% (~145 bps higher than the yield on
sales and maturities). In General Insurance, fixed maturity and loan portfolio yields increased by
88 bps y/y and 9 bps q/q. In Life and Retirement, the yield increased 63 bps y/y and 9 bps q/q.
Leadership Changes in GI: AIG has eliminated a management layer and plans to continue this
process in 2024.
3Q Highlights
Underlying combined ratio of 86.3% (212 bps improvement y/y) vs. our estimated 88.5%.
· NA Commercial NPW was down (8)% y/y. However, on a comparable basis NA
Commercial NPW was up 5%. Key adjustments were the exclusion of Validus Re and Crop.
Outside these adjustments, AIG non-renewed some program business that was cat heavy, out
of Lexington.
· Property NPW increased 12% y/y. Financial lines shrunk (11)% y/y.
· Commercial Lines. NA Commercial AYLR ex cats of 57.8% (vs. our 61.0% estimate)
improved 2.7pts q/q and improved 4.7 pts y/y. International Commercial AYCR improved by
~70 bps y/y and improved by ~340 bps sequentially.
Personal Lines. NA Personal Lines AYCR was again unprofitable at 108.4% in 3Q23, vs. 107.1%
in 2Q23, 107.6% in 1Q23, and 112.8% in 3Q22).
Life and Retirement: Within Individual Retirement (IR), base net investment spread
increased to 2.79% in 3Q23 vs. 2.70% in 2Q23. While FA sales were up 2% y/y and up 6% q/q, FIA
sales were up 27% y/y but down 4% q/q. PRT sales were $137mn in 3Q23 and down from $1.9bn
in 2Q23. Negligible assumption update.
Fixed annuity surrender rate increased sequentially from 15.9% to 17.7% amid a backlog from
earlier in the year. On a monthly basis, surrenders peaked early in the quarter and declined
sequentially each month with continued improvement in October.
BVPS (common) fell to $56.06 in 3Q23, from $58.49 in 2Q23.
VII: Alternative returns of about 1% were $185mn (pre-tax) worse than AIG's expectations, we
modeled $44mn adverse. Private equity returns were a key driver as AIG reduced its exposure to
hedge funds over the last year.
Cat losses: $427mn (net of reinsurance) vs. our $548mn estimate.
Capital Management: Parent liquidity (ex CRBG) was $3.6bn at 9/30/23, down from $4.3bn at
6/30/23. AIG repurchased $785mn of shares (vs. our $800mn estimate).
Elevated tax rate of 26.3% reflecting geographic premium shift and a Japanese legacy tax issue.
EPS Beat: AIG's 3Q23 operating EPS of $1.61 was above our $1.16 estimate and
$1.48 Street consensus estimate. The beat was driven by better GI underwriting income
including better catastrophe losses, PYD releases and underlying margins vs. estimates.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

our 2024 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given we expect lower ROEs.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a
separation. Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to walk
away from business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings or capital
but undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post separation may
temper AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.

information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
