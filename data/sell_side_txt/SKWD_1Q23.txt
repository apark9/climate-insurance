1Q23 Review: Beat is Evidence of
Foundational Improvements
AYLR improvements (210 bps q/q) and GWP growth (+28% y/y)
are exemplary. We remain especially constructive on SKWD's
growth prospects in global property and E&S.
Rates vs. Loss trends: Pure rates in high single digits are above loss cost inflation, with
exposure that acts like rate contributing 1 additional point in the quarter. Management provided
some color by segment: (1) social inflation in personal injury will continue to pressure prices
higher. Commercial auto pricing is ahead of SKWD's 9-10% loss trend. Commercial auto is a
lower proportion of total writings (18% 1Q23 vs. 22/23% 1Q22.) The company also has a
whole account quota share on their auto book for protection. (2) Management is comfortable
with pricing on the medical stop loss, professional liabilities, private company management
liability, and property lines. (3) Pricing remains attractive across most parts of the E&S and
Specialty Admitted space.
Exposure growth: Within global property, exposure growth was mostly seen in insured values.
At the same time, SKWD raised its attachment points which structurally tempers net exposure
growth. SKWD is growing units within E&S but insureds are also retaining more risk to a degree
to defease rising insurance costs.
Strong GWP growth: Management is constructive about growth prospects but its 28% y/y GWP
growth in 1Q23 is a tough benchmark to beat. 2Q is coming in strong so far and 1H23 should
exceed 20% GWP growth. Management would be overjoyed if >20% GWP could continue in 2H23
but it is not something they are penciling in.
NWP Growth Nuance: NWP growth of 49% y/y was obscured by the restructuring of a global
property quota share reinsurance treaty in 1Q22.
AYLR 210 bps improvement Q/Q due to business mix changes: We were expecting a more
gradual/linear improvement in its AYLR as our 62.8% estimate exceeded its 61.1% actual. SKWD
can achieve more noticeable improvements in its AYLR given the exited business piece that had
posed a drag on its historical AYLR. We think SKWD's 61.1% AYLR achievement is not an anomaly
and we can see continued underlying margin expansion from here.
SKWD's 27.4% expense ratio in 1Q23 is less repeatable given the following non-trendable items:
1.) more premium leverage 2.) higher than typical contra expenses from fee income and 3.) a
delay in planned investments.

Ceded Re Strategy: The May 1 property catastrophe renewal was in line with managements'
price and term expectations. The new XOL property treaty (occurrence) covers $28mn in excess
of a $12mn retention (up from $10mn previously). While $12mn is higher on an absolute dollar
basis, on a risk return basis it is lower. Its $12mn retention equates to a 1/10 risk return period
which makes sense as that is the typical PML for an event retained in earnings. On the top of the
tower, SKWD maintains reinsurance limits in excess of a 1 in 250 year event. For context, the
cover was not used last year and the only event that came close to hitting a retention point was
a storm in Louisiana a couple years ago at a lower retention point. The company also has cover
on second and third events that are lower than $12mn.
Valuation. We reiterate our Overweight rating and raise our price target to $27 (from $23) which
is based on a 50/50 weighted 11.5x (up from 10.0x) P/E multiple on our '24 EPS estimate of $2.32
(from $2.04) and 1.8x (up from 1.6x) P/TBV excluding AOCI on our '24 TBVPS excluding AOCI of
$15.40 (from $15.47).

Why OVERWEIGHT?
E&S writers trade at a premium to
admitted writers. SKWD's multiple
could increase over time as the E&S
becomes a larger piece of their
overall mix from its current ~50%,
achievable within transactional E&S
and property. SKWD's stock
performance could hinge more on
execution than peers given a
shorter operating history under the
current management team.
Upside case
USD 30.00
Over time, multiple expansion
could come from the shift of
business mix towards the E&S
market and we expect underwriting
profitability to improve in
2023/2024. Our upside case of $30 is
based on a ~13x P/E '24 and 1.9x
TBVPS for common shareholders ex
AOCI '24.
Downside case
USD 20.00
A slowdown in the E&S market and
unforeseen reserving issues from
their LPT transaction could lead to
sentiment risk compared to peers.
Our downside case of $20 is based
on a ~9x P/E '24 and 1.3x TBVPS for
common shareholders ex AOCI '24.

1Q23 Highlights
Operating earnings beat: SKWD reported 1Q23 adjusted net operating earnings of $15.5mn or
$0.42 per share which was better than our estimate of $14.4mn or $0.37 per share. The Street
11 May 2023

was at $0.34 per share. The beat was due to better-than-expected combined ratio (90.2% vs. our
92.2%) driven by both a better loss and expense ratio.
1Q23 GWP growth: SKWD GWP grew by 27.5% y/y (vs. our 16.8% estimate) helped by double-
digit premium growth in E&S, global property and agriculture, professional lines, surety and
captives underwriting divisions. The main drivers of the GWP growth were: (1) a doubling of E&S
premiums quarter-over-quarter due to higher submissions; (2) a >50% increase in surety; and (3)
higher renewal rates, new business opportunities, and an earlier renewal for a business that
was expected to renew in September in global property. In addition, the global agriculture and
inland marine units launched in 1Q contributed to the quarter.
Underwriting performance: SKWD's combined ratio was 90.2% vs. our estimate of 92.2%.
Expense ratio in 1Q23 of 27.4% (which excludes a ~1%-point impact of IPO related stock based
comp) was better than our estimate of 28.4% (also ex. IPO stock based comp) due to better than
expected commission and fee income. Accident Year Loss Ratio (AYLR), ex cats, LPT and non-
LPT, was 61.1% vs. our estimate of 62.8%. Total company Accident Year Combined Ratio (AYCR),
ex cats, LPT and non-LPT, was 88.5% vs. our 91.2% estimate.
Net Investment Income (NII): SKWD reported $4.6mn of net investment income vs. our
estimate of $6.5mn as the $3.1mn drag from opportunistic fixed income outweighed the
positive $6.3mn contribution from core fixed income. Opportunistic fixed income was impacted
due to a reduction in FMV of LLPs, not CRE related. In fact, office and retail within CRE
represents <3% of the portfolio. SKWD realized losses of $1.5mn (net of tax) related to SVB and
Signature Bank.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: For our $27 PT, we are using a 50/50 weighted 11.5x P/E multiple on our '24 EPS estimate and 1.8x P/TBV excluding AOCI on
our '24 TBV ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Greater variability of net investment income
stemming from its "opportunistic fixed income fund" (i.e. 19% of its investment portfolio and 60% of NII for YTD3Q22). This fund is originated and
managed by Arena, another Westaim subsidiary. Albeit, SKWD is winding down the opportunistic fixed income fund. Higher dependence on
reinsurance than established peers. SKWD is not immune to the secular challenges posed by the commercial auto insurance market (25% DPW for
YTD3Q22). SKWD was able to achieve sub 30% GWP growth in its core businesses over the last 2 years, with a notable step down in growth to sub 10%

funding future growth or back filling historical growth that had already consumed statutory capitalization.

Barclays Israeli branch previously held an investment marketing license with the Israel Securities Authority but it cancelled such license on 30/11/2014
as it solely provides its services to eligible clients pursuant to available exemptions under the Advisory Law, therefore a license with the Israel
