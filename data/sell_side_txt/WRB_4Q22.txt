Earnings Revised - January 26, 2023

W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
WRB: Burning the Q4 Oil; Q4 EPS and Conference Call Roundup
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
WRB reported Q4 2022 EPS of $1.16 beating our $1.04 and consensus of $1.10 driven
by higher investment income, lower cats, and a lower expense ratio partially offset by
weaker underlying margins, which were impacted 1-1.5 points of fire losses.
Estimate and price target changes: We are raising our 2023 to $5.05 (from $5.00)
to reflect modestly higher NII, modestly offset by a higher assumed repurchase price
while our 2024 estimate remains unchanged at $5.90. We are also initiating a 2025 EPS
estimate of $6.75. Our price target is unchanged at $85. While the shares are trading
down post earnings, we believe they offer a compelling valuation at 12x 2024 EPS, and
they should see good growth prospects in 2023.
The good: WRB delivered a record-high $231.3 million of investment income with both
fixed and non-fixed income beating our estimates. Their core fixed portfolio saw a yield of
3.49% in the quarter and should continue to provide a tailwind for earnings as new money
rates (near 5%) are still well above the embedded portfolio yield. The expense ratio ended
the year at 28.0%, down 50bps Y/Y, and was guided to being comfortably below 30% in
2023. Cats of 1.2 points beat our estimate of 2.2 points.
The bad: The 60.3% underlying loss ratio in insurance came in above our 59.0% estimate,
but in part was driven by 1-1.5 points of non-cat weather related to fires, which impacted
both insurance and reinsurance and will most likely be one-time in nature. They did
not provide a split on the impact, but if we assume about a point was in insurance, the
underlying loss ratio would have missed us more modestly.
The ugly: Gross premiums written growth was only 5.4%, well below our 12.0% estimate
(earned premiums beat us) and the slowest growth since Q2 2020, which shows WRB is
continuing to be disciplined in more competitive areas of the market (including D&O and
workers' comp). Their premiums written were also impacted 75bps by foreign currency
movement (dollar weakening) but still would have come in below our estimate. On the
positive side, Berkley pointed to growth starting 2023 strong in January.
The stock from here: Shares are trading down due to the underlying margin miss
and lower premium growth. Lost within that is WRB said they chose to add to their
catastrophe reinsurance exposure at 1/1. While still probably modest for them, we believe
cat reinsurance could provide an extra source of revenue and earnings in 2023. Further,
when we asked WRB about growth, they said that January was encouraging, which to us
points to growth picking up from the Q4 level.

Q4 2022 Beats On Investment Income, Lower Cats And Expenses
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q4 2022 EPS of $1.16, beating our $1.04 and consensus of $1.10. The
upside was driven by: (1) stronger net investment income (in the core portfolio and its investment
funds and arbitrage trading account), (2) lower cats (1.2 points versus our estimated 2.2 points),
(3) a lower expense ratio (27.8% versus our 28.0%), and (4) a lower tax rate (19.9% versus our
21.0%). Catastrophe losses came in at $30.8 million, lower than our $54.0 million estimate, and prior
year reserve development was $0.3 million favorable vs. our estimate for adverse development of
($0.5) million. WRB did not provide a split of the reserve release by segment (will be available in the
10K).Investment income came in at $231.3 million, well above our $177.0 million estimate, with both
their fixed and non-fixed income coming above us. There were FX losses of $34.1 million that offset
earnings by $0.10 per share.
The underlying combined ratio of 87.2% was worse than our 86.3% estimate, the underlying loss ratio
came 110bps above us, driven by 1-1.5 points of non-cat weather related to fires that occurred across
both insurance and reinsurance (they did not provide a breakdown between the two segments), which
more than offset a modestly favorable expense ratio (20bps above us). WRB bought back a modest
$87.6 million shares in the quarter (the highest repurchase since Q3 2021), higher than our $50 million
estimate. During the Q&A, they said the higher repurchase activity was not because there is a lack of
opportunities in the market. The operating ROE was 19.8%, and the net income ROE was 22.3%. Book
value per share grew 6.8% QoQ.

What the Companies Are Saying - WRB
Outlook. WRB said they are exceeding loss trend at this stage and there has not been a material
change in loss cost assumptions in the last 90 days. WRB said they are willing to lean in on the property
hard market in both insurance and reinsurance, but the growth won't be anything that will shift the
mix of the company. They are still seeing a healthy flow of business into the E&S market in both
casualty and property, despite standard markets continuing to be aggressive in their appetite with the
exception of large accounts product liability, which is not a huge exposure for them and has started to
revert back to standard markets.
Pricing. WRB saw rate of 6.9% (ex workers' comp), which was modestly down from the 7.3% last
quarter, but WRB said the rate remains ahead of loss trends. WRB was disappointed by the lack of
discipline in property as they mentioned many carriers failed to price in the higher reinsurance costs
that were awaiting at 1/1s and the lack of reinsurance capacity. On the workers' comp side, they
admitted they were off on their timing on when they expect pricing to harden, saying pricing should be
bumpy again this year before seeing considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given medical inflation
trends. WRB sees some of the brighter opportunities in umbrella and general liability excess with the
one cautious line being large account excess lines. Professional liability offers attractive opportunities
outside of D&O, which should continue to soften. In terms of reinsurance, they said the clock is right to
lean in but will see how much staying power and discipline there in the market. They mentioned they
are seeing more attractive returns in the US reinsurance market versus international. The exhibit below
shows recent commentary that WRB has provided on pricing since the start of 2020.
Guidance. WRB only provided guidance around the expense ratio, which they said should be
comfortably below 30.0% in 2023. WRB ended 2022 at a 28.0% expense ratio, so we believe a range of
28.0-28.5% is doable for 2023.
Investments. WRB saw record investment income of $231.3 million in the quarter as the core fixed
portfolio saw a yield of 3.49% in the quarter, above our 3.15% estimate and ended the year at a yield of
2.79%. Investment income should continue to be a tailwind for WRB as new money rates are still in the
4.5-5% range, and we are modeling a core portfolio yield of 3.67% in 2023, 3.86% in 2024, and 4.00%
in 2025.
Liquidity and Capital. WRB's debt to capital ratio ended 2022 at 29.6%, which was down from the
30.9% in Q3 and down from the 32.9% at the end of 2021. Repurchases in the quarter totaled $87.6
million, which was the highest repurchase activity this year and the highest since Q3 2021 when they
repurchased $93 million. During the Q&A, they noted the higher repurchase activity was not indicative
of a lack of opportunity in the marketplace to put capital to work.

Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period Pricing Comments
WRB said they were disappointed in the discipline in property pricing in the Q4 as they said many carriers failed to take into
account limited reinsurance capacity and higher reinsurance costs. They believe that property pricing should continue to improve i
as 2023 develops. For workers' comp, they said they missed the timing on when the market would begin to harden and they
expect pricing to be bumpy in 2023 with expectation for considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given severity trends,
particularly medical inflation. For auto, they said there is rate to be had but remains the most susceptible line to social inflation
and requires thought and judgement in underwriting for loss costs. Umbrella and general liability excess are amongst the brighter I
opportunities with one area on the cautious watchlist being large account excess lines. Professional liability is a tale of two stores
with D&O being pressured given the rising competitive landscape but other lines within professional liability should provide good
opportunities. WRB said they participated at 1/1 renewals and said the clock is right to lean in with good discipline with the US
offering more attractive returns than international.
Q4 2022
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers'
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Q3 2022
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to see
resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth target,
which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust. In
workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity and
erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from that.
Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable momentum,
up 45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing
is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something
measured in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious
and most of the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive
on WC pricing in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this
stage, particularly in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any current opportunities.
Q4 2021
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a
growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably attractive.
And we don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related
specialty writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and
even more so in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's
definitely encouraging.
Q3 2021

Period
Pricing Comments
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers;
compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been
factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate
increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year. The
simple fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that are available in
the business. And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about possibly how we re-prioritize exposure
of growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q2 2021
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the prior two being the
early 2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to
take advantage of the hardening market environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three
years, while most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the E&S
market, driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased audit
premiums; and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are at or approaching rate
adequacy with the exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the
example of professional liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more
recently and workers' comp is in a soft market.
June 2021
Non-Deal
Roadshow
(6/21/21)
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting meaningful rate increases.
And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many product lines where we have been getting rate on
rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.
The market is clearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think that is very appropriate. And
whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and 2002 and 2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is,
no cycle looks like any other cycle. When WRB looks at Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers'
compensation, is achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are seeing
meaningful firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella market, while property continues to be
notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL and but over the past couple of quarters that
seems to be building some momentum.
Q4 2020
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are becoming more acute. As far as workers'
compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is more likely than not to begin to firm as we make our way into 2021 or
sometime next year. The loss ratios that WRB selected at the beginning of the year assumed that they would not be outpacing
loss cost trend by the level that they are. The rate increases throughout the year, by and large, are above and beyond what was
anticipated. Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and specifically social inflation, WRB has deliberately decided to take a
wait-and-see attitude.
Q3 2020
We saw the firm market accelerate throughout 2019 and it continued to accelerate into 2020, very evident in Q1. The evidence of
this was demonstrated, at least in part by business leaving the standard market, making its way to the specialty market and in
particular, the E&S market. Rate increases were at a level not seen in some number of years and there was a reduction in
capacity that various carriers were offering. All of these things were being driven by two major factors: (1) low interest rate
environment and a knock-on effect for what that means for investment income; and (2) loss cost trends, driven to a great extent
by social inflation, which had been benign for an extended period of time and then crept up on the industry when it was least
expecting it and it has proven to be much more of an issue.

The exhibit below shows WRB's pricing trends (excluding Workers' Compensation) relative to
MarketScout since 2017. In Q4, WRB's rate (ex. WC) was 6.9% vs. MarketScout of 5.1%. This compares
to Q3 WRB rate of 7.3%, Q2 2022 WRB rate of 6.8%, Q1 2022 of 8.3% and the 2021 average rate
of 10.5%. WRB did not want to provide too much color by business line in terms of what drove the
sequential deceleration in pricing, but says the 6.9% is still ahead of loss trends, and their loss trend
assumptions have not changed materially over the last 90 days.

Summary of Estimate Changes
Estimates mostly unchanged. See below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q4
2022 earnings. Following WRB's conference call, we are modestly raising our 2023 EPS estimate to
$5.05 from $5.00, while our 2024 estimate remains unchanged at $5.90. We are also initiating an
EPS of $6.75 for 2025. Our forward numbers for 2023 were raised modestly to account for higher
investment income as WRB reinvests its portfolio at higher yields. Currently, we model a core fixed
income portfolio yield for 2023 and 2024 of 3.67% and 3.86%, respectively, vs. the fixed income yield
in the quarter of 3.49%

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB trades at 2.80x Q4 2022 book value, which compares to the 5-year and
10-year average multiples of 2.06x and 1.73x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 1.42x and 10-
year minimum is 1.11x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 2.99x, which is where the shares are currently
trading, although we note that for the P&C sector price-to-book valuations are fuller given the
unrealized losses we have seen in this rising interest rate environment. For WRB, we exclude AOCI, the
shares are trading at just around 2.35x adjusted Q4 book. On a P/E basis, WRB is trading at 12.1x our
2024 EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year average multiples of 18.5x
and 16.9x, respectively. It is above the 5-year minimum, which is 12.9x (during the low point of the
pandemic) and above the 10-year minimum of 10.4x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 25.0x.

Equity Research
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases in
2023, particularly as they lean in on property insurance and reinsurance, which should translate into a good level of premium growth and
underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $85.00 from NC
Our price target of $85 is based on a 2.4x multiple of our year-end 2024 book value estimate. Our price target also represents a ~ 14.4x
multiple against our 2023 EPS estimate. The 14.4x is a premium to the standard commercial players as WRB should see better growth.
Further, it is a discount to its peak historical multiples, further supporting the choice of multiple in our view.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe and/or Covid-19 losses.

W.R. Berkley Corporation
Equity Research
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
