2Q23 Earnings Review: Auto pressure
persists
HIG needs back-to-back years of about 20 pts of auto rate
increases in '23 and '24 to achieve targeted profitability in early
'25. The commercial pricing vs "stable" loss trend commentary
points to margin expansion. Earned premiums in 2H should
benefit from rate compounding.

We have been cautious about auto for 3 years. We think HIG is being realistic about the need to
take greater rate in auto through '23 and '24. However, we are concerned that some regulators
will experience fatigue, we are already seeing that in smaller states like GA and NC. The industry
just has not been tested under a sticky inflationary environment so prior playbooks (i.e., 2015-
2017) just do not work. HIG cited both sticky inflation pressures on physical damage as well as
cautious views on bodily injury. Our view of the industry approaching rate adequacy for auto is
late '24 (a tad earlier than HIG's early '25.) However, HIG's balanced business mix and niche type
of focus on AARP means it is less weighted on auto.
Auto underlying combined ratio was 111.8%, up 11.8 pts y/y and was 5 pts above HIG's revised
expectations shared on the 1Q earnings call (~4 - 6 points pressure on the FY2023 auto loss ratio
if inflation doesn't abate). The 111.8% underlying auto combined ratio also includes 3 pts of
inter-quarter adjustments (on 1Q). HIG is seeing a higher than anticipated number of large
bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims.

We don't consider HIG an outlier on PFAS as the company tends to write smaller policies.
However, it is less comforting that older policies do not have explicit PFAS exclusions. HIG has a
$256mn limit remaining on its A&E ADC with BRK which could cover the pollution portion but
not the bodily injury piece of PFAS. However, in our 4Q22 earnings note we wrote that HIG could
see some ADC recovery in 2024 with full gross A&E losses materializing in core earnings starting
in 2025. However, we think HIG has a buffer in its WC reserves that could fortify its reserve
position. We held an expert webinar on PFAS (Replay & Takeaways: Expert Meeting Emerging
Risk and Mass Litigation Toll 22 June 2023). While this risk is not new, in our view, it is a risk that
may be shifting from "emerging" to "emerged" and industry insured losses could be larger than
asbestos (which was $100-130bn according to Milliman).

"Stable" loss cost trends is a longer term view: Medical severity trends have been lower than the
5% per its pricing/reserving assumptions. At the same time HIG is including variables that it may
not be seeing as much today but is considered in long term trends like social inflation, propelled
by litigation financing, in its reserves. We are not expecting the loss cost environment to

for further rate increases.
Elevated Non-Cat Losses within Commercial and $5mn of losses in run-off lines, aviation, and
international added 0.5 points to the underlying combined ratio of 88.3%. HIG experienced
worse non-cat losses within small commercial somewhat offset by more favorable non-cat
losses within Middle & Large Commercial.

HIG has sound fundamentals
following transformation, which
should continue to drive a stronger
book multiple. ROE convergence
with peers should make current
valuation look inexpensive.
Navigators acquisition is becoming
more accretive given boost from
hard pricing in specialty lines. HIG
has accelerated the pace of its
expense savings plans.
Upside case

Our upside case reflects stronger
than expected underwriting margin
expansion and commercial P&C
pricing levels and improving group
benefits margins. Our upside case is
~1.5x '24 BVPS ex AOCI.
Downside case
USD 65.00
Our downside case assumes
unsuccessful underwriting margin
expansion and expense savings as
well as a slowdown in the
commercial P&C renewal rate

Personal Lines - Rates, Underlying Margins, and PIF
Auto rates. In 2Q23, auto written price increases were 13.8% (up from 9.9% last quarter). HIG
mentioned it needs back-to-back years of about 20 pts of auto rate increases in '23 and '24 to
achieve targeted profitability in early '25. We believe both written rates and approved rates will
take time to earn in, especially considering that the bulk of HIG's policies are 12 months (though
more recent marketing efforts for Prevail are centered on 6-month policies).
Auto underlying combined ratio deteriorated sequentially to 111.8% in 2Q23 from 105.1% in
1Q23, and deteriorated vs. 100% in 2Q22. The auto underlying combined ratio for 2Q was 5 pts
above HIG's revised expectations shared on the 1Q earnings call (~4 - 6 points pressure on the
FY2023 auto loss ratio if inflation doesn't abate.) Likewise, the 111.8% underlying auto
combined ratio also includes 3 pts of inter-quarter adjustments (on 1Q). HIG is seeing a higher
than anticipated number of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims.
Homeowners rates. HIG continues to push for rate with a 14.4% written rate increase in 2Q23
(up from 13.9% last quarter) that is the combination of higher rate and inflation guard. HIG
believes its homeowners pricing is better than lost trends.
Homeowners underlying combined ratio was within HIG's expectations but deteriorated to
79.6% in 2Q23 from 78.9% in 1Q23 though improved from 82.0% in 2Q22.
The underlying loss ratio for Personal Lines increased to 76.1% in 2Q23 from 70.5% in 1Q23 and
65.7% in 2Q22. The expense ratio improved by 2.7 pts y/y due to lower marketing spend.
Policies in Force (PIF) slightly down. PIF declined (1.4)% q/q for Auto (vs. down 1.4% q/q last
quarter) and (1.1)% for Homeowners (down 1.2% q/q last quarter). Auto policy count retention
for auto increased sequentially (86% in 2Q23 vs. 85% for 1Q23) despite price increases, which
may mean that HIG could be charging even more for auto. IR explained to us the inverse
movement between PIF growth and retention is explained by less new business. We view this
PIF decline in auto positively as it means HIG is not actively growing a loss leading LOB.

Commercial Lines - Spotlight on Rates and
Underlying Margins
The commercial pricing vs "stable" loss trend commentary points to margin expansion. Earned
premiums in 2H should benefit from rate compounding. Next, business mix should improve
margins as HIG is expecting property to become a larger piece. Lastly, HIG is forecasting a better
expense ratio in 2H23.
Commercial underlying combined ratio of 88.3% in 2Q23 includes 0.5 pts of less trendable items
(non-cat, aviation losses, run-off, etc.) If we normalize that piece, HIG's underlying commercial
combined ratio improved ~80 bps sequentially.
Commercial Lines pricing ex workers' compensation (WC) is re-accelerating slightly to 7.5% in
2Q23 from 6.8% in 1Q23 and 6.6% in 4Q22. Property pricing was well into the double digits with
commercial auto in the high single digits. WC pricing remained slightly positive while public
D&O pricing remains challenged.

Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio of 88.3% (0.2 point improvement q/q and 0.2
point deterioration y/y) is at the middle of management's full-year 2023 guidance range of 87%-
89%. Within commercial, small commercial underlying combined ratio is now higher than
middle & large and global specialty. Middle & large commercial benefited from favorable non-
cat. Broken down by segment:
· Middle & Large Commercial underlying combined ratio of 89.7% in 2Q23 improved from
89.9% in 1Q23.
· Small Commercial underlying combined ratio at 89.7% in 2Q23 deteriorated from 89.5% in

Group Benefits
Core earnings margin of 7.6% is better than our estimate of 7.1% and ahead of the company's
6%-7% target range for 2023. Group Benefits loss ratio deteriorated to 72.1% from 70.1% y/y.
Group life loss ratio deteriorated to 84.1% from 78.6% y/y; recall in 2Q22 HIG released $24mn of
IBNR. Recall, HIG expects excess mortality losses to improve y/y in 2023 yet stabilize above pre-
pandemic levels, and is pricing accordingly.

1H23 vs. FY2023 Target Financial Plan
We track 1H23 progression against full-year 2023 guidance:
· HIG's personal lines underlying CR of 99.4% in 1H23. In April, management implied a higher
guide for underlying combined ratio in FY2023 than what it shared in February (of 93%-95%)
with the auto loss ratio potentially rising 4 to 6 pts higher than management's target for the
full year.
. Commercial lines underlying CR of 88.4% in 1H23 was at the high end of the 2023 guide of
87%-89%.
· Group Benefits core earnings margin for 1H23 came in at 6.4%, in line with the company's
6%-7% target range for 2023.
. Core ROE of 13.6% vs. management's 14-15% target for 2023. We forecast 13.6% for 2023
and 14.4% for 2024. HIG reiterated meeting its target this year.

Forward-Looking Commentary/Model Updates
· HIG reiterated meeting its 14-15% ROE for 2023. We are modeling 13.6% amid auto
pressures.
· Private equity returns resilient, on track to achieve full year target of 4-6%.
· Commercial Lines earned premiums to increase 2H23 from rate compounding. Likewise
commercial lines expense ratio to improve in 2H23.
. Auto. HIG mentioned it needs back-to-back years of about 20 pts of auto rate increases in
'23 and '24 to achieve targeted profitability in early '25.
. Office CML: During 2Q two loans were fully repaid for ~$90mn. HIG believes 2H23 & FY2024
maturities are manageable.

We reiterate our Overweight rating on HIG. Our $83 (from $87) price target on HIG is based on
a 50/50 weighted 9.5x (unchanged) '24E EPS and 1.3x (unchanged) 2024E book value per share
ex AOCI. We lowered our estimates on personal auto performance, somewhat tempered by an
improved outlook on commercial underlying margin expansion.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $83 price target on HIG is based on a 50/50 weighted 9.5x '24E EPS and 1.3x 2024E book value per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
