MI & Reinsurance Tailwinds to Drive Strong Results
ACGL's results exceeded expectations, as upside in the MI and reinsurance
businesses offset downside in insurance. We are Neutral on the stock due to
valuation but consider Arch a premier franchise and feel that ACGL is the best
name for investors seeking to take advantage of the hard reinsurance market.
· EPS upside; raising estimates. ACGL reported 4Q23 operating EPS of $2.49,
well above our $1.97 estimate and consensus of $2.00. Results benefited from
lower attritional losses, which more than offset slightly higher expenses.
Compared to our model, the upside was driven partly by more favorable prior-
year development (+$0.03 variance), but this was more than offset by higher
cat losses (-$0.07 variance). Investment income was $0.06 better as well, and
should continue to increase at a strong pace. We are raising our 2024 EPS
forecast from $7.36 to $7.76 to reflect better reinsurance and MI margins.
· Business trends were strong overall. Reinsurance results were lifted by
strong margins (CR 80.1% vs. our 82.9% estimate) and healthy premium
growth (ex. one-time deals last year). As in recent quarters, MI results were
lifted by robust margins (CR -3.3% vs. 32.0%E), helped by sizable releases of
post-COVID reserves (-39.0% on CR vs. - 12.0%E). Insurance margins were
strong in an absolute sense, but fell short of our estimate (CR 93.2% vs.
91.4%E; CR ex. cats and PYD 89.9% vs. 89.7%E) due to higher than expected
cat losses and an uptick in the expense ratio. Premiums exceeded expectation
as well (NWP +7.5% vs. +1.5%E) as upside in the reinsurance and insurance
businesses offset a shortfall in MI. As assumed, ACGL did not repurchase stock
in 4Q. Management sounded very positive on the operating environment in the
property cat reinsurance and MI markets, but less so on casualty pricing.
. Our model projects ACGL to report robust results in the near term, but
our long-term outlook is mixed. In our view, Arch will report strong margins
and top-line growth in re/insurance, and healthy margins but poor premium
growth in MI. In the MI business, reserve releases related to COVID
delinquencies should moderate, but we anticipate ongoing favorable
development given the strong labor market and the rise in house prices. Higher
interest rates are a headwind for growth, but should help premium persistency
and margins in the MI division. In reinsurance, margins should benefit from
firm pricing. Still, we remain skeptical of a sustained hard market in the
reinsurance business. Our model assumes no share repurchases over the next
few quarters given ACGL's current stock price and management's intent to
deploy capital into the business amid the favorable pricing backdrop.
JPMorgan
. We reiterate our Neutral rating. In our view, ACGL is a top-tier franchise,
but in commoditized markets. While the company is well-positioned to benefit
from hard reinsurance pricing, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance
market is cautious. Also, we feel that ACGL's valuation is not attractive given
its long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We reiterate our Neutral rating. Arch is a leading re/insurance
franchise with a track record of higher and less volatile
underwriting margins than most peers. Still, we are Neutral
because of our cautious long-term outlook for the P&C
reinsurance market and the stock's valuation. In our view, near-
term results in the MI business will be marked by weak premium
growth and moderating margins as attritional loss ratios
normalize higher, partially offset by continued reserve release
from post-COVID accident years. Over time, we expect MI
returns to be held back by the commoditized nature of the
product, black box pricing, and higher capital requirements. In
P&C reinsurance, hard pricing and tighter terms/conditions
should boost underwriting results in the near term, but our long-
term outlook is negative as we remain skeptical of a sustained
hard market.

We consider ACGL the best stock for those seeking to invest on the hard
reinsurance pricing theme, but are Neutral due to valuation. In our view, ACGL is
an industry-leading reinsurance franchise with a unique culture and approach to
underwriting that should generate above-average, and less volatile, margins over time.
Arch is also a leading mortgage insurer, a business that we believe is structurally better
than P&C reinsurance. We expect ACGL's reinsurance results to remain strong into
2024 given the market's discipline on pricing and terms/conditions. In primary P&C,
ACGL has gained share and expanded margins, especially in E&S. In the MI business,
margins should moderate from their abnormally high levels recently, but stay strong
overall, while premium growth is likely to be weak. Despite optimism on near-term
results, our long-term outlook is less upbeat and we anticipate a turn in pricing if
reinsurers' margins sustain at recent levels over the next 1-2 years. The reinsurance
market suffers from structural issues such as low barriers to entry, lack of differentiation
among carriers, and limited pricing power, and we expect sustained robust results to
drive softening of terms/conditions. Still, our overall view of ACGL is positive and we
could get more bullish if the stock pulls back.
P&C Reinsurance: Near-Term Outlook Upbeat; L-T Cautious
Arch's near-term reinsurance margins should benefit from hard pricing and
tighter terms, but our long-term outlook is cautious. The company has historically
generated better and less volatile margins than most reinsurers, which we attribute to its
focus on specialty business (where pricing tends to be less competitive), conservative
underwriting, ability to shift mix based on changing conditions, and judicious
management of catastrophe risk. In particular, ACGL prices business using the risk-free
rate (leading to more conservative underwriting) and uses a long-term compensation
plan for underwriters based on margins over a multi-year period. Furthermore, the
creation of 3rd party capital vehicles such as Premia Re generates fee income for the
company. Overall, we consider Arch a top-tier reinsurer and expect firm pricing to boost
results through 2024. Still, our long-term outlook for reinsurance is cautious given its
commoditized nature, the ease of entry of new capital, and a broad set of capital
providers (including some, such as pension funds, with lower return thresholds). We are
skeptical of prolonged hard pricing and believe that 1-2 years of strong margins will
erode pricing discipline. Any signs of softening of terms/conditions or capacity entering
the market would likely hurt sentiment on reinsurance stocks, which have become
consensus longs since late 2022.
MI: Margins to Revert to More Normal Levels, Growth Weak
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance through acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and United
Guaranty in 2016) when market conditions were favorable, marked by appreciating
home prices, stringent lending standards at mortgage issuers, and disciplined pricing by
mortgage insurers. Arch's MI business has generated healthy margins since then and,
despite the temporary setback from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have
been strong. We expect MI margins, which have been unsustainably strong, to revert
lower to more normal levels as COVID-related reserve releases taper off. However,
ACGL's more conservative loss picks post-COVID could lead to near-term upside. The
strong labor market and elevated home prices are also supportive of margins. Higher
interest rates are a headwind for new sales, but should boost persistency.

4Q23 Details
This evening, ACGL reported fourth quarter 2023 operating EPS of $2.49, significantly
above our $1.97 estimate and consensus of $2.00 as lower attritional losses more than
offset slightly higher expenses. Compared to our model, the EPS upside was driven
partly by more favorable prior-year development (+$0.03 variance), while cat losses
were higher than assumed (-$0.07 variance). Also, investment income was $0.06 better
than assumed. By division, upside in the MI and reinsurance businesses offset downside
in insurance.

Business trends were strong overall. Reinsurance results were lifted by strong margins
(CR 80.1% versus our 82.9% estimate) and healthy premium growth (adjusted for one-
time deals last year). As in recent quarters, MI results were lifted by robust margins (CR
-3.3% vs. 32.0%E), helped by sizable releases of non-COVID reserves (-39.0% on CR
vs. - 12.0%E). Insurance margins were strong in an absolute sense, but fell short of our
estimate (CR 93.2% vs. 91.4%E; CR ex. cats and PYD 89.9% vs. 89.7%E) due to higher
than expected cat losses and an uptick in the expense ratio. Premium growth was better
than anticipated as well (NWP +7.5% vs. +1.5%E) as upside in the reinsurance and
insurance businesses offset a shortfall in MI. As assumed, Arch did not repurchase stock
in the fourth quarter.

Mortgage Insurance: Results Lifted by Reserve Releases
In our view, mortgage insurance (MI) will be marked by weak premium growth,
high persistency, and strong (but normalizing) margins. Higher interest rates should
suppress mortgage insurance volumes, while reserve releases from cures of COVID-
related delinquencies should moderate. Still, division results have been significantly
better than assumed in recent quarter and that was the case in 4Q23. The MI division
reported underwriting income of $286 million in 4Q23, well above our $187 million
estimate, driven by upside in margins (CR -3.3% vs. 32.0%E). Earned premiums were
weak, but higher than anticipated (-5.9% from 4Q22 vs. - 8.6%E). The upside in margins
was due to greater than assumed favorable reserve releases (-39.0% vs. - 12.0%E) as
well as a lower attritional loss ratio (18.3% vs. 24.0%E). Consistent with commentary
after 3Q23 results, management attributed the reserve releases to better than expected
cure rates and more favorable assumptions (lower average per claim reserve and lower
ultimate loss per notice of default) for business issued in accident years 2020-2022.
Meanwhile, attritional losses benefited from lower estimated claim rates, partially offset
by a modest uptick in new delinquencies. Similar to the recent trend, top-line growth in
the MI market remains sluggish, with net written premiums declining for 9 consecutive
quarters. We expect factors that are boosting margins in the business (higher rates, lower
inventory of houses, etc.) to continue to suppress top-line growth in the MI division.
In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were hurt by artificially high delinquencies caused
by homeowners availing themselves of government forbearance programs. However,

after an initial spike in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has steadily declined. With
the expiry of the forbearance programs, a significant portion of previously delinquent
loans has cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were taking advantage of the
mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial distress. Meanwhile, higher house
prices have provided a cushion to homeowners under stress who are struggling to pay
their mortgages, limiting losses for MI carriers. The percent of loans in default in the
U.S. primary MI business inched up slightly from 1.65% at 9/30/23 to 1.74% at
12/31/23, but remains low overall.

In our view, MI margins will continue to benefit from reserve releases, but to a
lesser extent than in recent quarters. Higher reported delinquencies at the onset of
COVID led Arch and its MI peers to establish corresponding reserves despite the
healthy labor market and appreciation in house prices. A meaningful portion of these
delinquencies was due to homeowners taking advantage of the government's
forbearance protection programs (to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship.
Under U.S. GAAP accounting, Arch had to establish reserves based on reported
delinquencies despite the high likelihood that the delinquencies would eventually cure
(unlike other P&C lines an IBNR component is disallowed under U.S. GAAP for
primary MI business). With most of these delinquent loans curing following the
expiration of forbearance programs (initially set for 12/31/20, but then extended through
9/30/21 and, in some cases, year-end 2021 or beyond), ACGL has been releasing these
previously incurred reserves. Currently, more than 80% of MI reserves are from
accident years after COVID, suggesting less of a benefit from the release of reserves
related to COVID delinquencies. Despite an expected decline, we project MI margins to
remain healthy given the strong labor and housing markets, cures on previously
delinquent loans, and the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due to the
appreciation in house prices. Higher interest rates are a positive for margins as well, as
they are resulting in homeowners' staying in their existing houses (where they have
more equity) longer then typical and are thereby improving persistency in the MI book.
On a cautious note, top-line growth is likely to be weak as higher interest rates reduce
mortgage originations. While a weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead to
higher mortgage defaults, a material uptick in losses seems unlikely in the near term.
Barring a recession, we expect core margins to stay healthy, though declining reserve
releases will drive margins and earnings lower even if economic trends stay favorable.

ACGL has become a leading competitor in the MI market through acquisitions and
could expand further via M&A, although deals seem unlikely in the near term.
ACGL entered the mortgage re/insurance business in 2011 but was only marginally
involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit
unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The company's
2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger
foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P)
and gained distribution in the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch became a top 10
competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market position strengthened
further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which
catapulted it to a top-3 spot (as part of the deal AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance
blocks originated by UGC pre 2017). Arch has also expanded in foreign MI markets
through M&A, including its acquisition of Westpac's mortgage insurance business in
Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Weaker Margins Offset Robust Premiums
The insurance business reported lower than assumed underwriting margins, but
robust premium growth, contrary to the trend in the previous quarter. The division
generated underwriting income of $99 million in 4Q23, short of our $121 million
estimate, due to lower than expected margins (CR 93.2% vs. 91.4%E). Margins were
suppressed by higher than anticipated cat losses (3.8% on CR versus 2.0%E), but missed
our assumption on a core basis as well (CR ex. cats and PYD 89.9% vs. 89.7%E).
Meanwhile, premium growth was strong on both a net written (+19.1% vs. +12.5%E)
and earned basis (+16.5% vs. +12.6%E). Management attributed the strong premium
growth to new accounts, increased volumes from existing accounts, and price increases.
Favorable pricing conditions and the rise in reinsurance costs prompted the company to
retain more business than in the past.

Arch's primary P&C business is benefiting from favorable pricing, but we expect
margin improvement in the business to be less than implied by price hikes. After
shrinking its "cycle managed" business (now called as wholesale/large capacity) from
2012 to 2017, ACGL is seeing strong growth in this part of its primary book, driven by
price hikes in the broader market, particularly in E&S. Results in less opportunistic parts
of ACGL's book (specialty small/middle market and franchise) have been healthy as

well. High inflation and rising reinsurance costs are driving an uptick in insurance
pricing, especially in property and cat-exposed lines. Despite the increase in prices, we
do not anticipate a material improvement in primary commercial lines margins at Arch
and peers due to headwinds from higher inflation and reinsurance costs. Management
teams at insurance underwriters as well as many investors are optimistic about
improving non-cat margins at commercial insurers, but we feel that assessing results
on a non-cat basis is not as relevant given the significant increase in reinsurance
retentions at primary companies. On an overall combined ratio basis, results for most
primary insurers were weak in 2023 given elevated cat losses. In contrast, reinsurers' cat
losses have not increased to the same extent. We feel that consensus EPS forecasts for
commercial lines insurers do not adequately reflect the shift in cat loads from reinsurers
to primary carriers following the uptick in retention levels with 1/1/2023 reinsurance
renewals.
Reinsurance: Robust Margins Lifted Results
The reinsurance business reported strong margins and premium growth, consistent
with the trends in recent quarters. The business reported underwriting income of
$330 million in 4Q23, considerably above our $274 million assumption, helped by
upside in margins. The combined ratio was 80.1% in 4Q23 versus our 82.9%
assumption as lower attritional losses (48.5% vs. 57.9%E) offset slightly less favorable
reserve development (-1.3% vs. - 5.3%E) and an uptick in the acquisition expense ratio
(22.5% vs. 21.0%E). ACGL attributed the uptick in the acquisition expense ratio to
business mix, not a change in market dynamics. Gross written premiums were weaker
than expected (+9.7% vs. +15.0%E), but were healthy nonetheless. Net written premium
were flat, but this was more due to a few non-recurring transactions in 4Q22, absent
which they would have increased 25.6%. Management sounded upbeat on Arch's
positioning amid capacity constraints in the property cat market. The increase in
reinsurance attachment points in early 2023 shifted the risk of cat losses from reinsurers
to primary carriers and management indicated that terms remained fairly consistent with
1/1/24 renewals. Conversely, contrary to its initial expectation, management has not
seen a marked improvement in pricing and terms in the casualty market.

positioned than peers in the current environment. ACGL's reinsurance segment was
initially established to take advantage of the hard market for casualty coverage in the
early 2000s. Over the years, however, management has shifted Arch Re's business mix
away from casualty risks towards other specialty lines such as surety, accident and
health, agriculture, and trade credit, which are generally less competitive and have more
attractive risk-reward. The hard pricing environment has boosted results in recent years
and is causing management to increase its exposure to property coverages. This, in turn,
should drive continued strong premiums and margins in the near term. Still, we expect
the pace of price hikes to moderate longer term and remain skeptical of a sustained hard
reinsurance market. Factors that contributed to a multi-year soft market prior to 2018
(glut of capital, greater fluidity/speed of capital, more providers of capacity, broker
consolidation) are still prevalent, and should preclude prolonged hard pricing. On a
positive note, ACGL's reinsurance results could benefit from the release of COVID-
related reserves, a portion of which remain in IBNR. Similarly, loss reserves for Ian
could ultimately prove to be too conservative (most reinsurers booked higher Ian-related
losses than primary carriers).
Raising EPS Estimates
We are increasing our 2024 EPS forecast from $7.36 to $7.76. Our revised model
reflects higher than previously assumed margins in the reinsurance and MI businesses.
We consider catastrophe losses (which would affect reinsurance and insurance margins)
and housing market conditions (which affect MI margins and premium growth) the key
sources of potential variance in reported results and our projections.

Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $88.00)
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premier re/insurance franchise, but bullish investor sentiment and
valuation keep us from being more positive on the stock. Arch is a leading reinsurance
business that we project to report superior and less volatile underwriting margins over time
because of its unique culture and approach to the market. Also, Arch is a top competitor in
mortgage insurance (MI), which we consider structurally better business than P&C
reinsurance. In the near term, we expect MI results to be marked by weak premium growth
and compressing, albeit still healthy, margins as loss ratios normalize. In reinsurance, firm
pricing should boost both premium growth and margins in the immediate future. However,
our long-term view of the reinsurance business is cautious. The reinsurance business suffers
from structural issuer such as low barriers to entry, lack of differentiation by carrier, and
limited pricing power. As such, we expect sustained high margins to erode price discipline
and attract additional capacity into the market. Lastly, investor sentiment on ACGL is
bullish and the stock's valuation is not compelling relative to the company's long-term ROE
and EPS growth potential.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2024 price target from $80 to $88 to reflect our higher EPS
and book value forecasts. Our price target assumes a 1.5x multiple on our 12/31/24E BV ex.
AOCI forecast, a 1.6x multiple on our 12/31/24E BV forecast, and an 11.0x multiple on our
2025 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach with a sum-of-the-parts analysis that
values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from mortgage insurance. Our target
multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix, which has become less skewed to
mortgage insurance. ACGL trades at 1.9x BV and 10.8x 2024E EPS compared to 1.2x and
6.2x for the reinsurance sector, 1.1x and 7.9x for MI peers, and 1.9x and 12.4x for the broader
P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for an extended period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. In
our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, even as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· Additional capacity enters the reinsurance market. This, in turn, could result in a
reversal in pricing trends and potentially drive a reduction in EPS estimates as well as
hurt sentiment on the sector.
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development has
been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in the pace
of development could pressure margins and returns.

this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
