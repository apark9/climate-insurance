Price Target Change - January 22, 2025
Commercial Lines Insurance
The Travelers Companies, Inc.
A Sunny Quarter, but Still See Rain Showers; Conference
Call Roundup
Our Call
Travelers traded up on the print and strong margins across all segments and there was no
GL reserve movement called out. Although we do note it was a strong quarter, at 10.5x
2026 EPS, we see better opportunities in the sector. Remain Underweight.
The stock from here: TRV got a nice bounce today and from here we think movement
will depend on how it looks relative to others. We remain cautious on 2025 due to: (1)
we believe the 6.9 pt planned cat load (ex CA) is low and CA should be a meaningful hit
to Q1 earnings, (2) a tougher y/y setup on margins given 2024 benefited from favorable
non-cat weather and pricing is moderating, and (3) continued volatility in casualty picks /
reserves as TRV added to casualty IBNR again in Q4.
Mixed estimate changes, price target goes up: Our 2025E EPS goes down to $18.05
(from $20.55), primarily reflecting CA wildfire losses in Q1 (we include $1.1b CA fire
losses as we haircut TRV's market share in the state), while 2026E EPS estimate goes up
to $23.65 (from $22.35) reflecting better underlying margin in personal lines / BI and
higher NII. We introduce an initial 2027 EPS of $26.50. Our PT is $225 (from $213) as we
shift it to be based on 9.5x our '26 EPS (vs '25 previously).
CA wildfire and reinsurance thoughts: We update our Q1 to include our initial estimate
of $1,140m of fire losses (based on a 15% haircut of implied 2023 homeowners' market
share). On positive side for TRV, they have an aggregate XOL cover that provides recovery
of up to $3.675b in excess of a $4.0b retention ($100m deductible for each occurrence).
Although we still think their 6.9% planned cat load for 2025 is low (we were looking for
7.5pts pre CA wildfires), reinsurance provides a ceiling.
Read-throughs: (1) Q4 pricing remained relatively stable in both small and middle
market, (2) lower Milton losses for the industry vs original expectations could be offset
by adverse development on Helene losses, as TRV saw $60m of Milton losses vs initial
$75-175m guide, while Helene developed adversely (by ~$100m), (3) TRV added to
casualty picks, which we could see from others as well, and (4) Q4 underlying personal
auto and home margins should be strong for the grouo.
Reserves / loss pick color: TRV released $147m in BI, driven by ~$250m of workers'
comp releases partially offset by adverse development in abuse/molestation. TRV added
a little IBNR to the casualty line again and increased their casualty reinsurance protection,
which to us highlights the continued volatility expected in casualty picks in 2025 and one
of the reasons we downgraded the stock at the end of last year. For more details, see our
conference call recap note and first look note here.

Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV shares could underperform as (1) they face
liability reserve volatility, (2) tough comps in BI and personal lines
underlying margins in 2025 as personal auto pricing moderates and
2024 saw favorable non-cat weather, and (3) a potentially higher
cat load vs what is currently baked in from the Street. In addition,
Our rating is Underweight.

Base Case | $225.00
. Our price target of $225 is based on
9.5x our 2026 EPS estimate. We come
to the 9.5x multiple based on a 5%
discount to the peer group of AIG, CB,
and HIG (currently trading at 10.0x).
· Implies around a ~1.5x multiple of our
projected 2026 book value estimate of
~$151.
Upside Scenario | $259.00
. Our upside scenario is $259 and
assumes a multiple of ~10.9x our 2026
EPS estimate and ~1.7x our 2026 book
value estimate of ~$151.
A continued firm commercial pricing
environment with no material changes
to loss cost trends / loss picks
· No material reserve additions
. Cat load in line with or better than the
Street
· Strong level of buybacks
Downside Scenario | $203.00
·
Our downside scenario is $203 and is
based on 8.6x our 2026 EPS estimate
and ~1.35x our 2026 book value
estimate of ~$151.
.
Material softening in the RRC,
particularly in BI
· Higher-than-expected cat load
· Loss cost trends rise, and we see further
additions to reserves as well as an uptick
in loss picks (especially within general
liability)
Upcoming Catalysts
· Commercial pricing survey data from MarketScout and Ivans,
which track movement in rate across various commercial lines,
including workers' compensation
· Updated CA wildfire industry loss estimates as well potential
disclosed losses from peer
· Commentary from other peers around loss cost trends,
reserves, and rate adequacy in lines including commercial and
personal insurance lines

What the Companies Are Saying - TRV
Outlook
TRV did not provide a preliminary estimate for wildfires, but noted they have two policies they sell
in California with (1) being their standard Quantum product, which includes wildfire protection, and
(2) their DIC policy, which excludes losses from wildfire, with most customers bundling that policy
with a FAIR plan policy. When asked about their appetite for $5m homes in California, they noted their
exposure is limited, as they are not a significant player in the high net worth space. TRV noted they
are actively pursuing auto growth and will continue to do so despite some risk from the potential of
tariffs. TRV noted there were not any one-off items to call out in BI's underlying loss ratio, while home
and auto benefited from favorable prior quarter re-estimates, as well as favorable non-cat weather (in
home).
Pricing
The Business Insurance RRC was 6.9% in the quarter (decelerating modestly from 7.2% in Q3), with
renewal rate increases in umbrella and auto both well into double digits and both up sequentially from
a third quarter. Rate increases in CMP and GL remain strong and generally in line with third-quarter
levels, while the rate increases in property were less than Q3 with the moderation in property driven
by their national book, where returns are very strong. For Select (small business product), RRC was
5.6%, which ticked up from the Q3 with some moderation in retention as they continue to intentionally
optimize their CMP risk return profile in a few targeted geographies. In middle market, the rate
increases remain broad-based, with positive rate change in 80% of their middle market accounts. In
auto, RPC was 10.2% (vs 12.8% in Q3) and should continue to moderate as profitability improves. For
home, RPC was 14.1%, modestly down from 14.4% in Q3 and is expected to accelerate to the high
teens in 2025.
Guidance
Guidance was provided around investment income (see section below). TRV said they are comfortable
with the annual expense ratio at this level (28.5% in FY 2024) in 2025. TRV enhanced their casualty
reinsurance program at 1/1, as they were able to purchase more coverage at a lower attachment point
on a roughly margin-neutral basis, which will affect the growth rate of consolidated NPW for full-year
2025 by less than 0.5 points. For the Q1, the impact will be more pronounced with a 4 point headwind
expected for BI NPW growth and about 2 points on a consolidated basis. TRV also introduced a pretax
cat load of 6.9 pts for full-year 2025, but did caveat that was before any California wildfire losses.
Investments
TRV modestly raised its net investment income guide and is looking for after-tax net investment
income from fixed income portfolio to $3.0b for FY 2025 from $2.9b with $710m in Q1 (vs $700m
previously) to $790m in Q4 (from $760m previously).
Liquidity and Capital
TRV bought back $252m of shares in the Q4, consistent with the past few quarters, leaving $5.0b of
capacity remaining under the current authorization. The company ended the quarter with $1.8b of
holdco liquidity, relatively unchanged from the Q3.

Highlights of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of our estimate changes. The exhibit below highlights the changes we made to our earnings model following Q4 2024 earnings.
. 2025 EPS goes down to $18.05 (from $20.55) to reflect a higher Q1 cat load driven by CA wildfire losses (we assume $1.1b of CA
losses) and lower buybacks, partially offset by higher NII and better underlying margins in personal lines. For CA fires we assume 85% of
the $30b industry loss is in homeowners' and then haircut TRV's statewide share by 15% to reflect both the fact that TRV pulled back in
2024, and they are under-indexed to the HNW space. For the remaining 15% of the insured loss we use statewide share in commercial
property and auto. Our NII is a bit above its guide, as we use the current forward curve to set our estimates.
. 2026 EPS goes up to $23.65 (from $22.35) to reflect better underlying margins in personal lines / business insurance, partially offset
by a higher share count (as a result of lower buybacks in 2025).
. We set our initial 2027 EPS at $26.50, translating to 12% EPS growth and 16.6% return on equity.

Business Insurance Rating Environment-RRC and exposure slow modestly
· RRC: Business Insurance renewal rate change (RRC) was +6.9% in the Q4, a modest slowdown
from +7.2% in Q3. They noted on their conference call that umbrella and auto continue to lead
the way with rate increases well into double digits with both accelerating Q/Q. Property rate did
moderate Q/Q, primarily driven by their national property book, which has seen strong returns.
Property accounted for 15.8% of premiums in the Q4 (vs 18.5% in the Q3 and 16.8% in the prior
year quarter), while workers' comp accounted for 14.9% of premiums (vs 14.4% in the Q3 and
16.2% in the prior year quarter).
· Exposure: Exposure growth was up 2.7%, down from the 3.3% in Q3 and the lowest exposure
change since 2020
· RPC: Renewal premium change (RPC) was 9.6% in Q4, down from the 10.5% in Q3. They
highlighted on their conference that rate increases across middle market remained broad-based,

Pricing Highlights-Personal Lines
Personal Lines-TRV sees rate slow in auto given improved profitability and home modestly slows
· Personal Auto renewal premium change (RPC) decelerated sequentially to 10.2% from 12.8% in
Q3 and their auto underlying combined ratio remained below 100% (96.3% in the quarter) after
returning to profitability in Q1 2024, with the combined ratio at 93.4%, the best margin since Q2
2021. The underlying loss ratio was up 5.2% sequentially given weaker seasonality (Q4 underlying
margins are typically 6-7 points higher vs other three quarters), but down 7.5% Y/Y with some
of the improvement driven by favorable frequency across a number of coverages and sustained
moderation in PD (no amount quantified), as well as a 1.5 pt benefit from favorable re-estimation
of prior quarters in 2024.
. Homeowners' RPC decelerated modestly sequentially to 14.1% in Q4 from 14.4% in Q3 with
the expectation RPC accelerates to the high teens in 2025. The company did note the 4.3 pt y/
y improvement in the underlying combined ratio did include a 2.0 pt benefit from favorable re-
estimation of prior quarters in 2024.
. Auto and home PIFs remain down Q/Q, but new business picks up. Travelers' new business in
auto was up 6% Y/Y at $304 million, after seeing new business down 6% in the Q3. Auto PIFs were
still down 0.3% sequentially (vs down 0.6% in the Q3). Home new business was up 15% in the
quarter (an improvement from the decline of 12% in Q3). From a PIF standpoint, home was down
0.6%, which was modestly better than the 0.9% sequential decline in Q3. TRV noted on their call
that the decline in home PIF continues to reflect their intentional efforts to improve profitability.
As for auto, TRV noted they are actively pursuing growth and will continue to do so.

Valuation
Current valuation. As of 1/22 close, TRV shares are now trading at 2.01x Q4 2024 book value, well
above its 5-year (1.60x) average, and its 10-year (1.51x) average multiple. When excluding unrealized
losses (net), shares still trade at a high multiple of 1.70x Q4 adjusted book of $144.89, which is well
above the 1.41x 5-year average ex AOCI. On a price-to-earnings basis, the shares are trading at 10.4x
our updated 2026 estimate, below the 5-year average of 11.3x, 10-year average of 11.6x, and 10-year
peak of 14.2x. We believe the valuation of the shares is relatively full given we still see limited upside
in numbers. As numbers for 2025 will come down as a result of the CA wildfires, margins have tough
Y/Y comps in 2025 given a strong 2024, which benefited from favorable non-cat weather, and we see
potential for further volatility in casualty picks / reserves in 2025.

Equity Research
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV shares could underperform as (1) they face liability reserve volatility, (2) tough comps in BI and personal lines
underlying margins in 2025 as personal auto pricing moderates and 2024 saw favorable non-cat weather, and (3) a potentially higher cat
load vs what is currently baked in from the Street. In addition, Our rating is Underweight.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $225.00 from $213.00
. Our price target of $225 is based on 9.5x our 2026 EPS estimate. We come to the 9.5x multiple based on a 5% discount to the peer
group of AIG, CB, and HIG (currently trading at 10.0x).
. Implies around a ~1.5x multiple of our projected 2026 book value estimate of ~$151.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the upside include (1) stronger premium growth, (2) reported / underlying margins coming in better than expected, (3) lower-
than-expected losses from CA wildfires and (4) higher-than-expected favorable PYD with minimal movement in long-tail liability reserves.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
