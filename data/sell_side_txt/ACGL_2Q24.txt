Arch Capital
Strong Franchise with Macro Tailwinds
ACGL's 2Q24 results were better than assumed, driven by upside in
underwriting margins and investment income. We maintain a Neutral rating
due to valuation, but consider ACGL a premier reinsurance franchise and the best
name for investors seeking to take advantage of hard reinsurance pricing.
· EPS upside; raising estimates. ACGL reported 2Q24 operating EPS of $2.57,
significantly above our $2.05 estimate and consensus of $2.18. Compared to
our model, the beat was primarily due to better margins and a lower underlying
loss ratio. Other items that contributed included: higher investment income
($0.04 per share after taxes), more favorable prior-year development (+$0.02),
lower cat losses (+$0.01 variance), and lower tax rate (+$0.10 per share). We
are raising our 3Q24 EPS forecast from $1.72 to $1.76 and our 2025 projection
from $8.63 to $8.83, mostly to reflect higher future investment income.
· Business fundamentals were strong. Reinsurance results were marked by
higher than assumed margins (CR 79.5% vs. our 84.7% estimate) and
premiums (+14% versus our -3% estimate). Margins were helped by lower
attritional losses, which more than offset higher cat losses and less favorable
prior-year development. Similarly, insurance margins beat (CR 92.6% vs.
94.3%E), while premiums missed (+7% vs. +8%E). Unlike peers, ACGL noted
insignificant adverse development on casualty business in both the reinsurance
and insurance divisions. MI margins were better than assumed as well (CR
7.2% vs. 20.9%E), helped by reserve releases on recent years. As assumed,
Arch did not repurchase stock in 2Q. Management's tone on business trends
was very upbeat, especially on pricing in the reinsurance market and margins
in MI. A shortfall in insurance and MI premiums was the only major negative.
. We forecast ACGL to report robust results in the near term, but our long-
term outlook is more muted. In our view, ACGL will report strong margins
and top-line growth in re/insurance, and strong margins but lackluster growth
in mortgage insurance. Reinsurance margins should benefit from hard pricing.
MI margins should be lifted by elevated house prices and the strong labor
market. Also, higher interest rates should boost premium persistency and
margins, but are likely to suppress growth in the MI division. Meanwhile, we
assume no share repurchases in the near term given ACGL's stock price and
management's intent to deploy capital into the business amid the favorable
pricing backdrop. On a cautious note, we do not expect margins in both the
reinsurance and MI divisions to sustain at recent levels in the long run and
remain wary of softening terms/conditions in the reinsurance market over time.
J.P Morgan
· We maintain our Neutral rating. We view ACGL as a top-tier franchise, but
in commoditized markets. Hard reinsurance pricing should enable Arch to
report robust results in the near term, but our long-term outlook for the
reinsurance market is cautious. Furthermore, we feel that ACGL's valuation is
not attractive given its long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. Arch is a leading re/insurance
franchise with a track record of higher and less volatile
underwriting margins than most peers. Hard pricing and tighter
terms/conditions should boost underwriting results in the
reinsurance business in the near term. Meanwhile, near-term
results in the MI business should benefit from low attritional
losses and reserve releases. On the other hand, our long-term
outlook for the reinsurance market is cautious. This, along with
current valuation, keep us Neutral on ACGL.

We are Neutral on ACGL due to bullish sentiment and valuation, but consider it
the best stock for investors seeking exposure to the firm reinsurance market. ACGL
is an industry-leading reinsurance franchise with a unique culture and approach to
underwriting that should generate above-average, and less volatile, margins over time.
The company is also a leading mortgage insurer, a business that we believe is
structurally better than P&C reinsurance. In primary P&C, Arch has expanded its
position in wholesale/E&S through the current hard market, and its pending acquisition
of the Allianz book should bolster its middle market franchise. Our near-term outlook is
upbeat as we expect Arch's results to benefit from firm prices and tight terms/conditions
in re/insurance, and ongoing reserve releases in mortgage insurance. However, our long-
term view is more muted, particularly for reinsurance, as we anticipate a softening of the
pricing cycle if underwriting margins stay close to recent levels for the next 1-2 years.
The reinsurance market suffers from structural issues such as low barriers to entry, lack
of differentiation among carriers, and limited pricing power, all of which suggest more
competition if margins stay elevated. Moreover, investor sentiment on ACGL seems
very bullish, and we think that the stock's valuation already reflects optimism for near-
term results. Still, our fundamental outlook for the company is constructive, and we
could get more bullish on the stock if it pulls back.
P&C Reinsurance: Near-Term Outlook Upbeat; L-T Cautious
Reinsurance margins should benefit from hard pricing and tighter terms, but our
long-term outlook remains downbeat. ACGL has historically generated better and less
volatile margins than most reinsurers because of its focus on specialty business (where
pricing is less competitive), conservative underwriting, ability to shift mix with
changing conditions, and judicious management of catastrophe risk. Also, ACGL prices
business using the risk-free rate (leading to more conservative pricing), deploys a long-
term compensation plan for underwriters based on margins over multiple years, and
supplements re/insurance underwriting earnings with fee income from 3rd party capital
vehicles such as Premia. Still, our long-term outlook for reinsurance remains cautious
because of its commoditized nature, the ease of entry of new capital, and a broad set of
capital providers (including some, such as pension funds, with lower return thresholds).
We are skeptical of prolonged hard pricing and believe that 1-2 years of strong margins
will erode pricing discipline. As such, barring an above-average hurricane season, we
expect pricing momentum to slow, especially in higher layers of reinsurance programs,
which are attracting more capital. Any signs of softening of terms/conditions or new
capacity will likely hurt sentiment on reinsurance stocks, which are consensus longs.
MI: Margins to Normalize Lower, Growth Modest
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance via acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and United
Guaranty in 2016) when market conditions were favorable, marked by rising home
prices, stringent lending standards, and disciplined pricing by MI carriers. Arch's MI
business has generated healthy margins since then and, despite the temporary setback
from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have been strong. Over the next few
years, however, we expect MI margins to revert lower to more normal levels as reserve
releases taper off. Still, ACGL's conservative loss picks post-COVID, the strong labor
market, and appreciation of house prices are near-term positives for margins. Higher
interest rates will suppress new sales, but should boost persistency in the business.

2Q24 Details
This evening, ACGL announced second quarter 2024 operating EPS of $2.57, well
above our $2.05 estimate and consensus of $2.18. Compared with our model, earnings
beat in all three divisions, helped by robust margins. Reinsurance results were marked
by higher than assumed margins (CR 79.5% vs. our 84.7% estimate) and premiums
(+14% versus our -3% estimate). Margins benefited from lower attritional losses, which
more than offset higher cat losses and less favorable prior-year development. Similarly,
margins beat in both the insurance (CR 92.6% vs. 94.3%E) and MI divisions (CR 7.2%
vs. 20.9%E). As anticipated, Arch did not repurchase stock in the second quarter. A
shortfall in insurance and MI premiums was the only major negative.

Business trends were better than assumed overall. By business driver, the upside to
our model was driven primarily by better margins and a lower underlying loss ratio. In
addition, results benefited from higher investment income ($0.04 per share after taxes),
more favorable prior-year development (+$0.02), lower cat losses (+$0.01 variance),
and lower tax rate (+$0.10 per share).

Mortgage Ins .: Healthy Margins Drove Earnings Upside
In our view, the mortgage insurance (MI) business will report modest gross
premium growth, high persistency, and robust (albeit normalizing) margins. High
interest rates are a headwind for mortgage insurance volumes and reserve releases
should moderate over time. Still, MI results have been significantly above expectations
in recent periods, and we believe that there is a greater chance of upside to our
prospective forecasts than downside. Also, net premium growth should benefit from
higher retention following the cancelation of the Bellemeade transactions. A decline in
rates would be a positive for new business volumes as well.
In 2Q24, the MI business reported underwriting income of $287 million, well above our
$217 million estimate, driven by better margins (CR 7.4% vs. 20.9%E) and higher
earned premium growth (+4.4% vs. - 8.4%E). The upside in margins resulted from
higher reserve releases (-29.0% vs. - 20.5%E), a lower attritional loss ratio (20.4% vs.
24.0%E), and a lower expense ratio (16.0% vs. 17.4%E). As in 1Q24, the company
attributed the reserve releases to favorable cure rates and the lower attritional losses to
modest claims, partially offset by higher delinquencies. Gross premium growth in the
MI market was sluggish (11th consecutive quarter of decline), but net written and net
earned premium growth benefited from the termination of the Bellemeade agreements in
4Q23. We expect the factors boosting margins in the MI business (higher rates, lower
inventory of houses, etc.) to continue suppressing gross premium growth.
In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were hurt by artificially high delinquencies caused
by homeowners availing themselves of government forbearance programs. However,

after an initial spike in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has been steadily
declining. Following the expiry of forbearance programs, a significant portion of
previously delinquent loans has cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were taking
advantage of the mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial distress. In the
meantime, higher house prices have provided a cushion to homeowners under stress
who are struggling to pay their mortgages, limiting losses for MI carriers. The percent of
loans in default in the U.S. primary MI business was 1.82% at 6/30/2024, up from
1.65% at 3/31/2024 and lower than 1.61% at 6/30/24.

Reserve releases should continue to lift MI margins, but to a lesser extent than in
prior quarters. Higher reported delinquencies at the onset of COVID led Arch and its
MI peers to establish corresponding reserves despite the healthy labor market and
appreciation in house prices. A meaningful portion of these delinquencies was due to
homeowners taking advantage of the government's forbearance protection programs (to
preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship, so actual losses were well below those
suggested by initial delinquencies. In recent quarters, over 80% of MI reserves are from
accident years after COVID, suggesting less of a benefit from the release of reserves
related to COVID delinquencies. Even with this expected decline, however, we expect
MI margins to remain healthy given the strong labor and housing markets, cures on
previously delinquent loans, and the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due to
the appreciation in house prices. Higher interest rates are a positive for margins as well
as they are causing homeowners to stay longer in their existing houses (where they have
more equity), thereby improving persistency in the MI book. On a cautious note, top-
line growth in the MI business is likely to be weak as higher interest rates reduce
mortgage originations. Although a weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead
to higher mortgage defaults, a material uptick in losses seems unlikely in the near term.
Barring a recession, we expect core margins to stay healthy, though declining reserve
releases will drive margins and earnings lower even if economic trends stay favorable.
ACGL has become a leading competitor in the MI market through acquisitions and
could expand further via M&A, although deals seem unlikely in the near term.
ACGL entered the mortgage re/insurance business in 2011 but was only marginally

involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit
unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The company's
2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger
foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P)
and gained distribution in the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch became a top 10
competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market position strengthened
further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which
catapulted it to a top-3 spot (as part of the deal AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance
blocks originated by UGC pre 2017). Arch has also expanded in foreign MI markets
through M&A, including its acquisition of Westpac's mortgage insurance business in
Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Healthy Margins Offset Lower Premiums
ACGL's insurance business reported modestly weaker premium growth, but better
than expected underwriting margins, helped by lower catastrophe losses.
Underwriting income in 2Q24 was $109 million, better than our $86 million estimate.
Margins were stronger than assumed on a reported basis (CR 92.6% vs. 94.3%E), but
worse on a core basis (CR ex. cats and PYD 90.8% vs. 89.6%E). Lower catastrophe
losses (2.0% vs. 5.0%E) more than offset slightly worse attritional losses (55.6% vs.
55.5%E), lower reserve releases (-0.2% vs. - 0.3%E), and higher expenses (35.3% vs.
34.1%E). Gross written premium growth (+7.5% vs. +8.0%E), net written premium
growth (+7.2% vs. +8.2%E), and net earned premium growth (+11.3% vs. +13.6%E)
were slightly softer.

Arch's primary P&C business is benefiting from favorable pricing, but we do not
expect further margin expansion from current levels. After shrinking its "cycle
managed" business (now called as wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to 2017, ACGL
is seeing strong growth in this part of its primary book, driven by price hikes in the
broader market, particularly in E&S. Results in less opportunistic parts of ACGL's book

(specialty small/middle market and franchise) have been healthy as well. High inflation
and rising reinsurance costs are driving an uptick in insurance pricing, especially in
property and cat-exposed lines. Despite firm pricing, we do not anticipate a material
improvement in primary commercial lines margins at Arch and peers because of
headwinds from higher inflation and reinsurance costs. Also, reserve development could
become less of a tailwind because of adverse loss trends emerging in older accident
years. Management teams at insurance underwriters as well as many investors are
optimistic about improving non-cat margins at commercial insurers, but we feel that
assessing results on a non-cat basis is not as relevant given the significant increase
in reinsurance retentions at primary companies. On an overall combined ratio basis,
results for most primary insurers were weak in 2023, precisely because of elevated cat
losses. In contrast, reinsurers' cat losses have not increased to the same extent. In our
opinion, consensus EPS forecasts for commercial lines insurers do not adequately reflect
the shift in cat loads from reinsurers to primary carriers following the uptick in retention
levels with 2023 reinsurance renewals.
Reinsurance: Strong Results Overall
Reinsurance results were marked by upside in margins and premium growth. The
business generated underwriting income of $366 million in 2Q24, well above our $268
million estimate, driven by stronger premium growth and better margins (CR 79.5% vs.
84.7%E, CR ex. cats and PYD 71.9% vs. 80.9%E). Catastrophe losses (9.4% vs. 7.0%E)
and lower reserve releases (-1.8% vs. - 2.0%E) were unfavorable to our model, but were
more than offset by lower attritional losses (48.9% vs. 55.7%E) and expenses (23.0%
vs. 25.2%E). Premium growth was healthy (gross written premiums +15.6% vs.
+1.7%E, net written premiums +13.9% vs. - 3.1%E, net earned premiums +32.5% vs.
30.3%E). Management was upbeat on Arch's positioning in the property cat market
despite pricing moderation from last year. The increase in reinsurance attachment points
in early 2023 shifted the risk of cat losses from reinsurers to primary carriers, and
management indicated that terms remain consistent.

We are skeptical of a prolonged hard market, but trends are holding up better than
expected and ACGL seems better positioned than peers in this environment.
ACGL's reinsurance segment was initially established to take advantage of the hard
market for casualty coverage in the early 2000s. Over the years, however, management
has shifted Arch Re's business mix away from casualty risks towards other specialty
lines such as surety, accident and health, agriculture, and trade credit, which are
generally less competitive and have more attractive risk-reward. The hard pricing
environment has boosted results in recent years and is causing management to increase
its exposure to property coverages. This, in turn, should drive continued strong
premiums and margins. Longer term, however, we remain skeptical of a sustained hard
reinsurance market and expect the pace of price hikes to moderate. Factors that
contributed to a multi-year soft market prior to 2018 (glut of capital, greater fluidity/
speed of capital, more providers of capacity, broker consolidation) are still prevalent,
and should preclude prolonged hard pricing. On a positive note, ACGL's reinsurance
results could benefit from the release of COVID-related reserves, a portion of which
remain in IBNR. Similarly, loss reserves for Ian and other cat events could ultimately
prove to be too conservative.
Raising EPS Estimates
We are raising 3Q24 EPS from $1.72 to $1.76 and 2025 EPS from $8.63 to $8.83.
Our 2024 EPS estimate is increasing as well, from $8.53 to $9.13. Our revised model
reflects higher run-rate investment income. We did not materially alter our assumptions
for premiums or margins, but feel that underwriting income is more likely to exceed
than miss our assumptions. We consider catastrophe losses (which would affect
reinsurance and insurance margins) and housing market conditions (which affect MI
margins and premium growth) the key sources of potential variance in reported results
and our projections.

Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $108.00)
Investment Thesis
We view Arch as a premier re/insurance franchise, but bullish investor sentiment and
valuation keep us from being more positive on the stock. Arch is a leading reinsurance
business that we project to report superior and less volatile underwriting margins over time
given its unique culture and approach to the market. Also, Arch is a top competitor in
mortgage insurance (MI), which we consider a structurally better business than P&C
reinsurance. In the near term, we expect MI results to be marked by improving premium
growth and healthy margins, with reserve releases more than offsetting higher attritional
losses. In reinsurance, firm pricing should boost both premium growth and margins as well.
However, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance business is downbeat. We believe that
structural issues such as low barriers to entry, lack of differentiation by carrier, and limited
pricing power will drive a softening of reinsurance prices if margins stay close to recent
levels over the next 1-2 years. Also, investor sentiment on ACGL is bullish and the stock's
valuation does not seem compelling relative to the company's long-term ROE and EPS
growth potential.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2025 price target from $106 to $108 to reflect our higher
EPS and book value estimates. Our price target assumes a 1.7x multiple on our 12/31/25E
BV ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.7x multiple on our 12/31/25E BV forecast, and an 11.0x multiple
on our 2026 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach with a sum-of-the-parts
analysis that values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from mortgage insurance.
Our target multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix, which has become less
skewed to MI. ACGL trades at 2.0x BV and 11.1x 2025E EPS compared to 1.4x and 7.7x
for the reinsurance sector, 1.2x and 9.0x for MI peers, and 2.0x and 11.7x for the broader
P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for a prolonged period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. In
our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, even as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
· The company announces a sizable share repurchase program. Steady repurchases
by leading reinsurers could help prolong the hard market as well as drive an uptick in
EPS forecasts.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· Additional capacity enters the reinsurance market. This, in turn, could result in a
reversal in pricing trends and potentially drive a reduction in EPS estimates as well as
hurt sentiment on the sector.
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.

the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
