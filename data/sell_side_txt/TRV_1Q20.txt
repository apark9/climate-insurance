TRV: The Umbrella Provides Shelter From BI
Claims; Conference Call Round-Up
路 Summary: Travelers hosted a conference call on 4/21 to discuss Q1
results. The call focused on Covid-19 and the impact on its different
businesses, its updated outlook for net investment income, as well
as thoughts surrounding capital (and the potential for a slowdown in
its buyback in 2020). Our 2020 EPS estimate falls to $9.10 (from
$10.45), 2021 falls to $10.00 (from $11.00), and 2022 falls to
$10.70 (from $11.60) reflective of lower NII, lower buybacks, and
adjustments to our premium and margin assumptions. Our price
target moves to $105 from $110 based on our 2021 BV estimate.
We are surprised the shares traded up post earnings (and
outperformed the P&C sector), but we do view the market
responding favorably to TRV's thoughts surrounding potential
business interruption claims from Covid-19. Below, we highlight key
takes for the rest of the insurance sector coming out of TRV's print
(with some additional laterals also in the back of this note).
路 Business interruption should be mostly insulated from Covid-
19 claims. TRV highlighted that for its commercial property book its
policies require losses to be caused by a direct physical damage to
property for it to be a covered BI loss. Additionally, its standard
policy form specifically excludes losses or damages resulting from a
virus. TRV did say it had some policies that include virus
endorsements and that was included within the charge the company
took this quarter. Additionally, within commercial TRV is seeing
fewer commercial auto and slip and fall type claims and is also
seeing the plaintiffs' bar move to settle claims faster.
. Workers' compensation could be impacted further by Covid-
19. Generally workers' comp claims would be triggered if the
employee can demonstrate that the injury occurred over the course
of employment, including healthcare workers and first responders
(which does not represent a significant part of TRV's book). TRV
highlighted that some states have taken steps to expand the scope
of workers' comp coverage
by
creating presumptions
of
compensability. While giving this caveat on workers' comp, the
company did say the frequency in the comp line has been down.
路 Personal auto is benefiting from a lack of driving. Confirming
what we saw in PGR's numbers, TRV is benefiting from a lack of
driving by its insurers with miles driven down 40% over the final two
weeks of March. TRV did caution that there could be an offset to the
favorable frequency trends as severity could rise as individuals get
into accidents at higher speeds.
路 Capital return could slow, reflective of conservatism in a
weaker economy. TRV pointed to being more cautious when it
comes to capital return as the company was during the Global
Financial Crisis. As a result, TRV to us pointed to a decent slowdown
in share repurchase until there is more clarity on the economy.

Q1 2020 Earnings And Conference Call Highlights
Summary. Travelers hosted a conference call on 4/21 to discuss Q1 results. The call focused on Covid-19
and the impact on its different businesses, its updated view for net investment income, as well as
thoughts surrounding capital (and the potential for a slowdown in its buyback in 2020). Our 2020 EPS
estimate falls to $9.10 (from $10.45), 2021 falls to $10.00 (from $11.00), and 2022 falls to $10.70 (from
$11.60) reflective of lower NII, lower buybacks, and adjustments to our premium and margin
assumptions. Our price target moves to $105 from $110 based on our 2021 BV estimate. TRV highlighted
that it did not believe that the 1.2 point impact from Covid-19 in the Q1 should be multiplied to give an
ongoing quarterly impact (since Covid-19 only impacted about one month of the quarter) as certain items
like bad debt expense (which was 0.5 points) will not necessarily continue. The company did point to
potential commercial claims as well as surety losses depending on the duration of the economy slowdown
and employment practices liability losses due to the increase in furloughs and laid off employees. We are
surprised the shares traded up post earnings, but we do view the market responding favorably to the
company's thoughts surrounding potential business interruption claims from Covid-19.
The Quarter In A Nutshell. This morning (4/21), TRV reported Q1 core EPS of $2.62, missing our $3.15
and consensus of $2.82. The downside versus us reflects a lower level of favorable reserve development,
higher catastrophe losses, and Covid-19 related losses (impacted Business Insurance and Bond &
Specialty Insurance) of $86 million pre-tax, and $68 million after-tax. Weaker underlying results in
Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by stronger Personal Insurance results. The
underlying margin of 91.3%, beat our 92.5%, but that was due to a better margin in personal lines (both
auto and home) as the margins within Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty missed us as they were
both impacted by Covid-19 related charges. TRV pulled its outlook for renewal premium change and
underlying margins due to the potential impact of Covid-19 on its businesses. Net investment income was
$611 million, just beating our $606 million, TRV did update its net investment income outlook to be down
$20 million on a quarterly basis, from the prior $5-10 million decline, which is not surprising given the
drop in rates in Q1. TRV repurchased $471 million, above our $375 million - language in the 10Q pointed
to a potential slow in buyback depending upon how Covid-19 unfolds. Book value per share declined 1.8%
and the core ROE was 11.5%. TRV shares should trade down due to earnings falling short of expectations
and its pulled outlook for the year.

2020 Outlook Removed Except For Net Investment Income
2020 Outlook Lowered For Investment Income, Other Components Pulled. Exhibit 2 below
highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2020. TRV pulled its outlook for renewal premium
change and its underlying margins for the remainder of 2020 as a result of the uncertainty associated with
the potential impacts associated with Covid-19, but did provide an outlook for net investment income, and
also provided helpful color around other line items in the model. The company's fixed net investment
income should be down approximately $20 million per quarter for the remaining three quarters of 2020.
The company also expects alternative investments (other investment income) to be down "significantly" in
Q2 2020. For catastrophe losses, the company highlighted that approximately 40% of its annual losses
have come in the second quarter of the year. TRV did not commit to a level of share repurchases for the
remainder of 2020 but did say that they may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or may not
choose to buy back shares until there is more clarity on the state of the economy. When looking at
premium volume, TRV expects to see more significant impacts in the economic contraction on written
and earned premium. The company further highlighted that earned premium generally lags written
premium and they could feel the impact on an earned basis beyond the end of the year. In Business
Insurance, the company expects a slowdown in premiums, and claims could potentially be elevated from
more workers comp (healthcare workers, etc. ) related claims. In Surety, TRV highlighted that loss activity
could be elevated depending on the length of the shutdown, although they get the sense that a vast
majority of projects are still permitted to proceed. In Personal Insurance, TRV highlighted that lower
frequency favorably impacted underlying results by 1 point in personal auto and favorable frequency
should continue in the Q2 2020 with a partial offset from higher severity. TRV expects premiums (we
model just an earned impact) to be approximately $140 million lower in the Q2 2020 as a result of its
rebate program. Additionally, TRV expects the expense ratio to be elevated in the near term as they do
not expect to make significant adjustments to their fixed expense base in response to short-term
fluctuations in business volumes.

Takeaways For The Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us and the laterals for the rest of the group include:
(1) Commercial lines pricing continues to firm and picked up in the Q1 although the company is
concerned about exposure growth slowing, which could offset the positive impact that rate is having
on premiums. As a result, we have lowered our premium assumptions for Business Insurance for the
remainder of 2020. This is mixed for the commercial insurance (AIG, CB and HIG) as stronger
pricing is being offset by potential a lower premium base.
(2) Business interruption should be insulated from Covid-19 claims. TRV highlighted that for its
commercial property book its policies require losses to be caused by a direct physical damage to
property for it to be a covered BI loss. Additionally, its standard policy form specifically excludes
losses or damages resulting from a virus. TRV did say it had some policies that include virus
endorsements and that was included within the charge the company took this quarter (with 1.5 points
of losses on the Business Insurance loss ratio, or about $58 million). Additionally within commercial
lines, TRV is seeing fewer commercial auto and slip and fall type claims and is also seeing the
plaintiffs' bar move to settle claims faster. This is positive for all commercial lines insurers, but
the most positive for HIG under our coverage, as HIG has a similar account footprint at TRV
and has come under pressure surrounding potential BI claims from Covid-19.
(3) Workers' compensation could be impacted further by Covid-19. Generally workers' comp claims will
be triggered if the employee can demonstrate that the injury occurred over the course of
employment, including healthcare workers and first responders (which does not represent a
significant part of TRV's book). TRV highlighted that some states have taken steps to expand the
scope of workers' comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability. While giving this
caveat on workers' comp, the company did say the frequency in the comp line has been down. The
potential for workers' comp claims would be a negative for HIG, although we believe claims
will most likely be confined to the impacted industries.
(4) Personal auto is benefiting from a lack of driving. Confirming what we saw in PGR's numbers,
Travelers is benefiting from a lack of driving by its insurers with miles driven down 40% over the final
two weeks of March. TRV did caution that there could be an offset to the favorable frequency trends
as severity could rise as individuals get into accidents at higher speeds. This is a positive lateral
for the personal auto insurers (ALL and PGR) who should continue to benefit from
favorable frequency trends in auto (which is their largest business).
(5) Investment income will be pressured for the group. TRV lowered its outlook for investment income
from its fixed maturity investments and also cautioned that the Q2 will be under pressure due to
weaker returns from its private equity investments, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. This
would imply to all insurers (life and non-life) as everyone will be impacted by lower
interest rates and the one-quarter lag with their investment portfolios.
(6) Capital return could slow. TRV pointed to being more cautious when it comes to capital return as the
company was during the Global Financial Crisis. As a result TRV to us pointed to a decent slowdown in
share repurchase until there is more clarity on the economic situation. We had previously thought
that P&C insurers would continue to buyback shares, even with Covid-19 uncertainty, but
given TRV's cautiousness surrounding buybacks we would not be surprised to see other
insurers also suspend buybacks to conserve capital right now.

Highlights Of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of estimate changes. Exhibit 3 highlights the changes we made to our earnings model
following Q1 2020 earnings. Our 2020 EPS estimate goes to $9.10 from $10.45, our 2021 EPS estimate
goes to $10.00 from $11.00, and our 2022 EPS estimate goes to $10.70 from $11.60. We are making
broad adjustments to our model, including:
(1) Lower written and earned premium across each segment to reflect the economic slowdown (and lower
premium in personal auto to reflect the rebate);
(2) NII from its fixed maturity portfolio that is lower by approximately $20 million per quarter in 2020
(and lower alts in the Q2);
(3) Loss ratio adjustments that vary by segment, although BI and surety are broadly moving higher to
reflect potentially higher loss activity and personal lines moving lower to reflect lower frequency
(partially offset by higher severity);
(4) Elevated expense ratios to reflect consistent fixed expenses and declining premium volumes; and,
(5) Removing buyback for the Q2 and including a modest amount in the Q3.

Pricing Improving In Commercial And Homeowners'; Slowed In Auto
Business Insurance Rating Environment -TRV Rates Picked Up As Expected, While Exposure
Declined
. In the Q1, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +6.2%, accelerating 110 basis points
from +5.1% in Q4 2019. Exposure growth was +1.6%, higher than 1.4% in Q4 (although the Q4
number was revised down from 2.7% as TRV revised down its estimate for ultimate exposure change
given the impact of Covid-19).
. See Exhibit 4 below, which shows the recent trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance
(BI) renewal rate change. The charts shows how its rate started to move up in Q4 2017 (following the
high level of hurricane losses during the 2017 hurricane season) then dropped in Q3 2018 and has
since risen over the past five quarters.
. TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC as the company is unsure of how the economy
will be impacted from Covid-19. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC turns negative in
the Q2.

Personal Auto - TRV Continues to Secure Rate, Although The Level Is Slowing
. Within Personal Insurance, TRV continues to secure rate increases in auto (but the level is slowing).
The RPC in auto was 2.4% in Q1 versus 2.9% in Q4, 3.7% in Q3, and 5.0% in Q2 2019. Homeowners'
pricing did accelerate to 7.7% in Q1 versus 7.3% in Q4 and 6.8% in Q3 2019.
. Travelers saw its new business in auto grow for the seventh consecutive quarter (although the level
did slow by a modest amount sequentially), which could be due to the impact of Covid on shopping.
Auto new business premium was $227 million in Q1 versus $224 million in Q4, $236 million in the Q3,
and up from $206 million last year.

Margin Misses In Business And Bond & Specialty Insurance Due To Covid-19
Underlying Results Beat In Personal But Fell Short In Other Segments
路
The consolidated combined ratio was 95.5%, missing our 93.6% estimate largely reflective of higher
catastrophe losses. The $333 million of catastrophe losses came in above our $150 million estimate,
while prior year development slowed (and missed our estimate) due to adverse development for
commercial auto. The underlying combined ratio of 91.3%, improved 30 bps from last year, but fell
short of us and was impacted by Covid-19 (which negatively impacted both the Business Insurance
and Bond & Specialty segments).
路
Catastrophe losses of $333 million were higher than our $150 million estimate and stemmed primarily
from tornadoes in Tennessee.
路
Favorable development totaled $27 million and fell short of our estimate for favorable development of
$70 million. The $5 million of favorable development in Business Insurance missed our estimate for
favorable development of $20 million. Bond and Specialty did not see any development in the quarter
and missed our estimate for $2 million of favorable reserve development. Personal Lines favorable
development of $22 million missed our $48 million estimate.
.
TRV did not provide any forward guidance due to the potential impact of Covid-19 on its businesses.

Investment Income And Other
Investment Income Above Our Estimate, But Forward Outlook Lowered
路
Net investment income was $611 million pre-tax, above our $606 million estimate. Travelers' pre-tax
book yield on its fixed income portfolio was 3.1%, just below the 3.2% yield for Q4 2019. Fixed
income investments added $511 million pre-tax, higher than our $503 million estimate.
路 Income from other investments was $88 million pre-tax, missing our $90 million estimate. Short-term
investments added $22 million, below our $23 million estimate.
. On an after-tax basis, net investment income from fixed income and short-term investments was
down $5 million from last Q1, and in-line with its outlook for investment income to be down $5 million
to $10 million per quarter.
. Given the low interest rate environment TRV lowered its outlook for investment income and is now
looking for income from fixed maturities to be down $20 million after-tax per quarter (as compared to
the prior guidance for a decline of $5-10 million). In the Q2, private equity income will be negative
(with TRV pointing to a 15-30% decline in PE indices in the Q1 and that portfolio is recorded on a one
quarter lag).
Capital Management - Above Our Estimate, But Will Be Muted From Here
. TRV returned $635 million (including $425 million of share repurchase), compared to the $676 million
of core earnings. The level of repurchases was higher than our $375 million estimate, however, the
company did point to slowing repurchases from here reflective of market uncertainty stemming from
Covid-19.
路
As a result of its more conservative posture on forward buybacks we have removed our buyback
assumption for the Q2 and our Q3 estimate of $200 million is well below last Q3 ($375 million) and
the trailing four quarter quarterly run rate ($388 million). Our 2020 capital return estimates have the
company returning approximately 80% of its core earnings while our 2021 and 2022 estimates are
closer to 95%.
Premium Growth Below Us And Slowed Sequentially Due To Slowdown In Business Insurance
路
Net premiums rose 4,1% versus our 4,7% estimate and slowed from 5.7% in Q4. The shortfall in
premiums was due to lower Business Insurance volume, which more than offset stronger premium
within both Bond and Specialty and Personal Insurance. Gross premiums rose by 4.0%, Given the
timing of the Covid-19, TRV did not observe a significant impact of the pandemic on its production
statistics this quarter.
路
Business Insurance net premiums rose 0.6% versus our 4.3% estimate and 4.8% in the Q4. The
slowdown in Business Insurance premiums was due to: (1) lower new business, which was down 6%
due to lower workers' compensation pricing, (2) an 8% drop in international business, due to efforts
by TRV to improve the porfitabli8ty of its book at Lloyd's. Gross premiums grew by a higher 1.4%,
and (3) lower audit premium.
路
Bond and Specialty net premiums were up 12.9% versus our 2.5% estimate and 8.7% in the Q4 due
to strong growth in all of their businesses.
. Personal Insurance net premiums rose by 8.1% versus our 6.0% estimate and 6.3% in the Q4.
Growth was strong domestically, which more than offset a 5% decline internationally as TRV works on
improving the proifitabli8ty of its Canadian book. Within personal insurance, TRV saw growth of 2.9%
in auto (above +2.2% in Q4) and 18.3% in home (versus +13.3% in Q4).

Price Target
Price Target: $105 from $110
Our price target of $105 is based on around a 0.95x multiple of our projected 2021 book value estimate of
around $110 and 10.5x our 2021 EPS estimate of $10.00. Risks to achieving our price target include large
catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs, and
a rise in D&O claims.
Investment Thesis
TRV has seen its loss picks within Business Insurance move higher primarily related to social inflation. We
think the shares could underperform peers moving forward if it does not hit its 2020 margin target and/or
if its reserve releases continue to slow down. In addition, TRV is less exposed to price increases due to its
higher workers' comp exposure and also lacks the exposure to large accounts which have seen the
strongest price increases. We rate the TRV shares Underweight.
Company Description
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV) is the second largest writer of commercial lines in the United States
and also the second-largest writer of personal insurance through independent agents. The company is
organized into three business segments: Business Insurance (54% of 2019 net premiums written);
Personal Insurance (37%); and Bond & Specialty Insurance (9%), which sell a wide range of insurance
and surety products, as well as risk management services. Products are distributed primarily through
independent agents and brokers in all 50 states and in select international markets.
