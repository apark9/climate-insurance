Allstate Corp.
4Q24: Material EPS beat on better
than expected Property-Liability
underlying results and Cat
Operating EPS well above our estimate and the Street on
strong Property-Liability underwriting and benign cat losses.
$1.1 billion initial loss estimate for CA wildfire. Property-
Liability PIF guided to be positive in 2025.
Operating EPS of $7.67 was a material beat vs our $5.36 and Street's $6.23, largely attributable
to underlying loss ratio beats across Homeowners (36.9% vs 43.0% Barc and 41.5% Street) and
Auto (69.1% vs 71.0% Barc and 72.42% Street) as well as lower than expected cat losses
(Property-Liability cat loss ratio of 2.9% vs $6.3% Barc and 4.9% Street). Altogether, these
drivers contributed to Property-Liability reported loss ratio of 63.7% vs our 70.0% and Street's
68.2%. Combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year development was 83.0% for the
quarter, which was favorable compared to our estimate of 85.6% and the Street at 84.6%, and
reflects a 380 y/y improvement vs 4Q23 and 20 bps sequential improvement vs 3Q24. Notably,
the company highlighted that it expects Property-Liability policies in force to grow, which seems
in line with our expectation of 2.2% PIF growth in 2025 across Auto and Homeowners. Overall,
BVPS share of $72.35 grew from $70.35 as of 3Q24. Of note, Auto NPW growth decelerated to
6.4% after posting 8.8%, 12.3%, 12.1% in the three preceding quarters. This came about even as
PIF was improving from (2.0)% in 1Q24 to (1.4)% in 4Q24, as we saw a bigger offset from slowing
premium per policy growth which decelerated from 14.4% in 1Q24 to 7.9% in 4Q24. We expect
the company's orientation to PIF-driven growth, based on management's commentary for
positive PIF growth in Property-Liability and the steady increase in advertising expense ratios,
could continue to weigh down on premium/policy which can offset the degree of NPE growth for
Property-Liability ($57.8bn Barc vs $58.7bn Street).
Property-Liability NPW & NPE: Overall net written premiums grew 8.8% to $13.76 billion,
slightly ahead of our $13.70 billion estimate but below the Street's estimate of $14.02 billion.
Earned premiums grew 10.6% to $13.93 billion which was ahead of our $13.86 billion estimate
and Street's $13.91 billion. Auto earned premiums grew 9.1% y/y, which was driven by rate
increases offset by 1.4% decline in PIF. For the year, rate increases had a 7.5% impact to earned
premium growth in 2024. Homeowners earned premiums increased 15.3%, driven by higher
premium per policy growth of 12.6% and PIF growth of 2.4%.
Property-Liability PIF: Auto PIF of 24.94 million came in slightly higher than our estimate of
24.83 million, which reflects (1.4)% y/y and (0.2)% sequential decline, compared to our (1.8)%
y/y and (0.7)% q/q estimate. Despite the decline, the company highlighted that PIF grew y/y in

31 states that represented roughly 60% of total auto written premiums. In Homeowners,
policies in force of 7.51 million also came in above our estimate of 7.41 million, reflecting PIF
growth of 2.4% y/y and 0.4% q/q, compared to our 1.0% y/y and (0.9)% q/q estimate.
Property-Liability Loss & Combined Ratios: Overall underlying loss ratio (60.2% vs 63.5% Barc
and 62.9% Street) and underlying combined ratio (83.0% vs 85.6% Barc and 84.6% Street)
outperformed against our and street's expectations. The outperformance was more apparent in
Homeowners, which saw delivered strong underlying loss ratio of 36.9% (vs our 43.0% and
Street's 42.53%) and underlying combined ratio of 59.5% (vs our 64.2% and Street's 64.72%). In
Auto, underlying loss ratio of 69.1% (vs our 71.0%) and underlying combined ratio of 93.0% (vs
our 93.8%) were a bit more favorable relative to expectations. Management highlighted that the
severity of claims recorded in the first three quarters moderated in 4Q24. Excluding the severity
benefit, the underlying combined ratio would have been 95.0%.
CA Wildfire Loss est $1.1bn: The company expects $1.1 billion of losses, pre-tax and net of
reinsurance, in line with the upper end of our estimated range.

UNDERWEIGHT
USD 193.01
Price (05-Feb-2025)
Price Target
USD 183.00
Why UNDERWEIGHT?
We see a difficult path for ALL to
meet expectations for growth as
success in Direct and National
General will be offset by lower
retention in the exclusive Allstate
distribution as pricing competition
re-intensifies. Additionally, the
firm's need to deleverage can make
for a longer path to normalized
capital return than the street is
expecting.
Upside case
USD 205.00
Our upside case reflects a similar
methodology as our price target,
but assumes ROE expectations
increase by 50bps to 20.7% to
account for the possibility that
current pricing may remain for
longer, resulting in the stock trading
at a 5% premium to the regression
line.
Downside case
USD 162.00
Our downside case assumes ROE
expectations decrease by 50bps to
19.7% as pricing begins to
decelerate and pave way to
intensifying price competition,
resulting in the stock trading at a
20% discount to the regression line.

Model Update
We have adjusted our 1Q25E catastrophe losses to reflect management's disclosure of $1.1
billion of estimated losses for the CA wildfire event, the majority of which is reflected in
Homeowners with minor increases to Auto as well. We did not increase cat losses by the full $1.1
billion as our baseline estimate had already assumed a level of cat losses from such an event.
The cat loss update, along with updating the model for 4Q24 actuals, resulted in a change in
2025E/2026E/2027E Operating EPS from $16.98/$17.54/$19.95 to $16.12/$18.79/$20.30.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $183 reflects a ~2.4x P/BVPS xAOCI multiple on our 3Q25E BVPS xAOCI estimate which we derive from a
P/BV vs ROE regression and assuming ALL trades at around a 15% discount to the regression line, consistent with it's historical valuation.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside Risks: We see the greatest risk to our
stock call being the possibility that Allstate is more successful pivoting to growth than we anticipate. Additionally, the company could experience
reserve releases from prior year development to the extent auto inflation continues to decline.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by
Barclays or a third party ("Information"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration
is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes ("ESG Regimes"), unless
otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers
or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification,
label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are
reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
