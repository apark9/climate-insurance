TRV: Can't Travel Past Investors' High Bar; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 7/21 to discuss Q2 results. The call focused
on pricing, underlying trends, its expense ratio, and investment income guide. Our 2022,
2023 and 2024 EPS estimates are now $12.40, $15.10 and $17.00 (from $11.09, $14.65
and $16.50). Our 2022 estimate goes up to reflect higher net investment income in both
the fixed and non-fixed portfolio (we are now assuming a -20% return in Q3 in other
investments, versus our prior -32%), favorable PYD, and a better expense ratio. For 2023
and 2024, our estimates go higher to reflect a better expense ratio and favorable net
investment income, particularly within the fixed income portfolio. Our price target is
unchanged at $180. TRV traded down, even following an EPS beat, which we believe was
reflective of the company still seeing loss-trend in BI in the 5.5%-6.0% range and its core
pricing (the RRC of 4.9%) falling below this level.
· Business Insurance color. Travelers said that earned rate over trend continues to
be around one point in Business Insurance (BI). The company did not move off of its
5.5%-6.0% loss trend assumption in the quarter. Within BI, TRV also called out one
point of elevated property losses relative to last year, which implies 2.5 points of
elevation relative to normal levels (as Q2 2021 saw favorable non-cat weather of 1.5
points), this was offset by business mix and other factors which helped the margin
by about 1.5 points and resulted in a flat underlying loss ratio after accounting for
the about one point of earned rate over loss trend. The RRC did accelerate modestly
sequentially (to 4.9% from 4.3%) due to auto, property and primary GL lines and
reflected headwinds the industry is dealing with around inflation and weather.
· Personal auto discussion. Within auto, TRV highlighted elevated vehicle replacement
and repair costs. The renewal premium change within personal auto was 6.3% in
the quarter and TRV expects this to get to double-digits by the Q4. Further, TRV
said that PIF growth is starting to decelerate reflective of the rate they are taking.
Travelers also flagged the unprecedented environment in auto, including body work
CPI, shingles prices and lumber costs. While TRV's result in auto wasn't great (with an
underlying combined ratio of 101.8%), given the 102.1% previewed by ALL last night,
we do not think investors were surprised by the number. On the frequency side, TRV
said it remains in the space of approaching pre-pandemic levels.
· Other investment hold up much better than expected. Alternative-related
investment income totaled $197 million in Q2, up when compared to $142 million in
Q1, and significantly above our estimate for a loss of $145 million. We had thought
the weaker S&P performance (down 5% in Q1) would lead to weaker alternative
results given the one quarter lag on private equity returns. TRV highlighted that their
investments in real estate, energy and transportation did well in the quarter (see
Exhibit 3 inside for a breakdown of alternative portfolio by insurer).
· Our updated thoughts on the group. TRV pointed to underlying margin
improvement continuing as earned rate continued to exceed loss trend. Further,
they saw better alternative investment results (with positive income, versus our
expectation for a loss) which could be a lateral to better results across the board
this quarter. Lastly the personal auto results were poor, with Travelers flagging
elevated severity trends, which was not as much of a surprise to investors given the
disappointing trends revealed by ALL last night.

Beat Versus The Street Overshadowed By Consistent BI Story
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 7/21 to discuss Q2 results. The call focused on pricing,
underlying trends, its expense ratio, and investment income guide. Our 2022 EPS is $12.40 (from
$11.09), while our 2023 goes to $15.10 (from $14.65) and 2024 EPS goes to $17.00 (from $16.50).
Our 2022 estimate goes up to reflect higher net investment income in both the fixed and non-fixed
portfolio, favorable PYD, and a favorable expense ratio, which more than offsets higher cats and a
modestly higher tax rate. For 2023 and 2024, our estimates go higher to reflect a better expense ratio
and favorable net investment income, particularly on the fixed income book.
The quarter in a nutshell. This morning (7/21), TRV reported Q2 core EPS of $2.57, beating our $1.83
estimate, and consensus of $1.97. TRV beat us on better other investments results as we expected
a (10%) negative return in the quarter and favorable PYD offset by higher cats and a higher tax rate
versus us. TRV saw a weaker combined ratio than we expected due to higher cats partially offset by
better PYD, while the underlying loss ratio was fairly in line with us with personal insurance being
the sole miss and Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty beating us. The tax rate was higher than
us, coming in at 16.9% vs. our 15.1%. The underlying combined ratio of 92.8%, beat our 93.2%, with
Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty beating us, while Personal Lines (weak results in both auto
and home) missed us. NPW rose by 10.9%, beating our 4.7% estimate. NII was $707 million, beating
our $363 million due to other investments. Cats were $746 million, higher than our $375 million.
Repurchases were $500 million, ahead of our $450 million. Book value per share declined by 9.4% (due
to the mark to market on the investment portfolio), and the core ROE was 9.3%.
Exhibit 1 below shows TRV's actual results versus our expectations and you can go here to see our first
look note on the quarter: TRV: Q2 Beats on Better NII and Business Insurance Results.

Takeaways for the Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us, and the laterals for the rest of the group are below.
Net-net, the biggest takes are that TRV is still seeing loss trend of around 5.5-6% in Business
Insurance with written rate above this (including the RRC and the portion of exposure that counts
as rate). Futhr Travelers is also seeing high frequency and severity trends within Personal Insurance.
Highlights of the laterals that we see for the group follow below:
· Commercial lines pricing remains strong, with renewal rates up 4.9% in Q2, accelerating once again
from the 4.4% in Q1 in Business Insurance, but still below the 5.1% in Q4 2021, 6.2% in Q3, and
7.0% in Q2. TRV stands out as seeing pricing accelerate in the Q2, as we show MarketScout rating
color below (Exhibit 2) and they showed pretty stable results in the quarter. Rates staying above
loss trend is a positive for the commercial insurers.

· Underlying margin in Business Insurance benefited from rate exceeding trend. TRV said that earned
rate exceeded loss trend by around 1.0 point, which is consistent with the Q1, but is a slowdown
from 1.5 points in Q4 2021 and an even greater slowdown when compared to around 2% over
the other three quarters of 2021. TRV seeing earned rate over loss trend staying close to the
Q1 level implies that all commercial-lines underwriters (including CB and HIG) should see
underlying margin improvement this quarter.
· Strong exposure growth. Exposure growth was a record 5.4%, which was higher than 4.7% in Q1, and
is a bullish sign for the insurance brokers. This adds to the good lateral we already have from the
good organic growth quarter from both MMC and Truist. This appears to be a good sign for all
insurance brokers-given that TRV is more of a small-middle market insurer, it is the best take
for AJG and BRO, but does point to a good quarter for the group in general.
· Personal auto frequency and severity trends pressure results. TRV's Personal Auto book was affected
by elevated severity trends. The Personal Auto segment's underlying margin came in at 101.8%.
The weaker auto results at TRV (as well as ALL in its preannouncement last night and PGR)
point to a tough quarter for the group.
. Net investment income guide was raised for fixed income investments. The company raised its
guidance for fixed income investment income of $470 million in Q3 (up from $460 million) and
$495 million in Q4 (up from $480 million). This is a good lateral for most (if not all) insurers, in
our view.
· Stronger-than-expected alternative investment quarter. Alternative-related investment income
totaled $197 million in Q2, up when compared to $142 million in Q1, and significantly above our
estimate for a loss of $145 million. We had thought the weaker S&P performance (down 5% in Q1)
would lead to weaker alternative results given the one quarter lag on private equity returns. TRV
highlighted that there investments in real estate, energy and transportation did well in the quarter
(see Exhibit 3 below for a breakdown of alternative portfolio by insurer). Given TRV beat us, we
could potentially see other insurers beat our alternative investment assumptions as we built

they didn't' say that results would be negative - they just said results would be lower than H1 2022

2022 Updated Soundbites
Highlights of its updated outlook for 2022. Exhibit 4 below highlights TRV's commentary and
expectations for 2022. TRV did not provide much specific 2022 guidance other than fixed income NII,
expense ratio, and general pricing expectations.
· TRV raised its quarterly fixed income NII (including short term securities) to be $470 million in Q3,
which is up from the previous guide of $460 million, and Q4 2022 to come in at $495 million post-
tax, which is up from the previously guided $480 million. New money rates as of June 30 are about
100 bps higher than what is embedded in the portfolio currently, so NII should continue to improve
as the portfolio gradually turns over.
. In Business Insurance, TRV saw 0.9 points of improvement Y/Y on the underlying combined ratio
with around 1.0 point coming from earned pricing that continues to exceed loss costs, which was
fully offset by higher property severity, and 0.8 points from a lower expense ratio. Within BI, rate
exceeded loss trend by around 1.0 point this quarter, which is flat to the 1.0 point last quarter, but
is down from 1.5 points in the 4Q 2021 and around 2.0 points in the 3Q 2021 and 2Q 2021. We
are modeling for that 1.0 point of earned rate over loss trend to continue to decline from here
as we move through 2022. They also mentioned they have not seen a change in loss costs in the
second quarter as they are still in the range of 5.5% to 6.0%.
. In Bond and Specialty, TRV did not lay out specific guidance for the year.
. In Personal lines, TRV mentioned that frequency is still in the space of approaching pre-pandemic
levels and that they are seeing continued elevated severity driven by inflation. TRV saw overall
premium change of 6.3%, and they expect RPC to approach double-digit rate by the end of the
year.
. With the aggregate reinsurance cover, TRV has accumulated $935 million toward the retention
as of the end of the Q2. With the aggregate cover, TRV gets $225 million of protection as part of
$500 million of coverage above a $2 billion retention.
. TRV lowered expense ratio expectations for 2022 to around 29%, which is favorable to the
previous guide of mid-29s in the near term, They mentioned they do not target any specific
expense ratio but instead manage from a total combined ratio standpoint. We are now looking for
expense ratios of 29.0% in 2022, 28.8% in 2023, and 28.8% in 2024.
. In terms of recession fears, they said they are not seeing any deterioration yet in the underlying
business of their clients that would suggest recessionary risk. They reiterated confidence that even
in a recession the company is set up to do well as they have a high-quality investment portfolio
and strong efficiency. They said potential impacts would be the top-line, but they think they can
potentially offset the impact in the commercial business by getting some relief on loss trend.
In 2008-2009, TRV's investment portfolio had a default rate of less than 1%, which compares
favorably to Moody's 2.0%-2.5% rate and during 2020, their default rate was only 10 bps versus
Moody's 1.0%, which to them shows the strong credit of their book.

Property and casualty insurance market conditions are
expected to remain competitive in 2022 for new business.
TRV did not provide specific guidance for premium volumes
for 2022, as expected. They did note they expect retention
levels to remain strong by historical standards into 2022.
Expects the after-tax investment income from the fixed
income portfolio will be approximately $420 to $430 million for
each quarter of 2022.
Provided With Q4 2021 Earnings
TRV expects their expense ratio to remain in the mid-29%
range in the near term and then gradually move down to
around 29% over the next couple of years.
Given social and other inflation, frequency and persisting low
rate environment, they will continue to see pricing gains to
improve profitability.
They anticipate additional increases in about 25 states
throughout the first quarter, with more actions planned in
subsequent quarters.
Rate actions in additional states are scheduled to take effect in
the coming months and quarters (no mention of numbers).
Homeowners will continue to experience elevated weather
and non-weather loss activity and they will seek rate in
response while also taking into account labor and materials
inflation.
TRV expects higher renewal premium changes going into
2022.
Expects the after-tax investment income from the fixed
income portfolio will be approximately $430 to $440 million (up
$10M versus last quarter guidance) for each quarter of 2022.
Provided With Q1 2022 Earnings
Provided With Q2 2022 Earnings
TRV expects their expense ratio to be around 29.5% for FY22
and then gradually move down to around 29% in the next year so they are expecting 29% for FY22 no, did not issue
or two.
TRV has seen their expense ratio drop quicker than expected
guidance for outer years
The change in their cyber underwriting (minimum
cybersecurity protocols), which is having a meaningful
favorable impact on cyber claim frequency (cyber remains a
small portion of the book), is expected to be completed at the
end of Q2'22.
Their primary response to inflation deteriorating margins is
higher pricing and remain confident in achieving further rate
increases
Expect to see increase pricing as higher severity persists.
They expect Q2 to be the seasonally higher quarter for
weather-related loss levels.
Expect retention levels that renew will remain strong by
historical standards for remainder of 2022, will continue taking
price for persisting headwinds, they are starting to see PIF
growth deccelerate
TRV expects renewal premium changes to reach double-digits
by the end of the year.
TRV expects renewal premium changes to accelerate in each
of the next 3 quarters and approach double digits by the end of
the year.
Expects the after-tax investment income from the fixed
income portfolio to be up $440MM for Q2, $460MM for Q3,
and $480MM for Q4 (up from the $430-$440MM per quarter
guidance previously)

Highlights of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of our estimate changes. Exhibit 5 highlights the changes we made to our earnings model
following 2Q 2022 earnings. Our 2022 EPS is $12.40 (from $11.09), while our 2023 goes to $15.10
(from $14.65) and 2024 EPS goes to $17.00 (from $16.50). Our 2022 estimate goes up to reflect
higher net investment income in both the fixed and non-fixed portfolio, favorable PYD, and a favorable
expense ratio, which more than offsets higher cats and a modestly higher tax rate. For 2023 and
2024, our estimates go higher to reflect a better expense ratio and favorable net investment income,
particularly on the fixed income book.

Pricing Accelerates Sequentially in Commercial Lines, However Is Below
Loss-Trend
Business Insurance Rating Environment-TRV Rates Rise, Still Above Loss Trend
. In Q2, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +4.9%, accelerating from +4.4% last
quarter, but below the +5.1% in 4Q 2021, +6.2% in 3Q 2021, and +7.0% in 2Q 2021. Exposure
growth was up 5.4%, up from +4.7% last quarter, +4.3 in 4Q 2021, +4.0% in 3Q 2021, and +3.1%
in 2Q 2021. Exhibits 6 and 7 below, show the recent trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business
Insurance (BI) renewal rate change. On their conference call, they mentioned that loss trends were
still in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% in the second quarter, but they did caveat they evaluate the loss
cost trend over a long period of time rather than quarter-to-quarter. Travelers also mentioned on
their call that overall pricing remains ahead of loss trend (one point ahead as of 2Q, flat to the prior
quarter).
· TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC (in the summer of 2020), as the company was
unsure of how the economy would be affected by Covid-19. The company has yet to bring back
RPC forward guidance, but has pointed to margin improvement, as Business Insurance earned rate
remains in excess of loss trend. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains positive
in Q3 2022 with some flattening as we navigate through 2022, especially as we come up against
some tougher comps when the economy started to improve post the pandemic lows along with
potential recessionary risks.

Personal Lines-TRV Continues Push for Rate as Severity Remains Elevated, But Will Take Time to
Earn In
· Within Personal Insurance, TRV saw an acceleration in rate in personal auto in the quarter, as it
pushes for price. The RPC in auto was +6.3%, accelerating from +3.3% last quarter, and above the
+1.2% in Q4, +0.5% in Q2, and +0.6% in Q1 as the higher rates TRV has been taking are starting to
earn in. On the auto side, TRV said frequency remains in the space of approaching pre-pandemic
normal levels and said they have yet to see any impact on frequency from gas prices. They also
mentioned they don't see a huge sensitivity in their miles driven relative to gas prices and think
employment levels have a bigger impact on frequency trends. They did emphasize it will take time
for these rate actions to earn into their results. The RPC, even with acceleration, is still modest at
6.3% relative to where severity (which is in the double digits). They did mention they expect rate to
continue accelerating each quarter and reach double-digits by Q4 this year.This ties into our theme
that we need to see more rate going through more of the personal auto premium base, not just for
Travelers, but across the auto insurance industry. See our recent personal lines deep dive.
· Homeowners' pricing continued its acceleration, jumping a record-high 13.5% YOY, which was up
from the 12.3% increase in the Q1, and compares to 8.6% in 4Q 2021, 8.8% in 3Q 2021, and 8.1%
in 2Q 2021. The big increase is driven by a combination of increased rate and higher insured valued.
On the home side, they pointed to a continued headwind of higher loss severity related to a combo
of labor and material price increases.
· Travelers' new business in auto increased 10% sequentially, and was up 6% when compared to
last year, with auto new business premiums totaling $318 million, versus $290 million in the prior
quarter, $279 million in 4Q 2021, $297 million in 3Q 2021, and $299 million in 2Q 2021. Q2
Home new business was up 22% sequentially, but down 6% YOY at $316 million, versus $258
million in the preceding quarter, $273M in 4Q 2021, $312 million in 3Q 2021, and $335 million in
2Q 2021. Further, TRV still showed PIF growth in auto, up 1.2% sequentially (see Exhibit 8 below),
which is counter to PGR who has been pulling back as they haven't been able to get enough price.

Profitability Impacted By Weaker Underlying Results
Underlying Results Come in Modestly Better Versus Us due to Favorable Expense Ratio
· The consolidated combined ratio was 98.3%, worse than our 96.7% estimate, largely reflective of
higher cats partially offset by more favorable PYD particularly in the BI segment. Cats were $746
million, worse than our $375 million estimate, while favorable reserve development of $291 million
was better than our estimate for favorable development $91 million, due to better-than-expected
PYD in Business Insurance (from workers' compensation and favorable movement in CMP) and
Bonds & Specialty (from fidelity and surety). The underlying combined ratio of 92.8% was modestly
favorable to our estimate of 93.2%, and 1.5 points worse than last year. The underlying combined
ratio beat us in Business Insurance (by 1.6 points) and Bond & Specialty (by 0.6 points) while
Personal Lines missed us (by 1.3 points) including falling short of us in both auto and home. On
the Business Insurance side, we were nearly two points above consensus (94.1% versus 92.4%
consensus per Visible Alpha), so the underlying combined ratio of 92.4% was actually in line with
street expectations. Within Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio rose by 5.0 points due
to higher losses in both auto (main driver) and homeowners'. Auto was up 9.8 points versus the
prior year quarter due to higher loss severity as vehicle and replacement and repair costs remain
elevated and to a smaller extent frequency returning to pre-pandemic levels.
. Catastrophe losses totaled $746 million, above our $375 million estimate. The losses were mainly
driven by severe wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States. TRV noted that while
the cats were higher YoY, they were not outsized to their modeled expectations. Through the
end of the second quarter, they have accumulated $935 million of qualifying losses toward the
aggregate retention (under its aggregate reinsurance cover TRV gets $225 million of protection as
part of $500 million of coverage above a $2 billion retention).
. Prior year favorable reserve development came in at $291 million, better than our estimate of $91
million favorable development, due to a higher level of reserve releases in Business Insurance and
Bond & Specialty. Business Insurance saw favorable development of $202 million, better than our
estimate for a release of $37 million, which was driven by better than expected loss experience in
domestic operations in workers' comp for multiple accident years and favorable movement in CMP
(which more than offset an increase in general liability reserves). Bond & Specialty saw a release
of $73 million (better than our estimate for favorable development of $16 million), due to better-
than-expected loss experience in fidelity and surety for recent accident years. Personal Lines saw
favorable development of $16 million (worse than our estimate for reserve releases of $39 million)
as auto saw less of unfavorable development than expected ($6 million versus our adverse reserve
development estimate of $31 million) while home saw less favorable reserve than expected versus
us ($22 million versus our $70 million).

Investment Income, Capital Return And Other
Investment Income Beats Us; Raises 2022 Guidance Yet Again On Higher Interest Rates
. Net investment income was $707 million pre-tax, higher than our $363 million estimate as we
assumed a lower alts return (of -10% as the S&P was down 5% in the Q1 and alts are reported on
a one-quarter lag) and our fixed portfolio was virtually in-line. Travelers' after-tax book yield on its
investment portfolio was 2.7%, above the 2.5% yield in 1Q 2022. Fixed income investments added
$512 million pre-tax, right in line with our estimate, while alts were $197 million, much higher than
our estimate for a $145 million loss. Short-term investments added $9 million, which was also
above our $3 million estimate.
. As a result of the higher trending interest rates, TRV now expects their net investment income
from their fixed portfolio to be $470 million for Q3 (up from the previous guide of $460 million)
and $495 million for Q4 (up from the previous guide of $480 million). They also mentioned in their
10Q approximately 24% of their fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three
years and the weighted average duration of their fixed maturities and short-term securities is 4.8
years (5.1 excluding short-term securities).
Capital Management Ahead Of Expectations On Better Buyback Level
· TRV repurchased 2.9 million shares in Q2 for $500 million (at an average price of $172.57), better
than our estimate for $450 million of share repurchases, flat to the prior quarter. Dividends
were $225 million, bringing total capital return to $725 million, compared to the $625 million of
core earnings. Total capital return to shareholders was 116.0%, which is above the 68.9% of core
earnings in Q1 2022, 78.8% in Q4 2021 and 86.1% for all of 2021, and we are currently forecasting
92.1% and 73.7% in 2022 and 2023, respectively. As of the end of the second quarter, they have
$3.01 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. The last repurchase authorization was
for $5.0 billion in April of last year.
Premium Growth Benefited from Record Exposure Growth And Retention Levels
. Net premiums written rose 10.9%, well above our 4.7% estimate, but decelerated modestly from
the +11.5% in Q1 2022.Results were ahead of us in all three segments (BI, Bonds & Specialty,
and Personal). Gross premiums written growth of 10.9% was ahead of our 6.8% estimate, and
accelerated from 10.4% in the preceding quarter.
· Business insurance net premiums written were up 9.9%, beating our 5.0% estimate, and
accelerating from the 9.1% in the prior quarter.
· Bond & Specialty net premiums written were up 12.6% YOY, also beating our 3.8% growth
estimate, but came down from +22.0% last quarter.
· Personal Insurance net premiums written were up 11.6%, beating our 4.7% growth estimate but
modestly below the +12.3% last quarter. Within Personal Insurance, auto net premiums written
of up 9.5% YOY, which was above our +4.8% estimate and accelerated from the +8.5% last quarter,
while home net premiums written growth of +13.6% was well above our +4.6% estimate, but down
when compared to +16.9% last quarter.

Equity Research
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will benefit from one of the hardest commercial pricing environment since 2003. Although we are positive on the
commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers due to its smaller account exposure and higher workers'
comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation, lower
reserve releases, and Covid-19, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral
and rate its shares Equal Weight as a result.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $180.00 from NC
Our price target of $180 is based on around a ~1.69x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $107 and 11.9x our
2023 EPS estimate of $15.10.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
