July '23: When will PGR invest in
itself?
Modest reserve releases in July marked the end of PGR's prior 6-
month streak of adverse PYD. It is encouraging to see underlying
loss ratio improvement q/q. Hitting a new record low expense
ratio tells us that new business is still rate-inadequate.
Otherwise, PGR would invest in itself.
When will PGR invest in itself? At face value, PGR is pulling out all the stops with 4.1 pts
underlying loss ratio improvements q/q and modest favorable PYD (of $28.5mn), ending its
adverse PYD streak seen in the first six months of the year. With a July combined ratio of 90.6%,
well below its 96% combined ratio target, PGR could have afforded to allow its expense ratio-
wise. Instead we saw a new record low at 15.4%, following 16.0% (a record low at the time) in
June '23 and 16.3% in May '23. This means PGR is not investing in itself just yet. We anticipate
seeing PGR return to its pre-pandemic expense ratio of nearly 20% only when pricing is
adequate and it can organically grow statutory surplus. Cutting its expense ratio once again we
interpret as PGR not wanting to add new business when pricing is inadequate.
PGR is shrinking PIF (down 15k q/q and that shrinking momentum should amplify) which should
improve its premiums-to-surplus ratio. We consider PGR's lower advertising spend and pricing
increases as deliberate attempts to reduce PIF and in turn improve capital adequacy. Especially
coming out of elevated catastrophe losses and adverse PYD during 1H23.

July operating EPS of $0.90 beat our $0.35 estimate, reflecting a lower combined ratio due to
better-than-expected underlying loss ratio and a record low expense ratio.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 135.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~23x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 103.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~18x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
Personal Auto PIF Declined by 15k M/M
Personal auto PIF was down 15k (July '23 vs. June '23), slightly worse than the previous decline
of 8k sequential print (June '23 vs. May '23). On a y/y basis, PGR reported personal auto PIF
growth of +14.0% in July (above our estimate of +13.9% y/y), as auto agency PIF (+10.9% vs. our
+11.2%) and auto direct (+16.4% vs. our 16.1%.)

Underlying combined ratio - Lower expense ratio is
less sustainable over the long term
PGR's underlying combined ratio of 87.9% in July improved from 92.6% in June and 89.5% in
May driven by a better underlying loss ratio of 72.5% (vs. 76.6% in June) and a lower expense
ratio (15.4% in July vs 16.0% in June and 16.3% in May). We do not think one month points to a
definitive trend and we remain cautious about underlying loss ratio improvements from here.
While we were expecting a lower-than-typical expense ratio, PGR's 15.4% expense ratio in July
hit a new record low.
The construction of PGR's underlying combined ratio is different than pre-pandemic. To recap,
PGR's pre-pandemic underlying loss ratio stood at ~68% and expense ratio ran just north of
20%. We think a reversion to this pre-pandemic composition would be positive for the stock.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
Our focus is on an absolute basis, where motor insurance pricing remains elevated relative to
used car pricing using a 2019 base year (see Figure 4). Specifically, used car & truck pricing is up
39.1% vs. motor insurance pricing at 25.3% since Jan. '19. We pay lesser attention to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers, which rose 3.2% over the 12 months from
July 2022 to July 2023. Used car and truck CPI trails all items at -5.6% in July vs. - 5.2% in June
yet used car sales price remains elevated and above motor vehicle pricing indexed to 2019.

Manheim pricing was -2.6% m/m and -11.6% y/y. More importantly, if we compare July '23 to
July '19, Manheim pricing is still up 38.2%. Compounded auto pricing during that period has not
caught up - not anywhere close. There is still significant rate catch-up needed to see that
inflection point. It will be like an "x"; loss costs go down, then pricing goes up - where the two
intersect in our view can take a bit longer, especially given how long it is taking auto pricing to
actually "earn" in.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..

K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or

Valuation Methodology: Our $108 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended 10.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.78x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.

J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related

applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.

Valuation Methodology: Our $109 PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double-digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
