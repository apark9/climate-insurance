January '21 Monthly Results
Stock Rating
UNDERWEIGHT
Unchanged
Personal auto underlying margins expand sequentially (81.5% underlying combined ratio
vs. 84.4% in December) but PYD was unfavorable: Still, personal auto results are below its
April/May margin peak, and we do not expect results will return to the trough. To some
extent, we expect COVID-19 case resurgence helped frequency trends. As the economy
reopens we see personal auto loss trend reverting to the mean and frequency tailwinds
cooling. PGR experienced 4.2 pts of unfavourable PYD which was primarily the result of
lagged December claims being reported in January. Catastrophe losses contributed 0.6
points to the combined ratio.
PIF growth - Personal Auto: Personal auto PIF growth y/y beat our January estimates with
Agent of 9.0% (vs. 8.5% Barclays estimate) and Direct of 13.4% (vs. 13% Barclays estimate).
See Figure 1 for our monthly variance analysis. PGR continued making efforts to file rate
decreases (Figure 4) during the back half of 2020 and into 2021, notably relative to the rest
of the industry. PGR is also instituting COVID-19 relief telematics pricing as discussed (PGR:
Developments Ahead of January Results; Feb 16, 2021).
Protective Insurance acquisition highlights PGR's commercial lines ambitions. What
surprised us on this announcement was that Protective underwrites workers' compensation,
a business line that we did not think was within PGR's risk appetite. Also, Protective's focus is
on insuring riskier vehicles which may pressure results see (PGR: Developments Ahead of
January Results; Feb 16, 2021). PGR grew commercial premiums by 26% y/y (see Figure 5
for Commercial NPW y/y growth).
Estimates and valuation update. We believe PGR's stock performance reflects greater
skepticism on the trajectory of PIF growth and winding down benefits from frequency
trends. As such we are lowering our price target to $85 from $87 and reiterating our
underweight rating on PGR. We are slightly updating our '21 EPS estimates from $5.35 to
$5.44 to reflect January results which beat our expectations, however we added 50 bps of
adverse PYD on a monthly basis, previously we assumed no reserve development. Our
valuation represents a weighted average of 15.5x 2021E EPS and 2.9x 2021E BV ex AOCI of
$29.39. Previously, our price target reflected a weighted average of 16.5x 2021 EPS and 3.0x
2021 BV ex AOCI of $29.54.

Industry View: POSITIVE
Stock Rating: UNDERWEIGHT
Price (16-Feb-2021)
USD 85.13
Price Target
Why Underweight? Our call on PGR takes a longer
term view. PGR may need to hold more capital to
support an evolving business mix, which could lower
ROEs. We see PGR's business expansion beyond core
personal auto focus to be more defensive vs.
offensive. PGR's excess growth in commercial auto
runs against the industry grain and expands risk
appetite to riskier auto classes.
USD 85.00
Upside case
USD 92.00
If PGR is able to leverage its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines, it could achieve
the same measurable success as its core personal
auto book. Our upside case of $92 assumes a 17x P/E
multiple on our '21 EPS estimate.
Downside case
USD 75.00
We think margins peak in 2020 and are not reflective
of longer term trends. Auto pricing reflects artificially
low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic. Our
downside case of $75 assumes a 14x P/E multiple on
our '21 EPS estimate.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage

Valuation Methodology: Our $85 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted 15.5x P/E multiple on our '21 EPS estimate of $5.44 and 2.9x P/BV
excluding AOCI on our '21 BVPS ex. AOCI of $29.39.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR were
to meet its 96% combined ratio objective in newer business lines driving the recent expansion of its core business profile by leveraging its
multivariate pricing model. In addition, we think margins are peaking in 2020 due to environmental factors and not reflective of longer-term
trends but if PGR is able to avoid margin pressure over the long term it could maintain a stronger earnings growth profile than anticipated. While
auto pricing currently reflects artificially low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic, a reversion to more normal pricing points should prove
difficult to achieve. However, normalization of pricing could drive better performance in personal auto.
