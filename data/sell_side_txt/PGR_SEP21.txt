Sept '21: Feeling Fatigue
Stock Rating
UNDERWEIGHT
Unchanged
The key question is - when can PGR price its way back to its long-term target and
start to grow auto PIF again to double digits? Some investors are still clinging to high
hopes of PGR getting out of this dilemma in the next four months through pricing
actions; however, we are more cautious. We think it can take 12-18 months for auto
insurance pricing to be rational, even though most policies are 6 months. The longer it
takes for regulators to get on board with rate filing requests (after that that too long
ago pressing upon rebates), the more time insurers will see accumulation of lost trend
that they are not appropriately pricing. We see severity - as transitory "for longer", with
used car sale prices not rebasing to pre-pandemic levels.
Sept '21 operating EPS beat driven by cats, expenses: Sept operating EPS of $0.08
beat our ($0.07) estimate primarily on pre-tax cats (5.5 pts, ~$195mn), which were ~1
pt better than we expected. The 5.5 pts included 4.7 pts (~$168mn) of cat losses
associated with Hurricane Ida, primarily in auto due to flooding in NJ, NY, and PA. PGR's
underlying combined ratio was 95.3% (Figure 1) up 146 bps m/m on higher underlying
loss ratio (76.2% vs. 75% in August) and expense ratio (19.1% vs. 18.8% in August).
PIF growth facing stiff headwinds on road to underwriting target: PGR's total
personal auto PIF y/y growth (+7.9% vs. our estimate of +9.9%) fell significantly short
of our estimate driven by a slowdown in auto direct (+9.6% vs. our +11.5%) and auto
agency (+5.9% vs. +8.0%). See Figure 2 for monthly detail. Management actions are
needed for PGR to meet its the long-term target CR of 96%. PGR currently has 20
pending requests for rate changes across 8 states. A key focus will be on the speed
regulators allow rate increases, where we see pushback in TX where PGR has 8 pending
requests ranging from 0% to +4.9% (Figure 4). FL is another tough state; PGR has 4
pending requests at around 6% rate increases (Figure 5).
We maintain our price target at $82 and reiterate our Underweight rating. Our $82
PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.7x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2022/2023. '22E and '23E EPS is
$4.24 (vs. $4.23 prior) and $5.49 (unchanged), respectively. '22E and '23E BVPS (ex
AOCI) is $30.36 (vs. $30.43 prior) and $32.98 (vs. $33.05 prior), respectively.

Price Target
USD 82.00
Why Underweight? Our call on PGR takes a longer
term view. PGR may need to hold more capital to
support an evolving business mix, which could lower
ROEs. We see PGR's business expansion beyond core
personal auto focus to be more defensive vs.
offensive. PGR's excess growth in commercial auto
runs against the industry grain and expands risk
appetite to riskier auto classes.

Upside case
USD 102.00
If PGR is able to leverage its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines, it could achieve
the same measurable success as its core personal
auto book. Upside case reflects ~24x '22E EPS and
~19x '23E EPS.

Downside case
USD 75.00
We think margins peak in 2020 and are not reflective
of longer term trends. Auto pricing reflects artificially
low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic.
Downside case reflects ~18x '22E EPS and ~ 14x '23E
EPS.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $82 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.7x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2022/2023. '22E and '23E EPS is $4.24 and $5.49,
respectively. '22E and '23E BVPS (ex AOCI) is $30.36 and $32.98, respectively.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR were
to meet its 96% combined ratio objective in newer business lines driving the recent expansion of its core business profile by leveraging its
multivariate pricing model. In addition, we think margins are peaking in 2020 due to environmental factors and not reflective of longer-term
trends but if PGR is able to avoid margin pressure over the long term it could maintain a stronger earnings growth profile than anticipated. While
auto pricing currently reflects artificially low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic, a reversion to more normal pricing points should prove
difficult to achieve. However, normalization of pricing could drive better performance in personal auto.
