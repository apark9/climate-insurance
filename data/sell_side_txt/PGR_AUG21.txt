August operating EPS loss driven by cat losses: August operating EPS of ($0.19) missed
our $0.10 estimate primarily on 12.3 pts of cat losses (~$432mn), which pushed the
company combined ratio to 105.3%. The 12.3 pts included 9.7 pts (~$342mn) of cat
losses associated with Hurricane Ida. Ex cats and PYD, PGR's underlying combined ratio
was 93.8% (Figure 1). PGR's reported monthly underlying combined ratios had improved
sequentially from 94.1% in July to 93.8% in August, with improvements coming in from
its August expense ratio of 18.8% (beat our 20.4% estimate).
Ida's lingering impact: September will continue feeling Ida's effects in cat losses based
on PGR's disclosures through mid month (~$168mn). We're also including a normalized
monthly cat load resulting in estimated cats of ~$232mn, 6.6 pts (vs. $67mn, 1.9 pts
prior) in September. This is the primary change driving our expected operating EPS for
Sept to ($0.07) from $0.10. For 3Q21, we expect operating EPS of $0.01 vs. $0.47 prior.
Slowing PIF growth as focus continues shifting to bottom line: PGR's total personal
auto PIF y/y growth (+8.9% vs. our estimate of +9.9%) missed our estimate driven by
slower growth in both auto direct (+10.6% vs. our +11.5%) and auto agency (+7.0% vs.
+8.0%). See Figure 2. In 2Q, management discussed steps being taken to achieve the
long-term target of 96%, including 5% average rate increase filings and harder pricing
on the horizon (Figure 3). A key focus will be on the speed regulators allow rate increases,
with some pushback seen in TX.

Industry View: POSITIVE
Stock Rating: UNDERWEIGHT
Price (16-Sep-2021)
USD 92.99
Price Target
USD 82.00
Why Underweight? Our call on PGR takes a longer
term view. PGR may need to hold more capital to
support an evolving business mix, which could lower
ROEs. We see PGR's business expansion beyond core
personal auto focus to be more defensive vs.
offensive. PGR's excess growth in commercial auto
runs against the industry grain and expands risk
appetite to riskier auto classes.
Upside case
USD 102.00
If PGR is able to leverage its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines, it could achieve
the same measurable success as its core personal
auto book. Upside case reflects ~24x '22E EPS and
~19x '23E EPS.
Downside case
USD 75.00
We think margins peak in 2020 and are not reflective
of longer term trends. Auto pricing reflects artificially
low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic.
Downside case reflects ~18x '22E EPS and ~ 14x '23E
EPS.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative
(see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully
read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage

Valuation Methodology: Our $82 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.7x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2022/2023. '22E and '23E EPS is $4.23 and $5.49,
respectively. '22E and '23E BVPS (ex AOCI) is $30.4 and $33.1, respectively.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR were
to meet its 96% combined ratio objective in newer business lines driving the recent expansion of its core business profile by leveraging its
multivariate pricing model. In addition, we think margins are peaking in 2020 due to environmental factors and not reflective of longer-term trends
but if PGR is able to avoid margin pressure over the long term it could maintain a stronger earnings growth profile than anticipated. While auto
pricing currently reflects artificially low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic, a reversion to more normal pricing points should prove difficult
to achieve. However, normalization of pricing could drive better performance in personal auto.

Law) only. Barclays Israeli branch previously held an investment marketing license with the Israel Securities Authority but it cancelled such license
