WRB: Expense Leverage Should Take Numbers Higher; Q2 EPS and Conference Call Round-
Up
Our Call
Summary. WRB reported Q2 2021 EPS of $1.17 just missing our estimate of $1.18
and beat consensus of $1.00. The shortfall versus us was due to: (1) $8 million ($0.03)
of debt extinguishment costs (that we did not have in our model) and (2) a higher level
of catastrophe losses (due to $25 million of Covid-19 losses) which more than offset
stronger earned premium growth and better investment income. Following WRB's
conference call, we are raising our 2021 EPS estimate to $4.45 from $4.28, while our
2022 and 2023 EPS estimates also rise to $5.00 and $5.60, from $4.80 and $5.50,
respectively, reflecting a lower expense ratio, which more than offsets a higher underlying
loss ratio assumption. We are maintaining our price target of $92, which is based on 2.1x
our 2022 book value per share estimate. Shares of WRB should trade up tomorrow as
positive expense commentary should move estimates higher, even when accounting for
higher inflationary expectations.

· Pricing decelerating as WRB goes after exposure growth. WRB saw price increases
of 9.7% in the Q2 excluding workers' comp. This does represent a slowdown from
12.8% in Q1, 15.4% in the Q4 and 14.5% in the Q3, but still puts rate well in excess of
loss trend. WRB continues to get rate that is exceeding loss trend in all lines, except
workers' comp but has prioritized growing its exposure levels as more lines are at rate
adequate levels.
· Leverage on the expense ratio from top-line growth. The focus on growth is helping
the company show a much better expense ratio. The expense ratio in the quarter
came in at 28.7%, better than our 30.0% estimate. While there was around a 50 basis
point benefit from Covid-19, WRB said that the Covid-19 benefit will take time to
dissipate and even when it dissipates, they should be able to make up for the lost
pandemic-related savings by the leverage from the strong earned premium growth.
· Underlying margin improvement driven by the expense ratio. The underlying
combined ratio was 87.5% versus our 87.6% estimate. The underlying loss ratio
of 58.8% (versus our 57.6%) improved by only 40 basis points from last Q2 and
was lower than the 2 points of improvement we were looking for. WRB pointed to
two factors leading to lower loss ratio improvement: (1) elevated non-cat weather
(fire losses) that were 2 points higher than last year, (2) some extra conservatism
surrounding loss trend given financial inflation. WRB alluded to 1-1.5 points of the
elevated non-cat weather as being above a normal baseline level, which implies
that without the non-cat weather they would have seen around 1.4-1.9 points of
underlying loss ratio improvement, which is a healthy number as they are earning in
double-digit rate increases even while absorbing a higher inflationary expectation.
· Premium growth picks up. WRB saw net premiums written growth of 27.2%, coming
in above our 11.8% estimate and improving from 11.1% in Q1. By segment, insurance
net written premium grew by 29.2% beating our 11.6% estimate however reinsurance
growth of 10.8% missed our 13.0% estimate. Within insurance, WRB saw healthy
growth in all lines, with the strongest growth coming from professional lines (+65%),
commercial auto (+31%) and other liability (+29%).

Q2 2021 In A Nutshell
In a nutshell. WRB reported Q2 2021 EPS of $1.17 just missing our estimate of $1.18 and beat
consensus of $1.00. The shortfall versus us was due to: (1) $8 million ($0.03) of debt extinguishment
costs (that we did not have in our model) and (2) a higher level of catastrophe losses (due to $25
million of Covid-19 losses) which more than offset stronger earned premium growth and better
investment income.Net premiums written growth of 27.2% was higher than our 11.8% estimate and
picked up from 11.1% in Q1. The underlying combined ratio of 87.5% fairly in line with our 87.6%
estimate driven by a better expense ratio, with the underlying loss ratio coming in above us (at 58.8%
versus our 57.6% estimate) due to higher non-cat weather losses (about 2 points higher than last year)
and WRB becoming more conservative with its loss picks to factor in higher loss trend for financial
inflation. Catastrophe losses (incl. Covid-19) of $44.0 million added 2.2 points to the combined ratio,
higher than our $18.0 million (1.0 point estimate). Covid-19 losses of just under $25 million were
higher than us (as we had no Covid-19 losses in our estimate) while cats away from Covid of $19
million were just above our $18.0 million estimate. WRB did not repurchase any shares in the quarter
versus our $30 million (0.4 million shares) estimate. The operating ROE was 13.5% and the net income
ROE was 15.0%. Book value per share increased by 2.5% QoQ and 13.7% YOY in the Q2.

Additional Pricing Thoughts
Pricing slowed as more business is at adequate levels. WRB saw price increases of 9.7% excluding
workers' comp (they do not provide the price increase with workers' comp until the 10Q comes out
although we estimate that it was around 9% in the Q2). This compares to the 12.8% excluding workers'
comp (11% including comp) in the Q1 and 15.4% in the Q4 (+13.1% including comp). Exhibit 2 below
shows recent commentary that WRB has provided on pricing over the past two plus years. Further
WRB said that while the pricing level (excluding workers' comp) decelerated by almost 3% sequentially
in the quarter this is because more of the portfolio is achieving rate adequate levels and they are
pushing on the exposure side and are less concerned about pushing for more rate within that portion
of the business.
Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period Pricing Comments
Period Pricing Comments
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with
the exception of workers; compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view
of loss trend, And that is even as we have been factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important
that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate increase and what does this mean
relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year. The simple fact is
that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that are
available in the business, And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about
possibly how we re-prioritize exposure of growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q2 2021
01 2020 Rate increases that continue to progress in response to past conversations around social inflation
and keeping up with loss costs,
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the
prior two being the early 2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very
optimistic about its outlook and looks to take advantage of the hardening market environment where some
lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three years, while most lines are approaching
rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the E&S market, driven by:
(1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased
audit premiums; and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are
at or approaching rate adequacy with the exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are
seeing the same increases and gave the example of professional liability having seen rate increases for
quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more recently and workers' comp is in a soft
market.
June 2021
Non-Deal
Roadshow
(6/21/21)
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting
meaningful rate increases. And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many
product lines where we have been getting rate on rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that
is very encouraging for what that means for margin,
Q4 2020
The market is clearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think
that is very appropriate. And whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and 2002
and 2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is, no cycle looks like any other cycle. When WRB
looks at Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers' compensation, is
achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are
seeing meaningful firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella market,
while property continues to be notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been
primary GL and but over the past couple of quarters that seems to be building some momentum.
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are
becoming more acute. As far as workers' compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is more
likely than not to begin to firm as we make our way into 2021 or sometime next year. The loss ratios
Q3 2020 that WRB selected at the beginning of the year assumed that they would not be outpacing loss
cost trend by the level that they are, The rate increases throughout the year, by and large, are above
and beyond what was anticipated. Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and specifically social
inflation, WRB has deliberately decided to take a wait-and-see attitude.
We saw the firm market accelerate throughout 2019 and it continued to accelerate into 2020,
very evident in Q1. The evidence of this was demonstrated, at least in part by business leaving the
standard market, making its way to the specialty market and in particular, the E&S market. Rate
increases were at a level not seen in some number of years and there was a reduction in
Q2 2020 capacity that various carriers were offering, All of these things were being driven by two major
factors: (1) low interest rate environment and a knock-on effect for what that means for investment
income; and (2) loss cost trends, driven to a great extent by social inflation, which had been benign for an
extended period of time and then crept up on the industry when it was least expecting it and it has
proven to be much more of an issue.
The challenges that the market faces has stemmed from a low interest rate environment, frequency of cat
activity, and social inflation has gotten to the point where it is no longer solely being talked about but it is
actually being acted upon. This is a meaningful sea change that became very visible in the Q4, and
Q4 2019 there is no sign of that slowing down, WRB said that they were excited about what was in front of us. They
were enthusiastic earlier in 2019, and the Q4 2019 built on that enthusiasm. Further WRB said that while
there are some that would suggest that they tend to be an optimistic organization, and that is a fair statement,
the data that they see in their business and the data the industry data supports this optimistic view.
Q3 2019
The fear factor is on the rise. If a low interest rate environment and consistent global cat activity over the
past several years wasn't enough, it would seem as though social inflation is finally coming into focus for
the broader audience. People are beginning to realize that it is real and it is here, Frequency of severity can
no longer be ignored, both in the property space, but even more so in the casualty space.
We are seeing rate increases across the board with the exception of workers' comp, which certainly is
the one major product line moving in the other direction. Granted, all these other product lines and the rates
they're getting, they're not moving up all in perfect lockstep, but directionally WRB was pleased to see things
Q2 2019 moving in a positive direction. Further WRB saw an increasing number of examples of business getting kicked
out of the standard market and making its way into the specialty/E&S market and in addition to that an
increasing demand for facultative reinsurance. These are all historically signs or classic indicators of a firming
market particularly when you have all of these pieces lining up the way they seem to be.
Ex comp, WRB achieved 6.4% rate increase. WRB achieved this with its renewal retention ratio remaining at a
similar level to what it was over the past several years. From WRB's perspective, with the exception of
Q1 2019 workers' compensation, every major commercial business line is in some point of firming, All product
lines do not march in perfect lockstep with one another, but from WRB's perspective directionally, they are
moving together, with comp being the exception.

Additional Thoughts On The Quarter
See below for an overview of additional thoughts on Q2 2021 earnings versus our estimates.
· Premium growth above us. Gross written premium growth of 24.8% beat our 11.2% estimate (and
improved from +11.4% in Q1) and net written premium growth of 27.2% also came in above our
11.8% estimate (and improved from 11.1% in Q1). By segment, insurance net written premium
growth of 29.2% beat or 11.6% estimate, while reinsurance growth of 10.8% fell short of our 13.0%
estimate. Earned premium growth of 17.6% was also above our 12.8%. With its growth, WRB
said that one third of it came from rates that it is taking, and the remainder came from exposure
growth.
·
NII beat on stronger alternatives. Net investment income of $168.2 million was ahead of our
$145.0 million estimate due to stronger alternative investment income than our forecast. Core
portfolio income of $103.0 million was in-line with our estimate, while investment funds of $61.3
million was ahead of our $23.7 million and arbitrage trading accounts of $3.9 million did fall below
our $18.3 million estimate. The investment yield on the core portfolio was 2.15%, growing from
2.02% in the Q1 and 2.09% in the Q4.
· Other revenues above us. Revenues from non-insurance businesses was $109.1 million versus our
$87.5 million estimate (although non-insurance expenses also came in above us), insurance service
fees was $22.3 million just below our $23.0 million estimate, and other income of $0.8 million just
beat our $0.5 million estimate.
. Combined ratio ahead on lower expense ratio. The combined ratio of 89.7% missed our 88.4%
estimate. The insurance combined ratio was 89.9% relative to our 88.3% estimate and the
reinsurance combined ratio of 88.6% came in lower than our 89.5% estimate. The loss ratio was
61.0% versus our 58.4% estimate, while the expense ratio of 28.7% beat our 30.0% estimate and
WRB pointed to the expense ratio coming in below this 28.7% level even when we come out of
Covid-19 (with Covid-19 having benefited its expense ratio by about 50 basis points). Catastrophe
losses including Covid-19 of $44.0 million (2.2 points) were higher than our $15 million (1.0 point)
estimate due to Covid-19 losses in the quarter, while reserve releases of $0.5 million (essentially no
points) were just below our $2 million (0.1 point) estimate. Catastrophe losses included just under
$25 million of Covid-19 related losses, while we had no Covid-19 losses in our estimate.
· Underlying results beat us on better expense ratio, loss ratio higher than us on non-cat weather
losses. The underlying combined ratio was 87.5% versus our 87.6% estimate, due to a stronger
than forecasted expense ratio, while the underlying loss ratio of 58.8% missed our 57.6% estimate,
and improved by 4.0 points from last Q2. The lack of significant improvement in the underlying loss
ratio was due to non-cat weather losses, which added 2 points this year as compared to last Q2
(and were about 1-1.5 points above what WRB would classify as a normal baseline level).
· Capital return above us due to special dividend. WRB did not repurchase any shares in the
quarter, versus our 0.4 million shares for $30 million estimate, and down from $30 million in Q1.
Including dividends (regular and special), total capital return was $112 million, or 51% of operating
earnings of $219.1 million.
Summary Of Estimate Changes
See below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q2 2021 earnings. Following WRB's
conference call, we are raising our 2021 EPS estimate to $4.45 from $4.28, while our 2022 and 2023
EPS estimates also rise to $5.00 and $5.60, from $4.80 and $5.50, respectively. Our higher estimates
reflect a lower expense ratio, which more than offsets a higher underlying loss ratio assumption.

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for WRB: $92.00 from NC
Our price target of $92 is based on a 2.1x multiple of our year-end 2022 book value estimate. Our price target also represents a 18.4x
multiple against our 2022 EPS estimate.
Risk for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe and/or Covid-19 losses.
Investment Thesis
WRB
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases
in 2021 which should translate into underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is currently reflected in consensus
expectations.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities and Structured
Asset Investors, LLC ("SAI"), an investment adviser subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co. If you are paying directly for this research, it is being provided by SAI. For all other
recipients in the U.S. this report is being provided by Wells Fargo Securities.
Wells Fargo Securities' research department may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject
companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject
company's common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on
a subject company's common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the
subject company's common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental
investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary
to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to
maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual
investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in Wells Fargo
Securities research reports.
