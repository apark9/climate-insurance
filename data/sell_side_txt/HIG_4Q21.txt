4Q Earnings Review: Focus on Small
Commercial
HIG's sweet spot is its smaller commercial business. Growth
prospects are strong and underlying margins may not get much
better from here given recent experience.

Beating last quarter's underlying margin expansion is a tough act to follow. Still, we were
disappointed to see sequential underwriting margin compression within Commercial. Going
forward we think HIG will meet its '22 outlook of achieving a underlying combined ratio within
Commercial of 86.5%-88.5%, but further improvements will likely come from the expense ratio
side rather than loss ratio side. A strong economy bodes well for HIG's growth prospects. We
consider its commercial lines premiums to be more tied to GDP type of growth than its peers.
Similar to TRV's comments per their 4Q21 earnings call, we think wage inflation can boost
workers compensation margins. WC premiums are tied to wages but so are indemnity
payments, though the relationship is not 1:1, as WC claims are equally split between medical
and indemnity (according to NCCI).
HIG's sweet spot is its smaller commercial business and it achieved a new milestone by
surpassing $4bn in premiums during 2021. Still, a long way to go to increase share in a $170bn
market. Small Commercial growth prospects are strong but underwriting margins may be as
good as it gets in our view. We saw noticeable compression in small commercial margins q/q
(underlying combined ratios: 88% in 4Q21 from 83.9% in 3Q21).

'22 Guidance update: Key changes include lower personal lines top line (flat to slightly down
from prior flat) and inclusion of COVID-19 losses within group benefits. We think HIG will
outperform its commercial lines premium growth target of 4-5% in 2022, especially considering
higher underlying economic exposures. We think HIG's personal lines underlying combined ratio
guide of 90-92% is ambitious, we are estimating 94.5% in '22E. HIG thinks over the next 5
months it will be largely through with its repricing efforts on auto. We are less constructive, may
take until late 2023 for auto pricing to inflect with loss trends.

HIG benefited from annualized LLP returns of 22% in 4Q vs. 8-10% run rate. HIG has been
shortening the duration of its assets to 4.3 years at YE21 from 5.0 years as of Sept. 30, 2020 by
selling longer duration assets, similar to a move by ALL to counterbalance the negative impact
on valuation from rising interest rates.
We reiterate our Overweight rating on HIG and our PT of $85 based on a 50/50 weighted
average P/E of ~12.5x our blended '22E and '23E EPS of $6.53 (down from our prior $6.76) and
$7.93, respectively, and 1.4x P/BVPS ex AOCI our blended '22E and '23E BVPS ex AOCI of $53.95
(from our prior $53.8) and $58.6 (from our prior $58.2), respectively.

Why OVERWEIGHT?
HIG has sound fundamentals following
transformation which should cont. to
drive a stronger book multiple. ROE
convergence with peers should make
current valuation look inexpensive.
Navigators acquisition is becoming
more accretive given boost from hard
pricing in specialty lines. HIG has
accelerated the pace of its expense
savings plans.
Upside case
USD 90.00
Our upside case reflects stronger than
expected underwriting margin
expansion and commercial P&C
pricing levels and improving group
benefits margins. Our upside case is
~14x '22E EPS.
Downside case
USD 65.00
Our downside case assumes
unsuccessful underwriting margin
expansion and expense savings as well
as a slowdown in the commercial P&C
renewal rate environment. Our
downside case is ~10x '22E EPS.

Commercial lines underlying CR of 88.9% in 4Q21 is ahead of HIG's 2021E outlook range of 90-
92% and on track to meet HIG's 2022E outlook range of 86.5%-88.5% . Conversely, HIG's
personal lines underlying CR of 95.9% in 4Q21 was worse than its 2021E outlook range of 87-
89%. We find HIG's personal lines underlying CR 2022E outlook range of 90-92% to be
ambitious. Group Benefits (0.8)% core earnings margin in 4Q21 lagged 2021E outlook range in
the quarter. Share repurchases were ahead of our estimate in 4Q21 ($500mn actual vs. $300mn
estimate). As such we trimmed our 2022 buyback estimates to align with its 2 year buyback
return objective of $3bn.

We are modeling better commercial lines premiums in 2022 than HIG's plan and worse personal
lines underlying margins (as we anticipate a longer recovery of pricing meeting loss trend,
particularly in auto).

Personal Lines - Down 1% Q/Q, Expected to be Flat to
Slightly Down in '22
While, personal lines written premiums decreased by 1% y/y, we were encouraged to see auto
renewal written price increase of 2.6% in 4Q21 vs. 1.7% in 4Q20 and 2.2% in 3Q21. Still, we
think more rate is needed. The renewal written price increases in homeowners stayed flat at
(+8.1%) in 4Q21 to 3Q21, after falling in the three previous quarters (+8.5% in 2Q21, +9.4% in
1Q21 and +8.7% in 4Q20).
HIG ramped up its rate increase filing requests with regulators during the past 90 days, and
expects to continue to do so through 1H22.
AARP dynamics & HIG's auto turnaround story
We observed the last time the industry had to reprice auto (2015-2017) it took HIG longer to find
its footing. It is a tougher conversation to increase a senior's premiums. More importantly, AARP
policies are 12 months rather than the industry 6 month standard and there was a lifetime
continuation feature in place. In mid 2020, HIG renegotiated its AARP contract for 10 years.
While policies remain 12 months in duration, the lifetime continuation feature went away. Still,
we are not so sure how frequently HIG will renew policies but at least that is a new lever in
place. HIG's prevail product is written on traditional 6 month paper, though it is at this point a
relatively small contribution to overall auto writings.
While HIG is taking action on repricing its inforce on renewal business, the company's ongoing
rollout of its personal lines auto and home product (Prevail) is dampening its PIF decline trend.
Prevail has been rolled out to 8 states to date and is expected to be in more than 40 states by
the end of 2022.

Personal Underwriting Performance
The auto underlying combined ratio of 105.4% was up 15.8 pts y/y reflecting higher vehicle trips
and miles driven (see figure 3). In translation physical damage frequency was worse than HIG's
expectations, but liability frequency was favorable. Elevated auto severity is attributable to
rising wages and supply chain pressures on the cost of used cars and parts.

Part of auto underperformance is seasonality, with its loss ratio running 3 to 5 pts higher on
average in 4Q vs. the year.
The homeowners underlying combined ratio of 75.1% was up 5.2 pts y/y . Favorable frequency
relative to expectations are offsetting increased claim severity from higher building material
and labor costs.
Underlying Commercial Margin - Room for
Improvement?
Commercial lines underlying margin improved ~2.3 pts y/y yet deteriorated 1.7 pts q/q. Notably
underlying combined ratio for small commercial deteriorated to 88% in 4Q21 from 83.9% in
3Q21. Still, HIG is targeting commercial lines underlying combined ratio of 86.5%- 88.5% in 2022
(BARC estimate 86.9%). We see most of the improvements coming from the expense ratio side
reflecting execution of Hartford Next.

Navigators
While HIG is making nice progress, its adverse development within its Navigators business got
our attention. NAVG PYD was $43mn, of which $18mn is recovered from its ADC. LOBs effected
were general liability and assumed reinsurance. While the amount is manageable, we point out
that HIG has exhausted its ADC limit with NICO. That being said, before the ADC deferred gain,
HIG recorded $144mn of total favorable PYD reflecting catastrophe exposed lines, WC and
personal auto.
Commercial Pricing from Here
U.S. Standard Commercial Lines renewal written pricing steady in 2Q21-4Q21, HIG thinks rates
continue to exceed loss trend across most products. Ex workers' compensation pricing was
6.5%.
Workers Compensation was a positive rate contributor (+1.2%) in 4Q (Figure 5) but pricing
headwinds on the horizon toward the end of '22 and into '23 as AY '20 becomes part of the
experience period (3-years in most states). HIG thinks workers' compensation pricing should
remain competitive (flat to slightly negative), especially in Small Commercial.

Middle markets retention dropped slightly to 83% in 4Q21 (vs. 84% in 3Q21, 82% in 2Q21, 80% in
1Q21, and 77% in 4Q20). In contrast, small commercial retention seems to have increased
marginally in 4Q21 at 85% (vs. 84% in 3Q21, 84% in 2Q21, 84% in 1Q21, and 83% in 4Q20).
Group Benefits
Core earnings loss of $(12)mn decreased from $49mn in 4Q20 primarily reflecting an increase in
excess mortality related to Covid-19 and a higher expense ratio. Within short-term disability
claims incidence was highly elevated due to COVID and long-term disability incidence rates
were modestly up. Core earnings margin of (0.8)% reflected excess mortality losses of $161mn
pre-tax which was just below our estimated $165mn pre-tax impact. For 2022, HIG is estimating
between $125-$225mn of pretax losses.
We are seeing a shift in the distribution of COVID deaths amongst age cohorts that impact group
benefits business. COVID deaths under the age of 65 dropped to 34.5% in 4Q from about 41.1%
in 3Q (avg. claim severity is 4x higher for someone under 65 years of age vs. over 65 years of
age).

· COVID-19: In 2022, HIG is estimating between $125mn to $225mn of pre-tax losses within
group benefits, with the majority of the impact in the first half of 2022.
. Core Margins are expected to be in the 6%-7% range, which is consistent with the long-term
margin outlook. While Core ROE is expected to be in the range of 13% to 14% in 2022 and
continuing into 2023.
. As of December 31st, 2021, there is $1.3bn of the share repurchase authorization remaining
for 2022. Additionally, thus far in the calendar year, HIG has repurchased 2.5mn common
shares for a total of $180mn.
. As of the September debt issuance, HIG intends to redeem $600mn of hybrid securities in
April 2022.
. Dividends from subsidiaries are expected to be between $1.7bn to $1.8bn in 2022
· Consistent to what was communicated during the past Investor day, HIG projects
Commercial lines premium growth to be between 4% and 5% with an underlying combined
ratio between 86.5% and 88.5%.
· Commercial lines renewal written premium, excluding workers comp, is expected to run in
the mid-single digits, while Global Specialty lines of wholesale and U.S. Marine will be closer
to double digits.
. Personal Lines underlying combined ratio is expected to be in the range of 90% to 92% in
2022.
· Prevail: Although only in 8 states currently, HIG expects Prevail to be in more than 40 states
by the end of 2022.
· LP long term normalized return in the 8% to 10% range.
Model Updates
Model Updates: We incorporated the following model changes post 4Q21. Since HIG
accelerated the pace of its 2 year buyback target of $3bn during 4Q21, ending the year at $1.7bn
of buybacks and $1.3bn remaining on its authorization. We were previously modeling $1.5bn
buybacks in 2022E, we are now expecting $1.3bn. We are assuming a slower recovery of turning
auto underwriting business around and have increased our underlying loss ratio estimates.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $85 price target for HIG reflects a 50/50 weighting of 12.5x our blended '22/'23 EPS and 1.4x our blended '22/'23 P/B ex
AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.
