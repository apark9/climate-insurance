Progressive Corp.
March '23 Earnings: FL Flurry of
Claims
Florida reform reactions - on the offense - and higher severity
contributed to adverse PYD and a higher loss pick. We
anticipated adverse PYD, yet the toll was worse than expected.
We think PGR generally underplays social inflation; we are
closely watching commercial auto.

Recently passed legislation in Florida (Bill 837) (which encouraged a flurry of claims aimed to
front-run the bill) drove part of PGR's EPS miss. While loss creep is a possibility, PGR's claim
count should be known. Ultimately, FL tort reform, is a good thing, as it disincentivizes lawyers
from pursuing and prolonging cases - which will lower litigation costs to insurers. We
understand most insurers are bracing for any benefit to take some time to materialize. We are
still estimating adverse PYD (2 pts on the loss ratio) in April due to higher inflationary severity. In
general, we are cautious about Progressive's undeterred stance with respect to social inflation.
Peers vocalize more concerns about higher attorney representations more than PGR, especially
on the commercial auto side.
Combined ratio (i.e., bottom line) missed our estimates
PGR missed our combined ratio estimate (106.2% vs our estimated 95.6%) and was above
management's 96% target as all lines reported combined ratios north of 100% (Personal Lines at
104.5% vs our estimated 95.9%, Commercial Lines at 102.4% vs our estimated 93.9%, and
Property at 145.9% vs our estimated 96.9%).

o Tort reform in Florida came into effect March 24, 2023. As the effective date was coming
down to the wire the industry filed ~100,000 lawsuits leading up to March 24, or 77% of
total cases filed since Jan. 1, 2023. PGR views tort reform offensive measures similar to
reserving for a catastrophe. To a lesser degree higher than anticipated severity played a
part in adverse PYD.
o We estimate that adverse PYD hurt the personal lines auto loss ratio by 2.4 pts, as
personal auto represented 55% of total PYD. Commercial auto made up 30% of the
unfavorable PYD due to an increase amount of late claims and changes in reserve
estimates (e.g., inflation, aging of reserves). The balance of adverse PYD came from

property while specialty lines offset some of the negative impact.
· PGR's underlying loss ratio of 77.5%, was worse than our estimated 73.1%. PGR took
$100mn of actuarial adverse adjustments to its current AY, or 2.3 pts. PGR's concerns about
higher severity impacted its case reserves and closes/late reported claims.
· PGR's expense ratio was slightly higher at 21.1% in Mar. vs 20.6% in Feb and 20.2% in Jan.
To recap, PGR's pre-pandemic expense ratio ran just north of 20%.
· PGR reported catastrophe losses of $182mn vs our $55mn estimate. Management noted
that they released $40mn or 0.9 pts of cat losses related to Hurricane lan.
Top line growth (Policies in Force and Net Investment Income) outperformed our
expectations
Personal auto PIF grew +2.1% sequentially (Mar '23 vs. Feb '23), roughly in line with the previous
+2.4% sequential print (Feb '23 vs. Jan '23). On an annualized basis, that would imply PIF
growth of 25% (keeping monthly growth constant over 12 months), though there are
seasonality adjustments needed. On a y/y basis, PGR recognized positive personal auto PIF
growth over the last six months (+10.8% in Mar., +8.1% in Feb., +5.4% in Jan., +2.6% in Dec,
+1.7% in Nov. and 0.5% in Oct.). That said, we question the sustainability of growth, as PGR's
premiums to surplus is ~3x at YE22. PGR's pricing may appear more competitive as the insurer
believes taking rates is behind it, a sentiment that we think is premature. PGR may be leaving
rate on the table. PGR's overall premium growth levels (+19% NPW y/y) consume capital, and it
is generating lower organic capital through earnings than its historical trend.
PGR's pre-tax net investment income (ex expenses) this month was $155mn vs. our $127mn
estimate, helped by improving equity market (+3.3% common stock yield) and fixed income
(+1.4%) returns.
March operating EPS loss of $(0.19) missed our $0.40 estimate, reflecting a higher combined
ratio (106.2% vs our 95.6% estimate) due to adverse PYD (Florida reforms and higher severity
impacting personal auto, late reported claims and reserve assumptions impacting commercial
lines, and changes to cat reserves impacting property lines) and higher catastrophe losses. This
was somewhat offset by a 22% beat on net investment income and 2% beat on premium
growth.
These collective three-month adverse PYD actions are a negative read on ALL (we model
~$140mn or 1.2 pts of adverse PYD on ALL's 1Q23 estimates). Though ALL is more underweight
in FL vs. PGR.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 152.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~22x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 90.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~13x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +10.8% in March (above our estimate of +9.8%),
as auto agency PIF (+5.3% vs. our +5.1%) and auto direct (+15.2% vs. our 13.7%) outperformed
our estimates.

Underlying combined ratio - higher underlying losses
and expense ratios
PGR's underlying combined ratio of 98.6% deteriorated from 91.2% in Feb. and 88.7% in Jan.
driven by a worsening underlying loss ratio (77.5% in Mar. vs 70.6% in Feb. and 68.5% in Jan.)
and slightly higher expense ratio (21.1% in Mar. vs 20.6% in Feb and 20.2% in Jan.) To recap,
PGR's pre-pandemic underlying loss ratio stood at ~68% and expense ratio ran just north of
20%. All that said, management is maintaining it's 96% combined ratio target.

Our focus is on an absolute basis, where used car pricing remains elevated (see Figure 3).
Likewise, if we compare used car & truck pricing to Jan '19 levels, it is up 29.9% vs. all items at

Manheim pricing was +1.5% m/m. We put less weight on on the year-over-year change that was
down 2.4%. More importantly, if we compare Mar '23 to Mar '20, Manheim pricing is still up
53.8%. Compounded auto pricing during that period has not caught up - not anywhere close.
There is still significant rate catch-up needed to see that inflection point. It will be like an "x";
loss costs go down, then pricing goes up - where the two intersect in our view can take a bit
longer, especially given how long it is taking auto pricing to actually "earn" in.

Our PT of $118 (was $121) is based on 16.5x our new '24E EPS and 3.2x '24E BVPS (ex AOCI).
Multiples are unchanged.
Model Updates:
We increase our loss ratio expectations to reflect higher loss picks and the continuation of
adverse PYD, albeit tempered from March levels, reflecting higher severity expectations. Lastly,
we increased our NII estimates.
Updated Operating EPS: We revise '23E from $5.61 to $4.04 and '24E from $7.15 to $7.06.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within
the next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or
an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $122 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended 11.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.7x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.

Valuation Methodology: Our $118PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double-digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
