August '23: Adverse PYD Returns After
a Brief Respite
PGR's 97.2% combined ratio in August (> 96% or better annual
target) largely stems from higher catastrophe losses; ~ 50%
related to Hurricane Idalia and the balance severe weather.

After a July respite, in August PGR reported unfavorable PYD of $73mn (vs. $85mn estimate) or
1.6 pts on the loss ratio (vs. our 1.8 pt estimate). This follows 3.1 pts, 4.6 pts, 4.6 pts, 3.4 pts, 3.5
pts and 6.5 pts of unfavorable PYD in June, May, April, March, Feb., Jan., respectively. This
follows July's modest favorable PYD (of $28.5mn). We are estimating unfavorable PYD pts on the
loss ratio of 1.3% in Sept., 0.9% in Oct., 0.6% in Nov. and 0.3% in Dec.
Expense ratio of 16.5%, while historically low, is no longer a "new" low like we saw in the
preceding months (July expense ratio of 15.4%, following 16.0% (a record low at the time) in
June '23 and 16.3% in May '23). We anticipate seeing PGR return to its pre-pandemic expense
ratio of nearly 20% only when pricing is adequate and it can organically grow statutory surplus.
PGR's underlying loss ratio of 74.6% (vs. our estimated 76.7%) worsened sequentially from
72.5% in July '23. PGR took $113.7mn of actuarial adverse adjustments, or 2.5pts.

USD 149.87-110.04
PGR reported catastrophe losses of $207mn (vs our $79.5mn estimate); ~ 50% related to
Hurricane Idalia and the balance severe weather. PGR's FL market share in combined
homeowners and auto physical damage was 9.7% as of 2022 and we assume industry Hurricane
Idalia losses to be in the low single digit billions. We are assuming PGR exhausted its aggregate
reinsurance cover. Given elevated catastrophe losses during 1H23, PGR was $40-$50mn below
the annual aggregate retention threshold, according to PGR's 2Q 10Q. The same filing
mentioned PGR's expectations to exceed its aggregate retention thresholds in 3Q23. Once
exceeded, it has coverage up to $100mn for non-named storm property losses/$85mn named
events.

Personal auto PIF shrunk 0.6% sequentially (Aug '23 vs. July '23), worse than the previous -0.1%
sequential print (July '23 vs. June '23). On an annualized basis, that would imply PIF
compression of 7.2% although we do not expect monthly trend to be constant over 12 months;
in fact, it should continue to decelerate by month. On a y/y basis, PGR recognized +12.6%
personal auto PIF growth, down from +14.0% in July y/y.
We consider PGR's lower advertising spend and pricing increases as deliberate attempts to
reduce PIF and in turn improve capital adequacy. Especially coming out of elevated catastrophe
losses and adverse PYD during YTD August 2023 ($1.6bn and $1.155bn respectively).

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 145.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~25x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 103.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~ 18x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
Personal Auto PIF Declined by 115k M/M
Personal auto PIF was down 115k (August '23 vs. July '23), worse than the previous decline of
15k sequential print (July '23 vs. June '23). On a y/y basis, PGR reported personal auto PIF
growth of +12.6% in August (below our estimate of +13.2% y/y), with auto agency PIF +10.1%
(vs. our +10.8%) and auto direct +14.6% (vs. our 15.1%).

Underlying combined ratio - Lower expense ratio is
less sustainable over the long term
PGR's underlying combined ratio of 91.1% in August deteriorated from 87.9% in July and was
slightly better than 92.6% in June driven by a worse underlying loss ratio of 74.6% (vs. 72.5% in
July) and a higher expense ratio (16.5% in August vs. 15.4% in July and 16.0% in June).
The construction of PGR's underlying combined ratio is different than pre-pandemic. To recap,
PGR's pre-pandemic underlying loss ratio stood at ~68% and expense ratio ran just north of
20%. We think a reversion to this pre-pandemic composition would be positive for the stock.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
Motor insurance pricing remains subdued relative to used car pricing using a 2019 base year
(see Figure 3). Specifically, used car & truck pricing is up 37.4% vs. motor insurance pricing at
28.0% since Jan. '19. Compounded auto pricing during that period has not caught up - not
anywhere close. There is still significant rate catch-up needed to see that inflection point.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

*This is the closing price referenced in the publication, which may not be
the last available closing price at the time of publication.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $109 PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double-digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
