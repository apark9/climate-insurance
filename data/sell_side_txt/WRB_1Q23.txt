WRB: A Messy Quarter; Q1 EPS and Conference Call Roundup
Our Call
WRB reported Q1 EPS of $1.00, falling short of our $1.24 and consensus of $1.23 due
to cat losses, prior year development on cats, and weaker underlying results (which were
impacted by non-cat property losses).
Estimate and price target changes: We are lowering our 2023 EPS estimate to $4.85
(from $5.15) primarily to reflect the Q1 shortfall combined with lower growth versus
our prior forecast while our 2024 estimate goes to $6.05 from $6.20 and our 2025 EPS
estimate falls to $6.95 (from $7.10). Our forward numbers reflect lower growth counter-
balanced by higher investment income (as current yields remain a good amount above the
book yield). Our price target goes to $77 (from $79).
The good: WRB saw 8.3% of price, excluding workers' comp, which picked up from 6.9%
in Q4 and was the highest level since Q1 2022. WRB spoke positively about the property
market and seeing rates improve throughout the quarter, with more momentum in April.
Investment income of $223.4 million exceeded our $221.0 million, even with investment
funds falling short of us (investment funds returned $2.2 million and WRB expects them
to go back to the normal quarterly level of $20-50 million from here).
The bad: Premium growth fell short of expectations for the second consecutive quarter,
coming in at 7.0%, lower than our 10.3%, and just above 6.7% in Q4. Growth in insurance
was 6.9%, missing our 11.0% and just below 7.2% in Q4. Reinsurance growth was 7.1%,
better than our 5.9% and picking up from 2.9% in Q4 due to stronger property growth.
WRB remains cautious on D&O and commercial auto, but did point to growth picking up
from here with the goal to get back to the double-digits in H2.
The ugly: The overall combined ratio came in at 90.6%, higher than our 87.7% estimate
due to higher catastrophe losses, adverse development on cat losses (from Q4 2022) and
a weaker underlying margin (mostly due to non-cat property losses within the insurance
segment). The expense ratio also picked up 50 basis points due to changes in reinsurance
(lower ceding commissions on some treaties) and increased compensation for new start-
ups.
The stock from here: The shares are indicating down over 4% which we believe reflects
the messy quarter and lower growth. At 10.3x our 2024 EPS estimate we still think there
is value here, especially as top-line premium growth should pick-up in Q2 and then more
meaningfully in the H2.

Q1 2023 Beats On Investment Income, Lower Cats And Expenses
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q1 EPS of $1.00, falling short of our $1.24 and consensus of $1.23.
The variance was due to cat losses, prior year development on cats, and weaker underlying results.
Catastrophe losses came in at $47.9 million, higher than our $32.0 million estimate, and prior year
adverse reserve development was $24.0 million unfavorable vs. our estimate for adverse development
of ($3.0) million. The adverse development was due to property cat losses that happened late in the
Q4. Investment income came in at $223.4 million, versus our $221.0 million estimate, with the core
portfolio and arbitrage trading account coming in above us and investment funds falling short of us.
There were FX losses of $9.5 million that offset earnings by $0.03 per share.
The underlying combined ratio of 87.7% was above our 86.3% estimate; the underlying loss ratio came
in 110bps higher than us due to higher non-cat property losses. The expense ratio was 40 basis points
higher than our estimate. WRB bought back $135.2 million shares in the quarter, relative to our $60
million estimate. The operating ROE was 16.1%, and the net income ROE was 17.4%. Book value per
share grew 3.7% QoQ.

What the Companies Are Saying - WRB
Outlook. Flow of business out of standard market to the E&S market remains quite robust, with
product liability being the one outlier with national carriers regaining a bit of an appetite. Overall WRB
expects growth to pick-up in the second half of the year, but did caveat that with saying they are
operating with a level of discipline and are cautious on some areas on the market, principally D&O and
some areas of commercial auto.
Pricing. WRB saw rate of 8.3% (ex workers' comp), which was versus the 6.9% last quarter, and
WRB said the rate remains ahead of loss trends with this being the strongest rate increases since
this time last year. In the property market, WRB said that they believe we are in the early stages of
meaningful firming. With that being said, they stated the market was a little disappointing in January,
but momentum picked up during the quarter, and they saw meaningful rate traction in April. The D&O
market, particularly the large account space, remains in a free for all in terms of both rate adequacy
and pricing. Within reinsurance, they said there is some excitement around the firming reinsurance
market, particularly around property and property cat. Casualty is disciplined and certain parts of the
professional lines market are causing WRB to pause as they are not seeing ceding commission come
down, even though the level of underlying price is eroding.
Guidance. WRB only provided guidance around the expense ratio, which they said should be below
30.0% in 2023 (they expect the expense ratio to be in the range of 28-30%). The Q1 expense ratio was
28.8%, rising 50 basis points from last year due to: (1) change in reinsurance (including lower ceding
commissions on certain treaties), and (2) increased compensation for new start-ups.
While the company does not provide top-line growth guidance they did allude to premium growth
picking up in H2 and perhaps in the Q2 as they look to lean into and write more property business.
In response to our question they alluded to premium growth potentially getting back to the double-
digits in the second half of the year.
Investments. WRB saw investment income of $223.4 million in the quarter as the core fixed portfolio
saw a yield of 3.63% in the quarter, just below our 3.64% estimate. Investment income should continue
to be a tailwind for WRB as new money rates are well above the 3.8% book yield (perhaps somewhere
between 4.25-4.5%). Investment funds returned $2.2 million (below our $12.2 million estimate) and
WRB expects them to go back to the normal quarterly level of $20-50 million from here. In the quarter
the investment funds performance was impacted by declines in market value in the financial services
and consumer goods sectors, partially offset by income from transportation and energy funds.
Liquidity and Capital. WRB's debt to capital ratio ended Q1 at 29.0%, which is below the YE 2022 level
of 29.6%. Repurchases in the quarter totaled $135.2 million, which was higher than our $60 million
estimate and a pick-up from $87.6 million in Q4.

Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period
Pricing Comments
Q1 2023
Regarding property, the company noted that its disappointment in Q4 pricing discipline has improved month over month,
resulting in what is regards as real progressing being made on the pricing front in April. The company feels the rationalization of
pricing in the property market, while more pronounced on the cat side, is broad-based overall. The company called out public
D&O, certain professional liability lines, and commercial auto as being the most irrational parts of the market. Still, WRB does
see pockets of opportunities even within professional liability, especially if written on an E&S basis.
WRB said they were disappointed in the discipline in property pricing in the Q4 as they said many carriers failed to take into
account limited reinsurance capacity and higher reinsurance costs. They believe that property pricing should continue to improve
as 2023 develops. For workers' comp, they said they missed the timing on when the market would begin to harden and they
expect pricing to be bumpy in 2023 with expectation for considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given severity trends,
particularly medical inflation. For auto, they said there is rate to be had but remains the most susceptible line to social inflation
and requires thought and judgement in underwriting for loss costs. Umbrella and general liability excess are amongst the brighter
opportunities with one area on the cautious watchlist being large account excess lines. Professional liability is a tale of two stores
with D&O being pressured given the rising competitive landscape but other lines within professional liability should provide good
opportunities. WRB said they participated at 1/1 renewals and said the clock is right to lean in with good discipline with the US
offering more attractive returns than international.
Q4 2022
Q3 2022
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers'
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Q2 2022
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to see
resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth target,
which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust. In
workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity and
erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from that.
Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable momentum,
up 45% YOY.
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing
is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something
measured in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious
and most of the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive
on WC pricing in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this
stage, particularly in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any current opportunities.
Q4 2021
Source: Company reports and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Period
Pricing Comments
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a growing
headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we
don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty
writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and even more so
in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's definitely
encouraging
Q3 2021
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers;
compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been
factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate
increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year. The
simple fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that are available in
the business. And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about possibly how we re-prioritize exposure
of growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q2 2021
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the prior two being the
early 2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to
take advantage of the hardening market environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three
years, while most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the E&S
market, driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased audit
premiums; and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are at or approaching rate
adequacy with the exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the
example of professional liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more
recently and workers' comp is in a soft market.
June 2021
Non-Deal
Roadshow
(6/21/21)
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting meaningful rate increases.
And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many product lines where we have been getting rate on
rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.
Q4 2020
The market is clearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think that is very appropriate. And
whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and 2002 and 2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is,
no cycle looks like any other cycle. When WRB looks at Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers'
compensation, is achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are seeing
meaningful firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella market, while property continues to be
notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL and but over the past couple of quarters that
seems to be building some momentum.
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are becoming more acute. As far as workers'
compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is more likely than not to begin to firm as we make our way into 2021 or
sometime next year. The loss ratios that WRB selected at the beginning of the year assumed that they would not be outpacing
loss cost trend by the level that they are. The rate increases throughout the year, by and large, are above and beyond what was
anticipated. Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and specifically social inflation, WRB has deliberately decided to take a
wait-and-see attitude.

Summary of Estimate Changes
Estimates lowered. See below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q1 2023 earnings.
Following WRB's conference call, our 2023 EPS estimate goes to $4.85 from $5.15, our 2024 estimate
goes to $6.05 from $6.20, and our 2025 estimate goes to $6.95 from $7.10. We lowered our 2023
estimate mostly to account for the Q1 2023 miss. Our forward numbers reflect lower growth counter-
balanced by higher investment income, and currently we model a core fixed income portfolio yield for
2023 and 2024 of 3.85% and 4.24%, respectively, vs. the fixed income yield in the quarter of 3.63%.

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB trades at 2.40x Q1 2023 book value, which is above the 5-year and 10-
year average multiples of 2.09x and 1.75x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 1.42x and 10-year
minimum is 1.11x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 2.99x, which is well above where the shares are
currently trading. We do note that for the P&C sector price-to-book valuations are fuller given the
unrealized losses we have seen in this rising interest rate environment. For WRB, if we exclude AOCI,
the shares are trading at just around 2.00x adjusted Q4 book. On a P/E basis, WRB is trading at 11.7x
our 2024 EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year average multiples of
18.2x and 16.9x, respectively. It is above the 5-year minimum, which is 10.6x (during the low point of
the pandemic) and above the 10-year minimum of 10.4x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 25.0x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases in
2023, particularly as they lean in on property insurance and reinsurance, which should translate into a good level of premium growth and
underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $77.00 from $79.00
Our price target of $77 is based on just around a 2.1x multiple of our year-end 2024 book value estimate. Our price target also represents
a ~12.7x multiple against our 2024 EPS estimate. The 12.7x is close to the lows where WRB has historically traded as we believe the
multiple may stay constrained until WRB returns to reporting stronger premium growth. With that being said the multiple still provides
double-digit upside potential in the name.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe losses.

This document is being provided for the exclusive use of AVERY PARK at HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL.
W.R. Berkley Corporation
Equity Research
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
