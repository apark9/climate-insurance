1Q24 Earnings: EPS Miss; Premiums Traveling Slightly
Slower Than Expected, Higher AY Loss Pick a Surprise
KNSL reported lower than expected earnings and slightly softer premium
growth, breaking its long-running beat-and-raise streak. KNSL's 1Q24 print
was surprising, not because of the premium growth it put up (slightly lower than
our estimate but not nearly as weak as the 1Q24 stamping data would suggest), but
because of the higher loss pick that it set for the quarter. Although rebasing
prospective margins off 1Q24 would suggest downside to our EPS estimates, we
are not making any changes ahead of the earnings call tomorrow. We consider
KNSL a high-quality E&S operator but remain Neutral - despite the potential for
the hard P&C market to persist - because of the stock's full valuation.
路 EPS missed. 1Q24 operating EPS was $3.50, above consensus of $3.35 but
lower than our $3.63 assumption. A lower tax rate related to stock-based
compensation (14.6% vs. 19.0%E) added about $0.24 to reported EPS, and
thus we estimate core operating EPS to be $3.26. Underwriting income missed
(-$0.32 per share after tax), with lower claims (+$0.09) and expenses (+$0.10)
more than offset by unfavorable variance in net earned premiums (-$0.53). Net
investment was lower as well (-$0.02 per share after tax).
路 Gross premium growth modestly below expectations, premium retention
lower too. Gross written premiums rose +25.5% to $448.6 million, a touch
below our +27.0% estimate ($454.1 million) and lower than consensus of
+30.4% ($466.3 million). Premium retention was 78.3%, also below our
79.0% assumption and consensus of 79.4%. As a result, net written premium
growth of +17.4% ($351.1 million) lagged our +20.0% assumption ($358.8
million). A similar gap occurred for net earned premium growth (+30.5% to
$309.5 million vs. JPM +36.9% to $324.8 million).
路 Underwriting margins were worse than assumed, although KNSL's
results still compare favorably to most other insurers. KNSL's combined
ratio in 1Q24 was 79.5%, worse than our 77.6% estimate, with the negative
variance attributable to higher attritional losses (61.3% vs. 59.3%E) and
expenses (20.7% vs. 20.6%E), slightly offset by better favorable development
(-2.7% vs. - 2.5%E). Catastrophe losses were in-line (0.2% vs. 0.2%E). The
core combined ratio (82.0% vs. 79.9%E) was worse than expected as well.
路 Leaving EPS estimates unchanged ahead of the earnings call. Overall, the
1Q24 print suggests downside to our EPS estimates and price target. However,
we are not making any changes pending more information on the following: (1)
1Q24 AY loss ratio: Kinsale's practice is to set loss picks higher in 1H and to
reduce them in 2H. Although this seasonality is in our model, we would be
interested in hearing whether the actual vs. expected gap in the 1Q24 AY loss
ratio can be attributed to a difference in quarterly patterns, discrete short-tail
losses in the quarter, or more substantially, a change in KNSL's view of the full
year AY loss ratio. We had been assuming AY loss ratios in 2024 and
subsequent years that are flat with 57.4% in 2023, which we think is reasonably
conservative given the positive pricing spread Kinsale continues to generate

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded
P&C insurer that operates exclusively in the E&S insurance
market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our long-
term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable
market, superior technology platform, and low cost base, which
we view as a sustainable competitive advantage. Still, the stock's
valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle
moderates.

and the increasing share of property business (which has lower loss ratios) in its book.
However, we also recognize that KNSL can opt to be more prudent in setting reserves
given the current environment. (2) Submissions and average policy sizes: In our view,
submission count growth is a reasonable proxy for KNSL's policies in force (PIF) growth,
which can be combined with KNSL's disclosure on average policy sizes to estimate
prospective gross premium growth. From 1Q23 and 1Q24, we estimate that PIF grew at
a high-teens to low-20s pace. However, growth in average policy size has slowed,
declining from a peak of 40% in 2Q23 to 3% in 1Q24, implying that in 1Q24, most of the
GPW growth was driven by PIF. (3) Premium retention: KNSL has updated its
reinsurance program because of its changing business mix and is retaining less premium
than previously. Lower retentions will weigh on premiums that appear in KNSL's P&L.
(4) Reserve development: We would look to get insight into the expected tail on
construction defect liabilities from years 2017-2019, as well as management's comfort
in drawing down reserves from not as seasoned but much better priced accident years
(2021-2023).

Investment Thesis
Please see Page 7 for tables and
charts summarizing 1Q24 results.
KNSL will hold its earnings conference
call at 9:00 AM Eastern on April 26, 2024.
The dial-in number for the call is 800-715-
9871; code: 7469751. The call replay will
be available on https://
ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We are Neutral. We expect KNSL's premiums and margins to benefit from favorable
trends in the E&S market, which continues to generate healthy growth at attractive
pricing/terms. Despite more stable conditions in 2024 (i.e. less of a positive delta than in
2023), the property market remains compelling and KNSL intends to grow the relative
size of this business (~30% of premiums in 2023) while controlling its exposure to
property catastrophe risk. In the meantime, casualty pricing could experience another
uptick as more insurers recognize adverse development. Across the pricing cycle, we
think that Kinsale's low-cost operating model is a sustainable competitive advantage,
especially against higher cost competitors like Lloyd's writers. We remain Neutral on
the stock, however, as we think its valuation is full compared to commercial peers and
specialist names even after giving credit to KNSL's growth potential and above-average
margins. Further, while favorable P&C market conditions are likely to persist through
2024 and should have positive implications for KNSLs reserves and future earnings, the
eventual turn in the P&C pricing cycle is a downside risk to the stock's above-average
multiple. Having said this, if KNSL's near-term growth trajectory comes in better than
our expectations, we could become more constructive on the stock.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
In our view, the E&S market - where KNSL operates exclusively - will eventually see
moderating new business volumes and price hikes as more underwriters focus on growth
(a negative for pricing) and admitted markets increase their appetite for risk (recapturing
business from E&S). We also expect retail brokers to eventually divert business back to
admitted markets to recapture the economics they are sharing with wholesalers. Still,
our view is that KNSL can continue to grow premiums at a healthy pace given its small
base and the fragmented pricing cycle whereby certain lines are seeing pricing
deceleration (property excluding high value homeowners') and others could potentially
see another upward inflection (casualty). With respect to profitability, our view is that
the combination of price hikes and conservative reserving will support healthy margins
at KNSL for the foreseeable future. However, we think that reserve releases will
diminish in the near term given that more mature accident years (2015-2019) are likely
to have less redundancy than before, and that more recent accident years (2020 and
onwards) - where presumably embedded margins are thicker - are still un-seasoned.
Low Cost Base a Sustainable Competitive Advantage
KNSL has a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform built from ground up -
in contrast to peers that use unwieldy systems built off legacy and newer technologies -
which allows it to handle significant business volumes without sacrificing customer
responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense efficiency. As a result, KNSL
maintains an industry leading expense ratio, and we expect it to outperform higher cost
competitors (especially Lloyd's) through the pricing cycle. During softer markets,
KNSL can grow premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-average
profitability. In hard markets, Kinsale can be a price taker and generate excess returns.
KNSL is in the process of updating its technology platform towards a "target state" with
more modular architecture and where insured data can be accessed across multiple
applications simultaneously. Management expects these upgrades to deliver cost
efficiencies, incremental revenues, and analytical capabilities. The amount of funding

for this initiative was not sized by Kinsale, but management noted that it should be fully
absorbed in the current run-rate expense ratio.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect price hikes to
eventually moderate as re/insurers re-position themselves for growth. Given this, we see
multiple compression as a risk since pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in
E&S because of its function as a safety valve for the market. Although we think some
portion of E&S share gains is permanent and that KNSL will thrive even if prices
soften, a reasonable valuation analysis will have to look several years out because of
KNSL's above-average growth profile and would thus have to account for conditions in
the market at that time.

Maintaining EPS Estimates
We are maintaining our 2Q24 and 2025 EPS estimates at $4.09 and $20.40. Our 2024
EPS estimate is declining from $16.31 to $16.15 to reflect the downside in 1Q24.
Overall, 1Q24 trends suggest downside to our EPS estimates, but we are leaving these
unchanged ahead of the earnings call tomorrow.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale (Neutral; Price Target: $420.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our
long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior
technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are maintaining our December 2024 price target of $420. Our price target assumes
a 5x multiple on 2025 BV and a 20x multiple on 2025 operating income. These target
multiples are well above peers', which we think is supported by KNSL's above-average
premium growth (mid-teens growth versus mid- to high-single-digit growth for most large
commercial peers) and margin profile (high 70s to low 80s CR versus 85-90% for peers).
KNSL trades at 9.0x BV, well above specialty peers (ex. PLMR) of 2.3x and commercial
peers at 1.6x. On 2024E earnings, KNSL trades at 28x versus 14x for specialty insurers (ex.
PLMR) and 11x for commercial insurers.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
路 The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher prices and
greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If current conditions
persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our forecasts and investor
sentiment would likely improve.
路 Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We would
expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds growth
expectations in the next few years.
路 Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving suggests margin
improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin improvement tracks higher than
expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
路 Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are pushing
back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are deploying capital and
positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to turn, there is a risk of multiple
compression for insurers that have seen an outsized benefit from higher prices.
路 Adverse loss trends or social inflation reemerge in casualty reserves. Although
unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and low limits, the
reopening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up liability claims.
路 Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has a
strong underwriting track record, and it is entering new lines in a strong part of the cycle.

Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage, the impact of badly underwritten
risks is likely to persist. Also, inflation is a risk for both casualty and property coverages.

J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
