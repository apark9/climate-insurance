4Q21 Review: Getting Granular
Disappointing auto results dominated ALL's 4Q print. Included
in this note is our review of statutory auto rate filings to
supplement ALL's disclosures.

Potential Upside/Downside
-2.2%
We applaud ALL's increased disclosures and proposed touchpoints with investors and hope to
take full advantage. Nevertheless, these efforts do feel a bit foreboding. We anticipate a long
road ahead for auto pricing to catch up with loss trend; will look more "U" like for quite some
time (could be late 2023). Included is our analysis of statutory auto rate filings to supplement
ALL's disclosures. Quick takeaway, headline rate increases (ALL mentioned 2.9% in 4Q) are not
meaningful yet. The actual dollar amount at play is small compared to ALL's large premium
base.
Multivariate loss trends - much more layered than higher miles driven and CPI inflation.
ALL is seeing rising bodily injury/casualty trends, exacerbated by higher medical inflation and
attorney representation rates. The complexity of layered loss trends at play makes it more
difficult to envision an expedient path back to longer-term profitability levels. There is no snap
back.
Investment portfolio actions to shorten asset duration taken in 2021 and more to come in
2022: ALL sold long durated fixed income assets to counterbalance the negative impact on
valuation, given higher interest rates resulting in a lower fixed income portfolio yield and
investment income in the near term. As such, ALL shortened its asset duration to 4.2 years in
2021 from 5.0 years in 2020. It makes sense, given it sold its life business. We assume the
duration of its liabilities is now less than 3 years. ALL's AOCI has dropped to $655mn at YE21
from $3.3bn at YE20, accelerated by the recording of the ALIC sale in 1Q21.

Trimming our EPS estimates to $8.13 for '22 (from $8.99) and $11.96 for '23 (from $12.66)
predominantly to reflect underlying auto loss deterioration persisting through 2023, near 75%.

We maintain our EW rating and $119 PT. Our PT is based on a 50/50 weighted average of ~ 12x
our blended 2022 and 2023 EPS estimates and 1.4x our blended YE22 and YE23 book value per
share ex AOCI estimates. We look forward to seeing progress on ALL's transformative growth
plan. We would be more constructive on the stock when ALL shows signs of PIF growth while
returning to mid 90% auto combined ratio. We think that scenario is more likely when adverse
loss cost trends meaningfully abate.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
ALL's fundamentals are strong and we
look forward to seeing progress on its
transformative growth plan. However,
pricing correction actions may stall
ALL's progress in actualizing stronger
PIF growth.
Upside case
USD 135.00
Loss cost trends abate, returning to
2019 baseline levels. Successful
execution of Allstate's
transformational growth plans via
efficiency gains that is translated to
strong PIF growth, particularly in auto.
Our upside case of $135 assumes ~17x
our '22 EPS estimate.
Downside case
USD 100.00
Steeper acceleration of loss cost
trends, particularly on the severity
side. Prolonged period of achieving
approvals from regulators with respect
to requested rate increases. Our
downside case of $100 assumes ~12x
our '22 EPS estimates

benefiting from a frequency tailwind. Blending these figures, optically it appears that once we
see normalization of miles driven that may eventually cost ALL $1.5bn. However that
assumption does not take into account pricing actions. Still, directionally it means that loss
trends will get worse before they get better. In other words, we are not at the trough.

policyholders driving back to pre-pandemic levels, which may be a prelude for what may come.
We analyzed Allstate Brand's reported auto gross frequency data (auto physical damage) since
2010 to create a baseline. It appears that frequency has not returned yet to pre-pandemic levels,
which means the loss trend may get worse from here. We understand its Allstate brand book has
more preferred customers who are still working from home, office policies may change in the
future. In contrast its NatGen book's more non-standard auto focus is already seeing its
favorability compared to pre-pandemic levels."
"While claim frequency increased relative to
prior year, reflecting a return to more normal
driving environment, we continue to see

Comparisons: ALL, PGR & the Industry
Historically, ALL showed a consistent track record of outperforming the industry, as measured
by the statutory direct incurred loss ratio. We saw ALL momentarily underperform the industry
during 2Q21, on this basis. While ALL no longer underperformed the industry during 3Q21, that
does not mean its performance got better; the industry just caught up. On this basis, ALL also
noticeably unperformed PGR in 2Q21 and to a lesser degree in 3Q21. (4Q statutory data not yet
available).

From a GAAP perspective, the gap between PGR and ALL started to narrow in 2Q21. By 4Q21 ALL
no longer outperformed PGR. Keep in mind PGR operates at a lower expense ratio than ALL.
Note, we looked at total auto loss ratios, there may be nuances with PYD and cats.

Our Review of Auto Rate Filings: Progress 2021-2022
ALL mentioned it had achieved rate approvals on $800mn on Allstate brand premiums during
2H21. We have done our own work reviewing auto rate approval filings for ALL (not limited to
Allstate brand). Since rate requests are based on future renewal effective dates, we are able to
look ahead into the outer months of 2022. Rate approvals for 2022 so far show a weighted
average +4.5% approvals on $5.3bn of subject premiums in 2022, or $239mn in additional
premiums, which in our view does to move the needle much. To put that in context, ALL
reported ~$28bn of auto premiums in 2021.

While we expect rates will take time to get through, ALL was slow to take rate decreases during
the pandemic relative to peers, so we would expect less catch up. ALL began taking rate
increases during 3Q21 and accelerated those efforts in 4Q21.

4Q21 Highlights
Auto Frequency and Severity up: Within Allstate brand, property damage gross claim
frequency spiked y/y to 21.5% in 4Q21 vs. 16.6% in 3Q21. Likewise, property damage gross claim
severity climbed y/y to 18.2% in 4Q21 vs. 15.1% in 3Q21.
Auto underlying loss ratio up to 75.5% in 4Q21 vs. 72.9% in 3Q21. We had estimated 74.9%
auto underlying loss ratio for 4Q21.
Underwriting details: ALL delivered a 4Q Property-Liability underlying combined ratio of
91.3% (vs. our estimate of 90.4%), a deterioration from 90.4% in 3Q21. ALL's underlying loss
ratio of 67% (vs. our estimate of 66.4%) increased relative to 3Q21 of 66.1%. ALL's 4Q underlying
expense ratio of 24.3% was steady q/q.
Reserve strengthening: Mostly seen in auto insurance casualty coverages and shared economy
business within commercial lines. ALL's reported 104.3% auto combined ratio was impacted by
2.1 pts of adverse non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates and an additional 1.6 pts for
reserve strengthening for the first three quarters of 2021.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or
an affiliate.
N: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $119 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of ~12x our blended 2022 and 2023 EPS
estimates of $8.13 and $11.96 and 1.4x our blended YE22 and YE23 book value per share ex AOCI estimates of $80.3 and $86.9.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.
