TRV: Setting the Stage for Q2 P&C Earnings; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 7/20 to discuss Q2 results. The call focused on
pricing, underlying trends within the auto market, its recent investment within Fidelis, and
underlying business trends.Our 2021 EPS estimate rises to $11.57 (from $11.07), our
2022 estimate is now $12.15 (from $11.90) while 2023 goes to $13.00 (from $12.95)
reflecting adjustments to our investment income, premium and margin assumptions. Our
price target rises to $159 (from $155) and is based on 1.25x our 2022E book value. TRV
got a modest lift from earnings coming in above expectations as the majority of the beat
was driven off of favorable alternative investment income.
. TRV is the first P&C insurer to report leaving many tea leaves for the rest of
earnings season-including: (1) commercial lines pricing slowed (as shown within
their renewal rate within BI), which was expected, but TRV did say they expect written
rate to exceed loss trend for some time, (2) exposure growth was 2.4%, which was
the strongest level in nine quarters and is a strong sign for the insurance brokers, (3)
within their personal auto book they are starting to see loss trends return toward
pre-pandemic levels (this became more evident as we moved towards the end of the
quarter) and will look to take some rate in certain states as we move through the
year, (4) it was a strong investment income quarter driven by alternative investments,
and (5) M&A commentary was unchanged. TRV added to its leverage in the quarter,
which was in-line with the company's expectations, as it had expected to bring up its
leverage to help support its top-line growth.
· Pricing and margin color. TRV expects written rate to stay above loss trend for some
time, which points to continued underlying margin improvement. In the current
quarter, Business Insurance saw a 2 point benefit from earned rate exceeding loss
trend, which should be well-received, and they did not seem concerned about loss
trend rising (from their assumed 5%). The level of BI margin improvement in the
quarter was positively viewed, although the 1.5 point of better non-cat weather than
expected lowers the starting margin base for next Q2.
. Personal auto losses rising, although not fully evident in Q2 results. TRV's personal
auto margins in the Q2 were not yet back to 2019 levels, however TRV said that
frequency was closer to pre-pandemic levels towards the end of the quarter. Further,
as loss experience approached pre-pandemic levels, TRV said that they will look to file
for rate increases in selected states later this year. TRV's margins are not yet back to
2019 levels (whereas PGR's Q2 results were worse than what they saw in 2019) which
we believe is most likely due to the larger concentration of non-standard risk within
PGR's book and the nonstandard drivers perhaps have less work from home flexibility
and have returned to the officer sooner.
. Buyback and M&A thoughts. Buybacks picked up modestly in the quarter, while TRV
pointed to using the $750 million from the recent debt offering to support growth. Its
recent investment in Fidelis does not impact TRV's capital management strategy.
· Its investment in Fidelis. TRV recently made a minority investment in Fidelis and
indicated it was small, given the level of the investment was not disclosed. The Fidelis
investment will give the company access to the non-admitted market, and while it
does bring some reinsurance exposure, it does not change TRV's overall view, which is
that they are not looking to get bigger in reinsurance via M&A.

Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 7/20 to discuss Q2 results. The call focused on pricing,
underlying trends within the auto market, its recent investment within Fidelis, and underlying business
trends. Our 2021 EPS estimate rises to $11.57 (from $11.07), our 2022 estimate is now $12.15 (from
$11.90) while 2023 goes to $13.00 (from $12.95) reflecting adjustments to our investment income,
premium and margin assumptions. Our price target rises to $159 (from $155) and is based on 1.25x
our 2022E book value and 13.1x our 2022E EPS.
The Quarter In A Nutshell. This morning (7/20), TRV reported Q2 core EPS of $3.45, beating both
our $2.68 estimate and the $2.39 consensus estimate. TRV's results beat on better underlying results,
higher favorable reserve development and stronger investment income, which more than offset higher
catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 91.4%, came in better than our 92.1% estimate,
with Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty beating us, while Personal Lines missed us (on weaker
results within auto and home). NPW rose by 10.7% (or +7.6% excluding the auto rebates last year),
beating our 3.7% estimate. Net investment income was $818 million, better than our $604 million
estimate with the upside virtually all due to other investments. Catastrophe losses were $475 million,
higher than our $300 million estimate. Repurchases were $401 million, ahead of our $375 million
estimate. Book value per share rose by 3.9% and the core ROE was 13.7%.

2021 Outlook
2021 outlook mostly unchanged, although investment income guidance moves modestly higher.
Exhibit 2 below highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2021. TRV did not provide specific
2021 guidance, which is consistent with previous quarters in 2020 after TRV pulled its outlook in Q1
2020 for renewal premium change and its underlying margins as a result of the uncertainty associated
with the potential impacts associated with Covid-19. TRV did provide an outlook for net investment
income, and also provided helpful color around other line items in the model. TRV now expects 2021
fixed income NII to be in the $425-435 million range per quarter on an after-tax basis during the
remaining two quarters of 2021 (up from its prior guidance of $420-430 million). TRV did not call out
any alternative investment income trends. For catastrophe losses, TRV highlighted that as of Q2 it
has incurred $1.5 billion towards the $1.9 billion retention under its aggregate program. In Business
Insurance, TRV did not call out any Covid-19 losses in the quarter (as our expectation is losses have
largely subsided for the group) but did say the Y/Y compare with the BI margin benefited from the net
Covid-19 charge the segment saw last year. Within BI, rate exceeded loss trend by around 2 points in
the quarter, compared to a little less than 2 points in Q1 and over 1.5 points in Q4 2020. Bond and
Specialty did not have a specific guidance for the year (with Q4 2020 earnings TRV said they expected
the underlying margin to be better than the 87% in H2 2020 during 2021). Personal lines results
benefited from favorable frequency but TRV pointed to starting to see miles driven return to pre-
pandemic levels as the quarter came to a close. In homeowners' results were impacted by elevated
frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses. No color was given on the expense ratio.

Pricing momentum slows a bit in commercial lines. Business Insurance renewal rate change was
7.1%, dropping from 8.3% in Q1, 8.3% in Q4, 8.1% in Q3, but stable with 7.1% last Q2. Exposure growth
was 2.4%, versus the 1.4% last quarter. TRV pointed to the sequential slowdown in rates reflective
of rational moderating rate increases in excess casualty and national property due to three years of
compounding rate increases in the two business lines.

Takeaways For The Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us and the laterals for the rest of the group are below.
Net-net, the biggest take is the fact that they expect to see written rate excess loss trend for the
foreseeable future, combined with the fact that they saw driving levels approach pre-pandemic levels
by the end of the Q2.
Commercial lines pricing remains strong, but is decelerating with renewal rates up 7.1% in business
insurance, falling from 8-8.3% over the prior three quarters, but stable with last Q2. TRV attributed the
sequential slowdown to lower prices within excess casualty and national property. Rates staying above
loss trend is a positive for the commercial insurers (AIG, CB, HIG, and WRB) and specifically AIG and
CB where workers' comp represent a smaller portion of their book, in our view.
1. Underlying margin in Business Insurance benefited from rate exceeding trend and favorable non-cat
weather. TRV said that earned rate exceeded loss trend by around 2 points, which is better than the
'a little less' than 2.0 points in Q1, and 1.5 points in Q4 2020. TRV also said that it expects written
rate to stay above loss trend for some time. To us, this points to strong underlying margins for the
group in the Q2, with the potential for continued improvement throughout the year and into 2022.
This would be a positive as well for the commercial lines insurers, including AIG, CB, HIG and
WRB.
2. Strong exposure growth. Exposure growth was 2.4% which is the strongest level in nine quarters and
highlights the robust improvement in the economy and is a bullish sign for the insurance brokers.
This adds to the strong lateral we already have from the exceptional organic growth quarter from
Truist. This appears to be a good sign for all insurance brokers-given that TRV is more of a
small-middle market insurer, it is the best take for AJG and BRO, but does point to a strong
quarter for the group in general.
3. No Covid-19 losses were called out. This was the case last quarter as well and ties to our overall
thought that Covid-19 related losses have largely subsided for the P&C sector. The only P&C
company that had pointed to Covid-19 losses was HIG, although that was with its initial 2021
outlook at the start of the year. We do not expect to see many, if any, Covid-19 losses from P&C
insurers in the Q2.
4. Personal auto loss trends are getting back to pre-pandemic levels. TRV's Personal Auto book saw
continued benefits to its margin from lower claims frequency, but the company said they were
largely back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the quarter. The Personal Auto segment's
underlying margin came in at 92.0%, which was the worst quarter since the start of 2020, but is
still above the 95.7% in Q2 2019. Our sense is that PGR skews more non-standard auto than ALL,
HIG and TRV which is probably why its margins have deteriorated more in the Q2 than TRV's did.
In general, we remain cautious on the personal auto insurers (EW-rated ALL [$127.49] and UW-
rated PGR [$94.57]) due to the lack of pricing in the market, combined with the potential for
frequency to return to more normalized levels as driving picks up.
5. Net investment income guide revised up to reflect growth in invested assets. TRV raised its quarterly
net investment income guide for its fixed income NII to be between $425-435 million after -- tax
(up from the prior $420-430 million). TRV invested assets are benefiting from the $750 million of
debt they issued in the Q2, but nonetheless the lack of revising down its investment income signals
that the low interest rate environment should be mostly in numbers at this point. This is a good
lateral for most (if not all) insurers, in our view.
6. Strong alternative investment quarter. Alternative related investment income totaled $335 million
in Q2, up from $218 million in Q1, $182 million in Q4 2020 and $173 million in Q3 2020. We
think alternative related investment income could surprise to the upside, for both P&C and life
insurers, based on TRV's strong results.
7. Repurchases picked up in the Q2. TRV repurchased $401 million in Q2, up from $397 million in Q1,
$201 million in Q4 2020 after not repurchasing any in both Q3 or Q2 2020. Further, TRV said
that its recent investment in Fidelis (the level of which was not disclosed as it was minor) does not
impact its capital management strategy. We expect all insurers, P&C and life, to pick up their level
of buyback activity in the Q2, especially given the still attractive valuations across both the P&C
and life insurance sectors.

Business Insurance Rating Environment -TRV Rates Taper Down, But Still Well Above Loss Trend
. In the Q2, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +7.1%, below +8.3% (revised lower) in
Q1, +8.0% in Q4 2020, +8.1% (revised lower) in Q3 2020, but same as +7.1% (revised lower) in Q2
last year. Exposure growth was +2.4% versus +1.4% in the Q1 2021 (revised up from 0.8%), -0.3%
in the Q4 2020 (revised up from -0.5%), -0.2% in Q3 2020 (revised up from -0.4%), and -1.3%
in Q2 2020. TRV said model changes on the length of the time period it looks at its RPC drivers
results in the revisions to previous quarters. See Exhibits 4 and 5 below, which shows the recent
trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal rate change.
· TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC (last summer) as the company was unsure
of how the economy would be impacted from Covid-19. The company has yet to bring back
RPC forward guidance but has pointed to margin improvement as Business Insurance earned
rate remains in excess of loss trend. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains
positive, in the Q3 although maybe not as strong as the Q2 given the dramatic drop in exposure in
last year's Q2.

Personal Auto - TRV Pointed To Looking To Take Price In Auto And Home
. Within Personal Insurance, TRV saw a deceleration in rate in personal auto in the quarter. The RPC
in auto was 0.2% in the Q2 versus 0.5% in Q1, 0.9% in the Q4,1.6% in the Q3, and 1.6% in Q2. On
the auto side, TRV said that they have started to see driving frequency match pre-pandemic levels
towards the end of Q2 and they are monitoring trends and incorporating them into their state-
specific pricing decisions. Homeowners' pricing accelerated to 8.2%, compared to 7.6% in Q1, 8.2%
in the Q4, 8.1% in the Q3, and 7.5% in Q2 of 2020. On the home side, TRV said they will look to
take price in response to the high level of fire and non-cat weather losses they are seeing.
· Travelers saw its new business in auto grow in the Q2, with auto new business premiums totaling
$299 million versus $278 million in the Q1, $269 million in the Q4, $276 million in Q3, and $251
million in Q2. New business was also up in home in the quarter, growing to $335 million from $261
million last Q2.

Profitability Benefited From Better Underlying Results And Higher PYD
Underlying Results Came In Better-Than-Expected
· The consolidated combined ratio was 95.3%, beating our 95.9% estimate largely reflective of
a higher level of favorable reserve releases and better underlying results. Cats of $475 million
were higher than our $300 million estimate, while favorable reserve development of $182 million
was significantly above our $23 million estimate due to higher releases across all segments. The
underlying combined ratio of 91.4% was favorable to our estimate of 92.1%, and in line with last
year. Underlying results beat us in Bond & Specialty and Business Insurance (which benefited from
rate exceeding loss trend as well as non-cat weather than was 1.5 points favorable versus TRV's
expectations), while Personal Lines was just below us due to weaker results in both auto and home.
. Catastrophe losses totaled $475 million and came in above our $300 million estimate-due to the
cat announcement by ALL in June and the losses that PGR also saw in June we were not necessarily
surprised to see TRV see cats that exceeded our estimate. TRV noted that the $475 million in cat
losses was mainly related to severe wind and hail storms in several regions of the U.S. Through
the end of the Q2 TRV has $1.5 billion of cat losses counting towards its $1.9 billion aggregate
retention (due to TRV's cat definition, some losses count towards the aggregate retention that the
company does not consider cat).
. Reserve releases were $182 million, significantly better than our $23 million estimate due to
higher releases in Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty, and Personal Lines. Business Insurance
which saw favorable development of $73 million (significantly better than our $2.5 million
estimate and following the highest quarterly level for the segment in three years in Q1) as releases
in workers' comp were only partially offset by strengthening for run-off operations, Bond &
Specialty saw $44 million (higher than our estimate for adverse development of $0.2 million) due
to better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product lines, and Personal Lines
saw $65 million (higher than our $21 million) due to better than expected losses in the both auto
and homeowners.

Investment Income And Other
Investment Income Beats Us; 2021 Guidance Revised Up Modestly
. Net investment income was $818 million pre-tax, better than our $604 million estimate. Travelers'
after-tax book yield on its investment portfolio was 3.3%, above the 2.9% yield for Q1 2021. Fixed
income investments added $493 million pre-tax, lower than our $490 million estimate, while alts
were $335 million, higher than our $120 million estimate and benefited from higher private equity
returns. Short-term investments added $1 million, below our $3 million estimate.
. TRV now expects 2021 fixed income net investment income to be in the $425-435 million range
per quarter on an after-tax basis during the remaining two quarters of 2021 (up from its prior
guidance of $420-430 million) as growth in invested assets is offsetting the impact of lower
interest rates.
Capital Management
. TRV repurchased $401 million for 2.6 shares in the Q2, better than our estimate for $375 million
of share repurchases. Dividends were $224 million, bringing total capital return to $625 million,
compared to the $879 million of core earnings. Total capital return to shareholders was 71.1% of
core earnings in Q2 2021, and we are currently forecasting 82.8% and 80.2% in 2021 and 2022,
respectively.
· TRV recently made a minority investment in Fidelis and indicated it was small, given the level of
the investment was not disclosed. The Fidelis investment would give the company access to the
non-admitted market, and while it does bring some reinsurance exposure it does not change TRV's
overall view, which is that they are not looking to get bigger in reinsurance via M&A.
Premium Growth Benefited From Exposure Growth
· Net premiums written rose 10.7% (or 7.6% excluding personal auto refunds in the prior year),
smashing our 3.7% estimate and the +2.2% in the Q1 2021. Results were ahead of us in all
segments: Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty, and Personal Lines. Gross premiums written
growth of 10.9% was ahead of our 3.3% estimate and well above than the 3.1% last quarter.
· Business insurance net premiums written were up 5.4% (first positive growth in 4 quarters) versus
our flat growth estimate and -1.6% in the Q1. Bond & Specialty net premiums written were +16.3%
versus our +4.7% estimate and the +9.0% last quarter. Personal Insurance net premiums written
were +16.4% versus our +8.3% estimate and +6.6% last quarter. Within Personal Insurance, auto
net premiums written of +21.4% delivered a huge beat to our +4.7% estimate and well above
+2.3% last quarter although this growth would have been a more modest 4.2% when accounting
for the personal auto rebates last Q2, while home net premiums written growth of +12.2% was just
ahead of our +11.4% estimate and close to the +12.4% last quarter.

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for ALL: $135.00
Our price target of $135 represents around a 1.4x multiple on our 2022 book value per share estimate of approximately $97.
Risk for ALL
Risks to achieving the price target include large cat losses, regulatory constraints in key states, reserve strengthening, irrational
competition in personal lines, and deterioration in loss cost trends. Risks to the upside include margins continuing to see benefits from low
frequency and growth coming in above expectations.
Price Target for PGR: $87.00
Our $87 price target is based on: (1) about a 2.4x multiple of our 2022 GAAP book value estimate of around $36 per share and (2) just
under 17.5x our 2022 EPS estimate.
Risk for PGR
Risks to the upside include continued favorable frequency trends and stronger-than-anticipated premium growth.
Price Target for TRV: $159.00 from $155.00
Our price target of $159 is based on around a ~1.25x multiple of our projected 2022 book value estimate of around $127 and 13.0x our
2022 EPS estimate of $12.15.
Risk for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.
Investment Thesis
ALL
We believe the ALL shares are fairly valued as the company most likely has seen its margins peak. As ALL takes rate and pursues more
growth, we believe valuation expansion from here will be limited and rate its shares as Equal Weight as a result.
PGR
We have an Underweight rating on the shares. As Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out and driving picks up frequency should revert back to
more normalized levels, causing margin compression for PGR in 2021. Further, PGR's policy growth should slow as there is less shopping in
the market as virtually no players are pushing for rate due to the extremely low level of losses seen in 2020.
TRV
We believe that TRV will benefit from one of the hardest commercial pricing environment since 2003. Although we are positive on the
commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers due to its smaller account exposure and higher workers'
comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation, lower
reserve releases, and Covid-19, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral
and rate its shares as Equal Weight as a result.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities and Structured
Asset Investors, LLC ("SAI"), an investment adviser subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co. If you are paying directly for this research, it is being provided by SAI. For all other
recipients in the U.S. this report is being provided by Wells Fargo Securities.
Wells Fargo Securities' research department may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject
companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject
company's common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on
a subject company's common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the
subject company's common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental
investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary
to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to
maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual
investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in Wells Fargo
Securities research reports.
