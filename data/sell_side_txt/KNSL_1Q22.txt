Kinsale
1Q22: Another Strong Quarter, Positive Momentum
in Results to Persist
KNSL closed on another strong quarter with premium growth and
underwriting margins coming in above expectations. We consider Kinsale a
high-quality E&S franchise and expect it to perform well through the
underwriting cycle. Also, we expect its financial results to exhibit positive
momentum over the medium term as it unwinds excess reserves on its balance
sheet, continues to write business at favorable prices/terms, and benefits from
higher interest rates. Still, we remain Neutral on the stock given its valuation
as well as the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle continues
to moderate (albeit more gradually than we had initially expected).
· EPS beat. KNSL reported 1Q22 operating EPS of $1.63, above our $1.45
estimate and consensus of $1.52, with a lower loss ratio (57.4% vs. 60.0%E)
more than compensating for a higher expense ratio (21.6% vs. 21.2%E). Net
written premium growth was strong (+50.0% vs. +31.6%E). Within the loss
ratio attritional losses were higher (62.0% vs. 61.0%E), but lower
catastrophes (de minimis vs. 2.0%E) and higher reserve releases (PYD of -
4.7% vs. - 3.0%E) were a larger offset. Overall, the 1Q22 CR was 79.0% (vs.
81.2%E) and the AY CR was 83.6% (vs. 82.2%E). KNSL's results have
exceeded expectations for five consecutive quarters and we believe there
could be upside in our estimates from a lower loss ratio (AY loss ratio,
reserve releases), higher investment income, and premium growth.
· Operating conditions remained favorable in 1Q22. Similar to past
quarters KNSL attributed strong premium growth to higher submission
activity from brokers and more favorable pricing, a dynamic partly captured
by the company's disclosure on average premium per policy ($14,200 in
1Q22 vs. $12,300 in 1Q21). KNSL's disclosure indicates that while still
growing, submissions/quotes/bound policies have actually been increasing
at a slowing rate since 2019 (submissions +13% in 2021, +21% in 2020, and
+32% in 2019), implying that positive pricing and exposure growth have
been larger offsets considering that gross premium growth has stayed
roughly consistent at 40% over the same time period. Turning to reserves,
KNSL disclosed that the favorable development of $8.3 million in 1Q22
was largely driven by reserve releases from accident years 2020 and 2021
($10.1 million), partly offset by unfavorable development on accident years
2016-2018 ($2.0 million). KNSL's annual statutory filings indicate a faster
pace of reserve development for AY 2020 (8 points in year 1) compared to
AY 2017-2019 (3-5 points in year 1), and we believe that AY 2021 is likely
to carry a reserve cushion more similar to the former.
.. Morgan
· Similar to other insurers we expect investment income to be a source of
upside for Kinsale over time. KNSL's portfolio yield in 1Q22 was 2.5%
(4.6 year duration and average rating of AA-), below the 3%+ yield
available on comparable securities in the current environment.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small
commercial accounts. Our long-term outlook for KNSL is
upbeat given its large addressable market, superior technology
platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable
competitive advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full
and we are concerned about the risk of multiple compression
as the P&C pricing cycle continues to turn.

Please see Page 5 for tables
summarizing 1Q22 results.
KNSL will hold its earnings
conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern
on April 29, 2022.
The dial-in number for the call is
844-239-5282, code: 8992208.
The call replay will be available on
https://ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We maintain our Neutral rating. In our view, KNSL is well positioned to benefit
from the hard P&C market from both a volume and margin perspective. Also, we
think that its low-cost operating model is a sustainable competitive advantage in the
E&S market across the pricing cycle, especially against higher-cost competitors such
as Lloyd's writers. On the other hand, the stock's valuation seems full compared to
commercial peers and specialist names even after accounting for KNSL's growth
potential and above-average margins. Also, while favorable P&C market conditions
have persisted longer than we had initially anticipated and will have positive
implications for embedded margins, we believe that the eventual turn in the P&C
pricing cycle presents downside risk to its above-average multiple.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
We expect the E&S market, where KNSL operates exclusively, to see continued
strong new business flows and healthy price hikes in the near to medium term despite
a handful of major underwriters increasing their focus on growth. We believe this
favorable operating backdrop will give KNSL ample opportunities to continue
driving strong premium growth. Similarly, the combination of price hikes and
conservative reserving should allow KNSL to report healthy (and likely improving
margins) for the foreseeable future. Looking beyond the current hard market, we see
KNSL sustaining growth by continuing to build out its product offering, expanding
distribution, and gaining incremental market share from other insurers that have less
pricing flexibility to compete because of their much higher expense ratios.
Low Expenses a Durable Competitive Advantage
Kinsale operates with a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform that it
built from the ground up, in contrast to many of its peers that use unwieldy hybrid
systems consisting of legacy platforms and newer technologies. The net result has
been an operating model that has the capacity to take on significant business volumes
without sacrificing customer responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense
efficiency. We think that this operating leverage gives Kinsale the ability to
outperform higher cost competitors (especially Lloyd's platforms, which constitute
more than 20% of the E&S market) through the pricing cycle. During softer markets,
KNSL has the ability to grow premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-
average profitability. In hard markets, Kinsale can operate comfortably as a price
taker and generate an even larger excess return relative to other companies.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect price hikes to
continue moderating modestly through 2022 and 2023 as re/insurers re-position
themselves for growth and clients push back on rate-on-rate price hikes. This seems
to be reflected in multiples for commercial P&C names, which are essentially flat
versus pre-COVID-19 levels, but less so for specialist names like KNSL, which are
trading at a premium compared to historical levels. In our view, this presents the risk
of multiple compression as pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in E&S
given its function as a safety valve for the industry. Although we believe that KNSL
will thrive even if prices soften, our view is that a reasonable valuation analysis will
necessarily have to look several years out because of KNSL's above-average growth
profile (our reference year is 2024), and would therefore have to account for how
conditions in the P&C market are likely to be at that future time.

Raising Estimates
We are increasing our EPS estimates (2Q22 from $1.61 to $1.65, 2022 from $6.47
to $6.83, 2023 from $7.45 to $7.87) to reflect modest increases in our assumptions
for premium growth, margins/combined ratio, and investment income, partly offset
by higher interest expense on debt we assume KNSL will issue in 2H22.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $240.00)
Investment Thesis
KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates exclusively in the E&S
insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our long-term outlook
for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior technology
platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive advantage.
Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels and we are concerned about
the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle continues to moderate.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2022 price target from $225 to $240. Our
December 2022 target assumes a 4.8x P/BV target multiple on 2024 book value and
a 26.0x P/E target on 2024 EPS, which we believe is justified given KNSL's above-
average premium growth (+20% growth versus mid- to high-single-digit growth for
most large commercial peers) and margin profile (80-85% combined ratio versus 85-
90% for peers). KNSL trades at 6.9x book value, well above the specialty peer
average (ex. PLMR) of 2.0x and commercial peers at 1.6x.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher
prices and greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If
current conditions persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our
forecasts and investor sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We
would expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds
growth expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned
pricing exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving
suggests margin improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin
improvement tracks higher than expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are
beginning to push back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are
deploying capital and positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to
turn, we believe there is a risk of multiple compression for insurers that have seen
an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation re-emerge in casualty reserves.
Although unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and
low limits, the re-opening of the economy and the court system could drive a
surge in pent-up liability claims.

· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has
a strong underwriting track record and it is entering new lines of business in a
very strong part of the cycle. Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage,
the impact of badly underwritten risks is likely to persist.

period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the
average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's)
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of
the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected
total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it
does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
