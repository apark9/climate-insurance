2Q22 Earnings Review
The conversation continues with this quarter on the
intersection of rate, exposure growth and loss trend.

AIG
EQUAL WEIGHT
Unchanged
In an inflationary environment, we are trying to get a better angle on the relationship between
rate, exposure and loss trend. We were struck by AIG's characterization that its 6% loss trend
(upsized from 5.5% last quarter) looks more like 4% when taking into account 2 points of
exposure growth. Other P/C insurers include inflation exposed growth within pricing; additive to
pure rate (for AIG pure rate was down to 7% in 2Q from 8% in 1Q). While the avenue to get to
pricing vs. loss trend is different, the end result (spread between the two) looks the same. There
is elegance in simplification, the way AIG describes it is easy enough to understand and
thoughtful. However, an unintended consequence is possibly dilution of the underlying loss
trend. All investors may hear is, net loss trend is 4%, not bad. In contrast, higher loss trend
(without the exposure offset) bodes better with pricing agendas to brokers/insureds to extend
hard market cycle.
PCG Portfolio Update in Response to Catastrophe Developments, Inflation and Higher
Reinsurance Costs: AIG's high net worth property homeowners product to be offered on a non-
admitted basis in catastrophe prone states including CA. AIG will utilize a hybrid model - some
states may offer both admitted and non-admitted solutions, other states exclusively non-
admitted. We think that these accounts will not roll over easily to Lexington. A broker has to
prove that three admitted writers declined the risk. We can see take up by competition within
the admitted market with exceptions. CA is a displaced market, we can see a more likely
migration of risk to E&S. Likewise, AIG tends to offer large limits, not every insurer has the same
latitude. AIG is also exploring the use of third party capital to optimize PCG, a business that
remains core to AIG. We recognize AIG is already doing that to a degree with Syndicate 2019,
managed by Talbot.

AIG participated in the ULSG industry reserve study and in doing so does not anticipate to take
significant adjustments. AIG feels good about its assumptions, and its liabilities are less
weighted towards ULSG exposure ($3bn statutory reserves, though we think net amount at risk
is a better comparison point).

Asset allocation updates: AIG aspires for its investment portfolio to be less volatile. As such it
has reduced capital intensive assets to 8.5% from 10.5% of its portfolio. In 2Q, AIG sold $3.2bn of
RMBS and ABS securities. Likewise, AIG sold lower yielding, longer durated corporate bonds in
favor of higher yielding, shorter durated assets with a floating rate bias.
Corebridge IPO delayed, next window is September according to management. In the
meantime, AIG updated its expense cutting guide at Corebridge to $400mn over 3 years from
$200-$300mn.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
We view AIG as a wait-and-see proposition
as it goes down the complex path of
deconsolidation as well as ongoing
initiatives to achieve expense savings
objectives.
Upside case
USD 62.00
Eventual successful deconsolidation that
yields a fair market value resulting in a
rerating of AIG RemainCo. Our upside case
assumes ~10x our '23 EPS estimate.
Downside case
USD 48.00
Adverse reserve development
accompanying expansion of underwriting
risk appetite too fast too soon. Our
downside case assumes ~7.8x our '23 EPS
estimate.

Prior-Year Reserve Development
AIG's reserves releases were staggered amongst older accident years, with the largest
contribution coming from 2012 and prior. (AY20 slight adverse). LOBs callouts: WC and primary
casualty. On a gross basis, BRK was a recipient of favorable reserve development under its ADC
terms, in the amount of $213mn (based on 80% cede). AIG released $373mn of non-ADC
reserves in the quarter plus it recognized a $42mn amortization to arrive at its net favorable PYD
of $202mn in 2Q22. On a gross basis (had the ADC not been in place), AIG released even higher
than typical reserves in the quarter.
AIG reviewed 15% of its NA reserves in 2Q. AIG saw early indications of higher favorable PYD
within loss sensitive WC and U.S. primary FL, but chooses to be prudent. Next quarter AIG will
review 75% of its total pre-ADC reserves.
2Q Highlights
AIG earned a combined ratio < 90% for the first time since 2007, though we recognize lower
catastrophe losses and higher than typical favorable PYD played a piece. Also underwriting
gains outpaced NII. Fifth consecutive quarter with global commercial accident year combined
ratio, ex cats (AYCR) <90%. NA Commercial AYLR improved 3.7 pts y/y but on a sequential basis
it deteriorated by 70 bps to 63.3% from 62.6%. Results remain strong, we just think 1Q22 may be
the trough. GI NPW growth was flat y/y, with a drag mostly seen in international personal lines.
9 August 2022
4
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
Top line impacted by warranty products and re-underwriting efforts in PCG including
intentional non-renewals. However, on a FX constant basis GI NPW growth was 4.5%.
Similar to peers, AIG benefited from better mortality experience in the quarter and market-
related headwinds. We anticipate questions to be raised on its earnings call related to the
health of its ULSG reserves.
Key Results
EPS Beat: AIG's 2Q22 Operating EPS of $1.19 was above our $1.10 estimate and $1.09 consensus
Street estimate. The beat primarily reflects better-than-expected GI underwriting gains - mostly
from higher favorable PYD and lower catastrophe losses, better than expected buybacks,
somewhat offset by lower L&R earnings vs our estimates.
Underlying combined ratio of 88.5% vs. our estimated 88.7%.
BVPS (common) fell to $58.16 in 2Q22, from to $69.30 in 1Q22, mostly due to negative marks.
VII: Pre-tax alternative returns were $36mn (pre-tax) worse than AIG. Likewise, its FV change on
fixed maturity securities of $171mn is worse than AIG expected. We did not model below trend
VII.
Cat losses: $120mn (net of reinsurance) vs. our $297mn estimate.
Capital Management:
Parent liquidity was strong at $5.6bn at the end of the quarter, down from $9.1bn as of March
31, 2022. $1.7bn of buybacks completed (vs. our $1bn estimate) and AIG completed additional
debt tendering in the quarter.
Yield Enhancements from Rising Interest Rates
Asset duration: GI 4.0 years and L&R 8.4 years. We are assuming annual asset portfolio turnover
rates of 12.5% and 6%, respectively. Moving forward, new money yield is ~130 bps higher than
the current GI portfolio and 75 bps higher in L&R. Furthermore, for every 100 bps parallel shift in
the yield curve (we assume normal steep shape), NII increases by $500mn ($200mn in GI and
$300mn in L&R).
Valuation
Our Equal Weight rating and $56 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 9.0x our
2023 EPS estimate of $6.12 (down from $6.36) and 0.6x our 2023 book value per share (ex-AOCI)
estimate of $93.81 (up from $86.69). Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance
group given we expect lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Barclays | AIG, Inc.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
A: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has been lead manager or co-lead manager of a publicly disclosed offer of securities of AIG, Inc. in the previous
12 months.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
D: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. in the past 12 months.
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. within the
next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by AIG, Inc. and/or in any related derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from AIG, Inc. within the past 12 months.
L: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
N: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an

Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $56 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 9.0x our 2023 EPS estimate of $6.12
and 0.6x our 2023 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate of $93.81. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given we expect
lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a separation.
Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to walk away from
business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings or capital but
undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post separation may temper
AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.
