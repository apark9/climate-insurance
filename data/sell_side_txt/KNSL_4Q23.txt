4Q23 Follow Up: Raising EPS and Price Target, But
Remain Neutral on Valuation
With this follow up to KNSL's 4Q23 report on 2/15, earnings call on 2/16, and
10-K filing on 2/23, we are raising our EPS estimates and price target. 2024
EPS is increasing by +5% (from $15.49 to $16.29), 2025 EPS by +7% (from $19.09
to $20.40), and our price target is moving from $375 to $420. In our view, the
favorable P&C trading environment continues to offer a best-in-class E&S
operator such as KNL the opportunity to outpace peers on growth and margins. In
particular, we think that gross premium growth of mid-20s or higher in 2024 is
achievable. Nevertheless, we remain Neutral on KNSL because of valuation,
especially after the sharp uptick in the stock following the 4Q23 print.
· Raising earnings estimates. Following our review of KNSL's model and the
10-K released on 2/23 (the company's 4Q23 earnings call was on 2/16), we are
increasing EPS (1Q24 from $3.42 to $3.59, 2024 from $15.49 to $16.29, 2025
from $19.09 to $20.40, 2026 from $22.43 to $24.53). As summarized in Table
1 below, our EPS estimates are increasing by 5-9% across the 2024-2026
projection period. The key changes in our model include: (1) higher yields on
invested assets, to reflect KNSL's new money yield in the mid-5% range and
its ~3 year asset duration (2-7% benefit to operating EPS) and (2) higher
underwriting income from a roughly 90 bps improvement in the combined
ratio, partly offset by lower net earned premium growth (2-3% net benefit to
operating EPS). The lower net earned premium growth is from the flow-
through of lower gross premium growth in 4Q23 as well as a lower assumed
retention ratio because of KNSL's greater use of reinsurance. Our picks for
gross premium growth through 2024-2026 are unchanged (27%, 20%, and
14%, respectively), reflecting our assumption of healthy but moderating
growth as KNSL approaches its expected long-term run rate of 10-20%.
Consistent with past practice, as we approach quarter-end, we intend to further
review our quarterly gross premium growth estimate for the upcoming
reporting period based on data from the state surplus lines offices.
. In our view, the P&C environment continues to be a tailwind for KNSL's
growth and margins. The P&C trading environment remains broadly
favorable for KNSL, with the property market still firm (notwithstanding the
potential for some moderation in 2H24) and the reserving issues plaguing
casualty writers likely to be supportive of pricing. Against this backdrop, we
think that our 27% gross premium growth assumption in 2024 is reasonable off
42% growth in 2023 and 44% in 2022, with the decline mainly driven by a still
healthy but more slowly growing property business. With respect to margins,
we are assuming a flat attritional loss ratio (57.4% in 2024, same as 2023 and
2022), a roughly 1.5% catastrophe load, and a favorable but declining impact
from prior year development (-2.5% in 2024 and -2.1% in 2025 compared to
-3.3% in 2023). We are also assuming modest operating leverage off a 20.8%
expense ratio in 2023 (expense ratio of 20.6% in 2024 and 20.5% in 2025).

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded
P&C insurer that operates exclusively in the E&S insurance
market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our long-
term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable
market, superior technology platform, and low cost base, which
we view as a sustainable competitive advantage. Still, the stock's
valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle
moderates.

potential for some modest upside. We triangulate our 2024 gross premium growth pick
using (1) premium data by product line and (2) policies-in-force and average premium
data. Looking at statutory data through 3Q23 (full year 2023 is not available yet), KNSL's
property book was 33% of overall premiums and was up 128% from the same period in
2022. Casualty business, which represents 67% of premiums, was up 24% from 2022. As
we think through 2024, we sensitize various growth combinations for property and
casualty business (see Tables 2 and 3) and find that casualty growth of 15-25% (versus
growth of 24% in 2023 and 31% in 2022) and property growth of 30-40% (versus growth
of 106% in 2023 and 118% in 2022) will produce overall 2024 GPW growth in the 20-
30% range. When analyzed using per policy data and average premium size, we arrive
at the same conclusion. The combination of KNSL's policies-in-force growing by 15-
20% a year, coupled with average premiums growing high-single-digits ("real rate" of
5%, which represents a pricing spread over mid-single-digit loss trends), leads to gross
premium growth comfortably in the mid-20s range (see Table 4).
. Our view is that KNSL's reserves are conservative, but we disagree with the opinion
of some investors that significant excess reserves can be used to explain or justify
KNSL's current valuation. Overall, KNSL's 2015-2019 casualty reserves have held up
well, with deterioration in product liability (occurrence) more than offset by favorability
in general liability lines (occurrence and claims made). Disclosure on KNSL's loss
reserve triangles from the 10-K are consistent with this trend. In particular, 2023 reserve
movements were favorable overall, with unfavorable development in the liability
occurrence book more than offset by favorable development in the property and the
liability claims made books. Despite KNSL's strong reserve position, we are of the view
that any reasonable analysis would suggest that at best, the value of excess reserves not
yet in earnings potentially accounts for a mid-single-digit percentage of market cap, or
anywhere from $7-21 of value per share (see Table 5). On the other hand, given KNSL's
high trading multiple, we believe the stock could materially underperform if reserves
prove to be deficient (although we do not expect this).
. We are raising our price target from $375 to $420 given our higher EPS and book value
estimates. Our price target is roughly 17x 2026 EPS of $24.53. Our multiple of 17x
corresponds to a roughly 1x PEG ratio for KNSL in 2026 (assuming run-rate mid to high-
teens growth), consistent with the 1x PEG of commercial P&C writers on high-single-
digit run-rate EPS growth and a high-single-digit P/E multiple on 2026 earnings. KNSL's
current stock price either implies a higher multiple on our baseline earnings for 2026 (20x
vs. our 17x assumption) or assumes 40% gross premium growth per year through 2026;
we find either assumption to be overly generous (see Tables 6 and 7).

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale (Neutral; Price Target: $420.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our
long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior
technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2024 price target from $375 to $420 to reflect our higher
EPS and book value estimates. Our price target assumes a 5x multiple on 2025 BV and a 20x
multiple on 2025 operating income. These target multiples are well above peers', which we
think is supported by KNSL's above-average premium growth (mid-teens growth versus
mid- to high-single-digit growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile (high
70s to low 80s CR versus 85-90% for peers). KNSL trades at 10.8x BV, well above specialty
peers (ex. PLMR) of 2.5x and commercial peers at 1.8x. On 2024E earnings, KNSL trades
at 31x versus 14x for specialty insurers (ex. PLMR) and 12x for commercial insurers.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher prices and
greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If current conditions
persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our forecasts and investor
sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We would
expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds growth
expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving suggests margin
improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin improvement tracks higher than
expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are pushing
back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are deploying capital and
positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to turn, there is a risk of multiple
compression for insurers that have seen an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation reemerge in casualty reserves. Although
unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and low limits, the
reopening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up liability claims.
· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has a
strong underwriting track record, and it is entering new lines in a strong part of the cycle.

Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage, the impact of badly underwritten
risks is likely to persist. Also, inflation is a risk for both casualty and property coverages.

J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
