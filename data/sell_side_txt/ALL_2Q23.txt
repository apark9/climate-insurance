2Q23 Review: Capital Management
Gravity Shift
ALL recognized $3.1bn of statutory losses over the last 18
months. In relation to capital adequacy, we sense a posture
shift, with a greater sense of urgency now to get back on track,
after a relatively more relaxed posture previously. Those efforts
do not include an equity raise.

Potential Upside/Downside
+2.8%
CA, NY and NJ, tougher states to get needed rate approvals, represent 24% of ALL's 2022 auto
premiums vs. 21% for the industry. Collectively, new issued applications in these states fell by
62%. ALL's 35% rate request (vs. 46.4% actuarial rate need) in CA is still pending and could drag
on for a pro-longed period of time. We venture it could take 12 months. ALL implemented 3 pts
of weighted rate increases in June in NY. In NJ it received a 6.9% rate approval and is awaiting a
29% pending rate increase for a requested effective date of Dec. '23 (renewal business).
ALL's reported 82.3% AYLR for auto deteriorated from 82.1% in 1Q23. In Figure 1, we outline
ALL's auto underlying loss ratio adjusted for these inter-quarter estimates to better depict its
quarterly trend. ALL's 12.5% 'pure premium' trend is synonymous with 'underlying loss
trend' (11 pts severity, 1.5 pts frequency). This compares to 10.7% in 1Q. Therefore,
underlying loss trends are progressively getting worse. Nonetheless, higher earned in premiums
from rating actions are coming through over time, boosting the denominator.

Testing the limits to satisfy all stakeholders: Managing capital for efficiency comes at a price.
We get the sense that ALL tries to make all of its key stakeholders including regulators, rating
agencies, and equity investors, happy. By doing so, ALL just runs capital very efficiently, which in
translation means a lesser buffer or even a slight deficiency. While ALL may have been testing
the limits to a degree, we think actions taken to date are sufficient to get capital adequacy
back on track.
Buyback Shareholder Value Creation
" ... when you look ... over a long period of time ...
you don't really create shareholder value by
doing share buybacks."
- Tom Wilson, CEO
While ALL acknowledges that not doing any buybacks is bad for shareholder value, ALL is more
focused on returning profitability. We sense a shift in posture. Before ALL's July buyback
suspension, we have seen more buyback consistency from ALL even in periods when it
completed acquisitions or elevated catastrophe activity. We take ALL's comments to mean that
it values capital flexibility more than being consistent over the long term.
Capital Actions
Buyback suspension since July, ALL reiterated it does not feel like it needs to issue equity. The
old playbook for ALL when capital got tighter was to raise hybrid debt, that option we think is
less available given its current leverage position and expensive pricing. We are modeling nil
buybacks in 2H23 and 2024.
ALL reduced its public equities position (that carry higher capital requirements under its
internal capital model) in 1H23. This follows its reduction of HY bonds in 2Q22. We assume
asset reallocation from HY/equities to IG bonds yielded ~$1bn of capital relief (under S&P's
proposed new capital model proposal).

Evolving auto capital requirements: In light of weaker underwriting performance, ALL raised
its internal capital requirements for auto, which we interpret as higher capital needs for auto
underwriting and reserving risks.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
ALL's fundamentals are strong and
we look forward to seeing progress
on its transformative growth plan.
However, pricing correction actions
may stall ALL's progress in
actualizing stronger PIF growth.
Upside case
USD 130.00
Loss cost trends abate, returning to
2019 baseline levels. Successful
execution of Allstate's
transformational growth plans via
efficiency gains that is translated to
strong PIF growth, particularly in
auto. Our upside case of $130
assumes ~2x our '24 BVPS ex AOCI
estimate.
Downside case
USD 100.00
Steeper acceleration of loss cost
trends, particularly on the severity
side. Prolonged period of achieving
approvals from regulators with
respect to requested rate increases.
Our downside case of $100 assumes
~10x our '24 EPS estimates.

PF Capital: 2H Statutory Losses Illustrative
Scenarios
In our downside scenarios we are assuming a continuation of statutory losses in the balance of
the year. Scenario #1 - $1bn of incremental statutory losses and Scenario #2 - $2bn of
incremental statutory losses for 2H23. Consequently, Hold Co liquidity falls to $2.6bn and
$1.6bn, respectively, from $3.3bn at 2Q23.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within
the next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or

Valuation Methodology: Our $113 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended 10.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.78x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
