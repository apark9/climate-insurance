Kinsale
4Q22 Earnings: A Strong Quarter Suggests More of the
Same to Come, But Valuation Seems Full; Neutral
KNSL reported a strong 4Q22 and we expect its financial results to exhibit positive
momentum over the medium term. Kinsale is a high-quality E&S franchise that is
benefiting from the current environment but should also perform well through the
underwriting cycle. Still, we remain Neutral on the stock given its valuation and
the risk of multiple compression when P&C pricing eventually turns.
· EPS above expectations. KNSL reported 4Q22 operating EPS of $2.60, well
above our $2.10 estimate and consensus of $2.13. KNSL's underwriting
margins were higher than our model (CR 72.4% vs. 78.3%E or +$0.48 per
share), driven by favorable attritional (55.6% vs. 59.0%E) and expense (19.9%
vs. 20.5%E) ratios. Reserve releases were a touch lower (-3.3% vs. - 3.5%E) but
were more than offset by lower catastrophe losses (0.2% vs. 2.3%E). The 4Q22
core combined ratio (ex. cats and PYD) was 75.5%, down from 78.6% in 4Q21
and better than our 79.5% assumption. Investment income was stronger as well
(+$0.15 per share vs. our model), driven by strong operating cash flows and
higher new money rates. Of note, KNSL was able to reduce the duration of its
investment portfolio in 2022, from 4.3 years at 12/31/21 to 3.5 years at
12/31/22, while improving yields from 2.5% to 3.0%. Net written premiums of
$242.1 million rose +36.4% from 4Q21 vs. our +34.1% assumption.
· Raising EPS estimates. We are increasing 1Q23 EPS from $2.07 to $2.23 and
2023 EPS from $9.18 to $9.97. We think KNSL's very strong 4Q22 attritional
loss ratio of 55.6% benefited from management's practice of setting more
conservative loss picks earlier in the year and unwinding part of the buffer in
the second half. Thus, in our opinion, 4Q22 is not a good base for 2023 and the
full year 2022 AY loss ratio of 58.8% is a better starting point. With respect to
expenses, management's commentary on cost control suggests scope for
improvement in an already very strong 2022 expense ratio of 20.2%.
· Multiple drivers of upside for KNSL given favorable operating
environment, but valuation seems full. These drivers include: (1) premium
growth - we are assuming 20% gross premium growth from 2023-2025 vs.
+40% historical growth from 2019-2022, management commentary seems to
suggest stronger growth prospectively; (2) AY loss ratio - we are assuming a
flattish ratio in 2023 vs. 2022, but a positive pricing spread in 2023 could
reduce it further; (3) expense ratio -we are also assuming a flattish ratio in 2023
vs. 2022, which again could be conservative given management's focus on cost
control ; (4) investment income-scope for upside from organic growth, higher
yields, and at some point potentially increasing duration. However, our
concern is that KNSL still trades at a significant premium vs. the sector even
after giving it credit for most of these benefits. Also, although the stock could
justifiably trade at a permanent (albeit lower) premium versus peers for
structural reasons (high quality franchise, above-average growth), we believe
its current valuation multiple has an embedded benefit from the favorable P&C
environment, which is not permanent and will eventually deteriorate.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly
traded P&C insurer that operates exclusively in the E&S
insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts.
Our long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large
addressable market, superior technology platform, and low
cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current
levels and we are concerned about the risk of multiple
compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2023 price target from $270
to $290 given the increase in our EPS estimates. Our price
target assumes a 4.3x P/BV target multiple on 2025 book
value and a 20x P/E target on 2025 EPS. These target
multiples are well above peers', which we believe is
supported by KNSL's above-average premium growth (long-
term low-to-mid teens growth versus mid-to-high single-digit
growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile
(high 70s to low 80s CR versus 85- 90% for peers). KNSL
trades at 9.0x BV, well above the specialty peer average (ex.
PLMR) of 2.1x and commercial peers at 1.8x.

Investment Thesis
Please see Page 5 for tables
summarizing 4Q22 results. KNSL will
hold its earnings conference call at 9:00
AM Eastern on February 17, 2022. The
dial-in number for the call is 888-660-
6493; code: 3573726. The call replay will
be available on https://
ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We affirm our Neutral rating. We expect KNSL's premiums and margins to benefit
from favorable trends in the E&S market, which continues to generate outsized growth
at attractive pricing/terms. Also, we think that Kinsale's low-cost operating model is a
sustainable competitive advantage across the pricing cycle, especially against higher
cost competitors like Lloyd's writers. On the other hand, the stock's valuation is full
compared to commercial peers and specialist names even after accounting for KNSL's
growth potential and above-average margins. Furthermore, while favorable P&C market
conditions are likely to persist through 2023 and will have positive implications for
KNSL's reserves and future earnings, the eventual turn in the P&C pricing cycle is a
downside risk to its above-average multiple.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
We expect the overall E&S market, where KNSL operates exclusively, to see strong but
moderating new business flows and price hikes over time, partly due to more
underwriters focusing on growth and greater appetite from admitted markets. Still, we
think KNSL can grow premiums at a healthy pace because of its relatively small base as
well as the fragmented nature of the pricing cycle whereby certain lines (property,
marine) are only beginning to benefit from harder prices despite a slowdown in other
lines and/or the broader market. With respect to profitability, we expect the combination
of price hikes - historical and prospective - and conservative reserving to support
healthy margins at KNSL over the medium term.
Low Cost Operating Model a Durable Competitive Advantage
KNSL has a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform that it built from the
ground up, in contrast to its peers that use unwieldy hybrid systems consisting of legacy
platforms and newer technologies. The net result has been an operating model that has
the capacity to take on significant business volumes without sacrificing customer
responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense efficiency. With this model, our view
is that KNSL will outperform higher cost competitors (especially Lloyd's which is more
than 20% of the E&S market) through the pricing cycle. During softer markets, KNSL
can grow premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-average profitability.
In hard markets, Kinsale can be a price taker and generate an even larger excess return.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect overall price hikes
to moderate as re/insurers re-position themselves for growth (property and catastrophe
coverage likely to be the exception in the near term). Given this, we see multiple
compression as a risk as pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in E&S given
its function as a safety valve for P&C. Although we believe that some portion of recent
market share gains by the E&S industry are permanent and that KNSL will thrive even
if prices soften, our view is that a reasonable valuation analysis will have to look several
years out because of KNSL's above-average growth profile and would therefore have to
account for how conditions in the P&C market are likely to be at that future time.

Kinsale (Neutral; Price Target: $290.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our
long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior
technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2023 price target from $270 to $290 given the increase in
our EPS estimates. Our price target assumes a 4.3x P/BV target multiple on 2025 book value
and a 20x P/E target on 2025 EPS. These target multiples are well above peers', which we
believe is supported by KNSL's above-average premium growth (long-term low-to-mid
teens growth versus mid-to-high single-digit growth for most large commercial peers) and
margin profile (high 70s to low 80s CR versus 85- 90% for peers). KNSL trades at 9.0x BV,
well above the specialty peer average (ex. PLMR) of 2.1x and commercial peers at 1.8x.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher prices and
greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If current conditions
persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our forecasts and investor
sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We would
expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds growth
expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving suggests margin
improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin improvement tracks higher than
expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are pushing
back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are deploying capital and
positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to turn, there is a risk of multiple
compression for insurers that have seen an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation re-emerge in casualty reserves. Although
unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and low limits, the
re-opening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up liability claims.
· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has a
strong underwriting track record and it is entering new lines in a strong part of the cycle.
Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage, the impact of badly underwritten
risks is likely to persist. Also, inflation is a risk for both casualty and property coverages.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average
total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect
this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.]
Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's
(or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this
stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable,
the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country
market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying
analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
