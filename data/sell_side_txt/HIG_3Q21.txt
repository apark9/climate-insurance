3Q EPS: Strong Execution
Our conviction on management execution and business fundamentals is augmenting and the
3Q print left us with a lot to be excited about. While HIG's small commercial lines has always
been its sweet spot, the company is out delivering in middle markets and global specialty,
which speaks to management delivery. We had said at our initiation on HIG (U.S.
Insurance/Non-Life: Oh, the Places You'll Go! Initiating Coverage on U.S. Non-Life Insurance
16 Nov 20), that HIG's superior enterprise risk management function would turn Navigators
around and we discussed the strategic nature of the ADC it entered. HIG's personal lines book
has different characteristics than the mass market but still it is not immune to the
accumulation of loss trend. We think the industry will not reach an inflection point on the
pricing front for another 12-18 months, recognizing that there are state by state dynamics.
We recognize that HIG's AY margin expansion in commercial lines y/y ahead of peers
(excluding COVID) - and think motivation to deliver is high. Our primary focus is looking at
how 2021 initial incurred loss picks compare to prior periods to see how much conservatism
management exerts into its reserving. We have done work on schedule P analysis (U.S.
Insurance/Non-Life: Inflation Risk: Reserves and Loss Cost Trends 27 May 21) we will update
when schedule Ps are available in April/May 2022. Management is confident that they are
achieving rate ahead of loss trend and behind the scenes they are doing work on segmentation
and industry focus efforts that we will learn more about at their Investor Day.
We are not building in a M&A premium in our valuation as we believe in the fundamentals of
the business and think that management's strong delivery of its plan lowers the likelihood of
a takeout scenario. Some of our other conversations with investors have been a sale of the
group benefits business potentially unlocking value. We don't anticipate that's on
management's agenda, there are cross-overs on the claims side between WC and disability.
We reiterate our Overweight rating on HIG and increase our PT to $85 (from $76) reflecting
a 50/50 weighting of 13x (up from 12x) our '22E EPS of $7.17 (up $0.41) and 1.4x (up from
1.3x) our '22E BVPS ex AOCI of $54.25 (from $53.63).

Why Overweight? HIG has sound fundamentals
following transformation which should cont. to drive
a stronger book multiple. ROE convergence with
peers should make current valuation look
inexpensive. Navigators acquisition is becoming more
accretive given boost from hard pricing in specialty
lines. HIG has accelerated the pace of its expense
savings plans.
Upside case
USD 95.00
Our upside case reflects stronger than expected
underwriting margin expansion and commercial P&C
pricing levels. Our upside case is ~13x '22E EPS.
Downside case
USD 65.00
Our downside case assumes unsuccessful
underwriting margin expansion and expense savings
as well as slowdown in the commercial P&C renewal
rate environment. Our downside case is ~9x '22E EPS.

P&C premiums growth in commercial lines drives top line; offsets y/y premium
decline in personal lines
P&C net written premiums were $3,297mn (10.6% y/y) vs. our estimate of $3,057mn
(+2.6%) on mid-teens growth (15.1% y/y) in commercial which exceeded our estimate
($2,532mn vs. our estimate of $2,295mn) and offset declining y/y written premium growth
of -2% in personal lines that was mostly in-line with our estimate ($765mn vs. our estimate
of $762mn).
Commercial Lines
Commercial written premiums growth reflects higher audit and endorsement premiums, an
increase in new business across all segments, higher policy retention in Middle Market and
broad strength across lines of business for renewal written price increases, particularly in
Global Specialty and Middle Market.

Barclays | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Over the last two quarters HIG's commercial premium growth has been driven by a low to
mid-teens y/y increases in Small Commercial and Middle Market (Figure 1) boosted by a
healthier economy.

Middle markets retention jumped to 87% in 3Q21 (vs. 82% in 2Q21, 80% in 1Q21, and 77%
in 4Q20). In contrast, small commercial retention seems to have plateaued at 84%, its level
since 1Q21.
Commercial Underwriting Detail
The Middle & Large Commercial underlying combined ratio of 91.4% improved y/y by 6.3
pts primarily due to a lower CAY loss ratio pre Cats and COVID losses driven by workers'
compensation and general liability, a 1.6 pt decrease in COVID losses. The expense ratio also
decreased 0.3 pts.
Small Commercial underlying combined ratio at 83.9% better y/y by 3.8 pts due to lower
CAY loss ratio pre Cats and COVID losses in workers' compensation, lower non-CAT property
losses. Also a 0.5 pt drop in the expense ratio and a 0.5 pt decrease in COVID losses.
Global Specialty underlying combined ratio of 86.9% improved by 11.3 pts y/y due to a lower
CAY loss ratio pre Cats and COVID losses in several lines, including international, Global Re,
U.S. wholesale and U.S. financial lines, as well as a 3.3 pts decrease in COVID losses and a 2.0
pt fall in the expense ratio.

Personal Lines
The written premiums y/y decrease of ~2% primary driven by the effect of non-renewed
premium exceeding new business in auto and homeowners, partially offset by higher renewal
written price increases of 8.1% in homeowners in 3Q21. However, the renewal written price
increases in homeowners continued a downward slide (+8.5% in 2Q21, +9.4% in 1Q21 and
+8.7% in 4Q20) relative to the prior three quarters.
Efforts underway to turn around PIF growth in personal lines: As of 3Q21, the negative y/y
growth trend in PIF across auto and home continues (Figure 2). We think HIG's ongoing
rollout of its personal lines auto and home product (Prevail) is worth watching, though early
contributions may be on the margin. Prevail has been rolled out to 7 states to date and is
expected in 9 states within the next 90 days. The latest iteration of Prevail launched in October
features enhancements to auto/home bundling and telematics capabilities. On the latter, HIG
is partnering with Cambridge Mobile to fine tune driving models based on driving behavior.
Prevail is currently a direct, AARP-dedicated product.
The 10-year extension (here) of the auto and home insurance program between HIG and
AARP positioned HIG to make a long-term investment in modernizing product and improving
user experience in a growing demographic. PIF growth directly stemming from the product
modernization isn't likely to materialize until beyond 2022 when the product is more broadly
rolled out across the country.

Personal Underwriting Detail
The auto underlying combined ratio of 99.7% was up 14.8 pts y/y on higher auto frequency
resulting from an increase in miles driven (Figure 3) and elevated severity, as well as a higher
expense ratio. Auto severity is elevated driven largely by the rising cost of used cars,
replacement parts and labor. Severity headwinds being experienced broadly across the
industry are expected to persist into 2022.
Seasonally adjusted vehicle miles driven (indicator of auto frequency trends) dipped
sequentially (-2% vs. July 2021) in August, but are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. Y/Y
miles driven were up +8.5% (+20.4 billion vehicle miles) vs. August 2020. Quarter to date, we
have evidence from PGR (Sept '21: Feeling Fatigue), TRV (3Q21 Earnings: All About Timing),
Kemper (pg. 10 of 3Q21 earnings presentation) and HIG of continued pressure on underlying
auto loss ratios. Per our modelling changes, we have updated our assumption for HIG's
personal lines underlying loss ratio, which we had expected to revert to the mid-60s. We now
expect the underlying losses to be ~170bps and ~200bps higher in 2022E and 2023E,
respectively.

Excess mortality impact driven
higher as impact to younger
demographic elevates claims
severity
The homeowners underlying combined ratio of 74.6% was up 0.6 pts y/y primarily due to a
higher expense ratio. Favorable frequency relative to expectations are offsetting increased
claim severity from higher building material and labor costs.
Group Benefits
Core earnings of $19mn decreased from $116mn in 3Q20 primarily reflecting an increase in
excess mortality related to Covid-19. Core earnings margin of 1.2% (below 2021E outlook
range of 3.7%-4.7%) on excess mortality from Covid-19 of $212mn pre-tax which was above
our estimated $90mn pre-tax impact. In 3Q21, excess mortality had 10.6 pts of drag on core
earnings margin. Severity was driven higher on a y/y basis (+49%) for the first nine months
of 2021 as a younger portion of the population (Figure 4) is impacted (resulting in elevated
claims (avg. claim severity is 4x higher for someone under 65 years of age vs. over 65 years
of age). Covid-19 related short-term disability claims were an additional 0.8 pt headwind to
core margin.

Context for Underlying Commercial Margin Improvement
Commercial lines underlying margin improved ~6.5 pts y/y. The y/y improvement consisted
of ~5 pts (1.5 pts of y/y change is Covid) from the loss ratio as the majority of lines are earning
in positive rate change. ~ 1 pt of underlying improvement came from expenses.
Workers Compensation was a positive rate contributor (+1.2%) in 3Q (Figure 5) but pricing
headwinds on the horizon toward the end of '22 and into '23 as AY '20 becomes part of the
experience period (3-years in most states). HIG thinks workers compensation pricing will not
really turn positive until the end of '22.

3Q21 vs. Target Financial Plan
Commercial lines (87.2% underlying CR) better than 2021E outlook range while personal
lines (91.8% underlying CR) and Group Benefits (1.2% core earnings margin) lagged 2021E
outlook range in the quarter. Share repurchases were ahead of our estimate in 3Q21 ($511mn
actual vs. $250mn estimate) and the increased authorization (+$500mn) now sets 2022E
repurchases to be consistent with 2021E ($1.5bn). We are modelling better underlying
commercial lines margins in 2022 than HIG plan and worse personal lines (due to rising lost
trend) and lower group benefit margins in 2022 as the COVID curve looks worse than when
management came up with its plan.

Forward Looking Commentary
· Repurchase authorization increased to $3bn and will remain effective through the end of
2022. As a result of the increase (from $2.5bn), ~$1.7bn remains under the authorization
as of October 27, 2021. The company has repurchased ~$108mn, or ~1.5mn common
shares. The additional buyback capacity should enable 2022E repurchases to closely
mirror 2021E outlook ($1.5bn).
· M&A remains a low priority relative to organic initiatives. Ranking M&A toward lower end
of priorities factored into increasing buyback authorization by $500mn.
· Dividend payable in January 2022 +10% ($0.385 per common share vs. $0.35 prior).
· Agreement in principle with the BSA expected to become final upon occurrence of certain
conditions early in 2022.
· Hartford Next run rate savings tracking to plan. Slight increase to expected savings in
2021E (to $400mn from $390mn). No change to full year pre-tax savings in 2022E
($540mn) and 2023E ($625mn).
· Proceeds from $600mn September issuance (2.9% Sr. Notes due 2051) will be used to
redeem in full $600mn outstanding of 7.875% Jr. Sub Debt due 2042 (redeemable at par
on or after April 15, 2022).
· Group Benefits excess mortality from Covid-19: Experiencing elevated severity (+49% y/y
YTD 2021) driven by higher claims from the younger age cohorts being impacted. Effects
expected to linger for the next 2 quarters.
· Holdco cash/investments (includes $600mn of proceeds from Sept Sr. Note issuance) of
$2.1bn as of September 30, 2021, up from $1.7bn at June 30, 2021. 3Q21 subsidiary
dividends of $443mn, and expecting $445mn in 4Q21.
. Reinsurance: 2021 Agg Property Cat Treaty has slightly less than ~$50mn of losses
remaining until reaching $700mn attachment point. The treaty then covers $200mn of
qualifying cat losses.
Model Updates
Estimate Update
Our operating EPS is now $5.80 in 2021E (prior $5.29), $7.17 in 2022E (prior $6.76) and $8.44
in 2023E (prior $7.61). Our updated book value per share ex AOCI for YE22E is $54.25 (prior
$53.63).

Model updates: We've incorporated the following model changes post 3Q21.
· Inclusion of 3Q21 actuals.
· Increasing commercial written premium growth assumptions in our forecast in (+6.0% in
2022E and +3.3% in 2023E). We're now assuming ~10.5% y/y and ~6.4% y/y NWP
growth in 2022E and 2023E, respectively. The changes are primarily driven by increased
expectations in Small Commercial and Middle Market & Large Commercial.
· Improved underlying loss ratio assumptions in commercial by 2.7 pts (2022E) and 3.0 pts
(2023E).
· Decreasing personal written premium growth assumptions in our forecast by -1.8 pts in
2022E to -1.7% y/y (-2% y/y in auto and -1% y/y in home). We expect auto and home
premiums to continue declining on a quarterly basis through 4Q23. Our expectations in
2023E are for a y/y decline of -2% in auto (vs. - 6.9% prior) and -1% in home (vs. +2%
prior).
· We've increased our underlying loss ratio assumptions in personal lines to 66.4% in
2022E (vs. 64.7% prior) and 66.5% in 2023E (vs. 64.5% prior).
· In Group Benefits, we expect Covid-19 excess mortality impact to linger for longer and
also take into account the higher severity caused by shifting demographics. We have
raised expected losses through 2Q22. We now expect core earnings margin of 5.1% in
2022E (vs. 7% prior).
· Our core earnings run rate in Hartford Funds is now $155mn in 2022E (vs. $172mn prior)
and $ 144mn in 2023E (vs. $182mn prior). The driver of the change is lower than modelled
AUM in 3Q21 primarily driven by lower than estimate change in market value in Mutual
Funds.
· Increasing share repurchase assumption in 2022E to $1.5bn (vs. $1bn prior).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative
(see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully
read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $85 price target for HIG reflects a 50/50 weighting of 13x '22 EPS of $7.17 and 1.4x '22 P/B ex AOCI of $53.25.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.
