TRV: Loss Trend Smacks The Umbrella Again;
Conference Call Round-Up
. Summary. TRV hosted its Q2 conference call this morning. The call
was broad ranging with a focus on commercial lines pricing, its
higher loss trend assumption, reserve development, capital and
investments. Our 2020 EPS estimate goes to $9.25 (from $8.90) as
higher other investment income in the Q3, continued favorable
personal auto margins in the Q3 (although not as strong as the Q2),
more than offset lower fixed income investment income and lower
level of prior year reserve development. Our 2021 and 2022 EPS
estimates are unchanged at $9.95 and $10.60 and our price target
remains $112. The TRV shares traded down owing to the higher loss
trend within commercial lines in the quarter, in our view.
. Higher loss picks takes the stock down. TRV had an OK quarter
with the underlying margin being driven by personal auto, and the
reserves developing adversely within management liability and
general liability/commercial multi-peril. Covid-19 losses were modest
(and the net impact after favorable frequency was minimal), while
natural cat losses were high (the Q2 is typically its highest cat loss
quarter) and pricing momentum continued to build (double-digit
rates away from workers' comp). However, we think the market took
a negative reaction to the quarter due to one number - the 0.5%
increase to its loss picks within Business Insurance (bringing its
trend to 5.0% in BI). The 5.0% is still below price (up 7.4% in BI
including rate declines in workers' comp) but reinforced that TRV has
had to add to its loss trend, when others have not. Before this
quarter TRV had taken up its loss trend assumption to 4.5% last Q2.
At this point we are assuming that the higher trend is confined to
TRV and do think other insurers (including CB next week) should get
a lift on earnings as they point to better commercial lines pricing.
· Pricing momentum building. The combination of weather-related
losses, historically low interest rates, higher loss trend in liability
lines, the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic contraction
have Travelers comparing this market to the one after 9/11 and
Hurricane Katrina. This supports our bullish pricing view. Further,
TRV pointed to being close to the trough of the workers' comp cycle.
This is all good but is counter-balanced by the higher loss trend
within their business insurance book. For TRV's underlying BI
margins to improve they would need to see rate continue at these
levels, without a corresponding increase in loss trend.
. Other takes for the group. TRV left a bullish view on the level of
workers' comp related Covid-19 losses slowing, combined with
maintaining its stance that it should largely be immune from
Business Interruption losses from the pandemic, and pointed to
conserving capital and potentially still remain muted on buybacks
given the economic uncertainty and the fact that we are in hurricane
season. See inside note for additional takes for the sector.

Q2 2020 Earnings And Conference Call Highlights
Summary. TRV hosted its Q2 conference call this morning. The call was broad ranging with a focus on
commercial lines pricing, its higher loss trend assumption, reserve development, capital and investments.
TRV had an OK quarter with the underlying margin being driven by personal auto, and the reserves
developing adversely within management liability and general liability/commercial multi-peril. Covid-19
losses were modest (and the net impact after favorable frequency was minimal), while natural cat losses
were high (the Q2 is typically its highest cat loss quarter) and pricing momentum continued to build
(double-digit rates away from workers' comp). However, we think the market took a negative reaction to
the quarter due to one number - the 0.5% increase to its loss picks within Business Insurance (bringing
its trend to 5.0% in BI). Our 2020 EPS estimate goes to $9.25 (from $8.90) as higher other investment
income in the Q3, continued favorable personal auto margins in the Q3 (although not as strong as the
Q2), more than offset lower fixed income investment income and lower level of prior year reserve
development. Our 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates are unchanged at $9.95 and $10.60 and our price target
remains $112. The TRV shares traded down owing to the higher loss trend within commercial lines in the
quarter, which more than overshadowed the strong and improving rate within its commercial lines book,
in our view.
The Quarter In A Nutshell. This morning (7/23), TRV reported Q2 core loss of $0.20 per share, in
line with our estimate and its preannouncement. Recall that TRV had preannounced earnings on 7/14
and provided a wide range of Q2 earnings metrics, including the earnings loss per share it expected,
although it did not give underlying margins or the level of reserve development. TRV's results were ahead
of us in Personal lines (on stronger underlying results due to the frequency benefit from Covid-19), and
weaker in Bond & Specialty, with Business Insurance mostly in-line with our revised numbers, although
with an absence of favorable development. NPW declined by 1.4%, but were +2% excluding the premium
refund, better than our estimate for a 1.1% decline excluding the refund. TRV did not repurchase any
shares, in line with our estimate. TRV did update its NII outlook to be down $35-40 million on a quarterly
basis for the rest of 2020, from the prior $20 million decline, which is not surprising given the drop in
rates in Q1. Q3 should however see a rebound in alternative investments. Book value per share rose by
6.8% and the core ROE was (0.8%). Business Insurance renewal rate change was +7.4%, improving from
+6.1% in the Q1 and +4.8% in Q4, with rates up in all lines away from workers' comp and up in the
double-digits excluding workers' comp. We had expected about 100 bps of improvement in the renewal
rate. Exposure growth was -1.8% versus -1.0% in the Q1.

2020 Outlook Updated For Lower Investment Income
2020 Outlook Lowered For Investment Income. Exhibit 2 below highlights TRV's commentary and
expectations for 2020. TRV pulled its outlook in Q1 2020 for renewal premium change and its underlying
margins for the remainder of 2020 as a result of the uncertainty associated with the potential impacts
associated with Covid-19, but did provide an outlook for net investment income, and also provided helpful
color around other line items in the model. TRV's fixed net investment income should be down
approximately $35-40 million per quarter in H2 2020 and the company expects alts to improve in the Q3
given the market rebound, but did note that alts may not see the full benefit with Q3 earnings to reflect
continued economic uncertainty. For catastrophe losses, TRV highlighted that they have accumulated
$1.4 billion of qualified losses towards the aggregate retention of $1.55 billion on its property aggregate
cat XOL treaty. The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $280 million of $500 million of losses above the
$1.55 billion retention. TRV did not point to a specific level for share repurchases, but did not close the
door on potential share repurchases in Q3 or Q4. We get the sense that TRV will not repurchase shares in
Q3, but will likely repurchase a modest amount (we have $300 million) with Q4 earnings. When looking at
premium volume, TRV said that they expect to feel the effects on an earned basis beyond the end of the
year. In Business Insurance, the company is getting rate which could improve forward margins,
although they did highlight that they will likely see 50 bps increase in loss trend given the social inflation
and liability dynamics. In Bond and Specialty, TRV highlighted that the loss ratio could remain elevated
as a result of the recessionary environment. In Personal Insurance, we got the sense that frequency
trends will remain favorable with Q3 earnings, but TRV did noted that severity trends could partially offset
this benefit to underlying loss trends. Further, TRV said that the expense ratio could be elevated in the
near term as they do not expect to make significant adjustments to their fixed expense base in response
to short-term fluctuations in business volumes.

Pricing momentum building. The combination of weather-related losses, historically low interest rates,
higher loss trend in liability lines, the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic contraction have
Travelers comparing this market to the one after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. This supports our bullish
pricing view. Further, TRV pointed to being close to the trough of the workers' comp cycle (although did
not say when comp might turn). This bullish pricing is all a good data point, but is being counter-balanced
by the higher loss trend within their business insurance book. For TRV's underlying BI margins to improve
they would need to see rate continue at these levels, without a corresponding increase in loss trend.
Further, with Travelers not seeing as much Covid-19 losses as some peers and more immune from
reinsurance rate increases (as they have high retentions on their treaties) we do wonder if they can
continue to push for as much price (double-digits away from workers' comp).

Takeaways For The Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us and the laterals for the rest of the group include:
(1) Commercial lines pricing continues to firm and picked up in the Q2 with renewal rates up 7.4% in
business insurance and rates up in the double-digits away from workers comp. Further, TRV saw 2%
premium growth (excluding the impact of the personal auto premium refund) as the strong renewal
rate change more than offset the impact of lower exposures due to Covid-19. This is positive for
the commercial insurers (AIG, CB and HIG) and specifically AIG and CB where workers'
comp represent a smaller portion of their book.
(2) Higher loss trend in Business Insurance could prove to be TRV-specific. Over the past couple of years
Travelers has added to its lost trend in most cases due to the impact of social inflation (the last time
was a similar 50 basis point increase to 4.5% in Q2 2019) and since they did point to some reserve
increases for prior years for general liability and commercial multi-peril we are not surprised they
increased their loss trend as well. This quarter TRV upped their loss trend within Business Insurance
from 4.5% to 5% in commercial lines. We are not expecting a broad-based increase by other
commercial lines insurers. Our assumption is that the 50 basis point increase in loss trend
could provide to be TRV specific in the quarter.
(3) Business interruption should be insulated from Covid-19 claims. TRV once again highlighted that for
its commercial property book its policies require losses to be caused by a direct physical damage to
property for it to be a covered BI loss. Additionally, its standard policy form specifically excludes
losses or damages resulting from a virus. Further, a couple of court decisions so far in NY and
Michigan have both upheld the physical damage requirement to trigger BI claims for Covid-19.
Additionally within commercial lines, TRV is seeing fewer commercial auto and slip and fall type claims
and is also seeing the plaintiffs' bar move to settle claims faster. This is positive for all
commercial lines insurers, but the most positive for HIG under our coverage, as HIG has a
similar account footprint as TRV.
(4) Workers' comp impact from Covid-19 is manageable and level of losses are subsiding and not as bad
as feared. Generally workers' comp claims will be triggered if the employee can demonstrate that the
injury occurred over the course of employment, including healthcare workers and first responders
(not represent a significant part of TRV's book). TRV highlighted that some states have taken steps to
expand the scope of comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability, although given the
older age-range that seems to be more impacted by Covid-19 are not in the workforce. Further TRV
said that the frequency of comp claims stabilized in the Q2, which could be attributed to improved
supply of PPE and the healthcare workers having the benefit of more experience in dealing with
Covid-19 patients. The better results within workers' comp is a positive for HIG.
(5) Personal auto is benefiting from a lack of driving, although does seem like the best of this benefit
came in April. Confirming what we saw in PGR's numbers this quarter, Travelers benefited from a lack
of driving by its insurers with miles down significantly from pre Covid-19 levels and reaching a weekly
low point in April. TRV did caution that there could be an offset to the favorable frequency trends as
severity could rise as individuals get into accidents at higher speeds as well as distracted driving. This
is a positive lateral for the personal auto insurers (ALL and PGR) who should continue to
benefit from favorable frequency trends in auto (which is their largest business).
(6) NII from fixed income will be pressured for the group, although alternative NII should improve
significantly in the Q3. TRV lowered its outlook for NII from its fixed maturity investments, but did
point to non-fixed income results being stronger in the Q3 reflective of the lag in the portfolio and the
recovery in the equity markets in the Q2. TRV did however say that recoveries may not be reflected in
the private equity and hedge fund results as quickly as the downturns were as the fund managers
may take a more measured approach and not write-up the valuations as quickly as they wrote them
down. This would imply to all insurers (life and non-life) as everyone will be impacted by
lower interest rates, with a positive tailwind to alts in the Q3 due to the one-quarter lag.
(7) Repurchases could remain minimal for the group. Following not buying back any of its shares in the
Q2, TRV once again pointed to being more cautious when it comes to capital return, due to the impact
of both the ongoing economic uncertainty and the fact that we are now in hurricane season. We
expect all insurers, P&C and life, to remain cautious on the buyback front as they look to
conservative capital in these uncertain markets.

Covid-19 Thoughts
TRV's Q2 Covid-19 losses in line with preannounced levels. . When TRV preannounced Q2 earnings
results, the Covid-19 losses of $114 million were well below our $448 million estimate for the Q2 ($560
million total incl. Q3) and below our market share and industry loss estimates and somewhat surprising
given the elevated losses from others (see Exhibit 3). We are currently forecasting $112 million of Covid-
19 related losses in the Q3 (TRV did not give an indication of future losses and given the $50 million of
losses in H1 2020, which ignores only investment income, we believe our forward Covid-19 loss estimate
could prove to be conservative). TRV highlighted that a majority of the Q2 losses were workers comp
although the workers' comp impact from Covid-19 is manageable and level of losses are subsiding and not
as bad as feared. Additionally, TRV highlighted that for its commercial property book its policies require
losses to be caused by a direct physical damage to property for it to be a covered BI loss.

Highlights Of Our Estimate Changes
Equity Research
Overview of our estimate changes. Exhibit 4 highlights the changes we made to our earnings model
following Q2 2020 earnings. Our 2020 EPS estimate goes to $9.25 from $8.90, while our 2021 and 2022
estimates are unchanged at $9.95 and $10.60, respectively. The primary changes to our model includes:
(1) Weaker net investment income in H2 2020 to reflect TRV's guidance for a decline in fixed income
NII of $35-40 million in the Q3 and Q4. We are also lowering our NII estimates for 2021 and 2021.
We had previously assumed higher alternatives in the Q3 and made minor adjustment to our
assumption.
(2) Loss ratio adjustments all segments. We lowered our underling loss ratio estimates in Business
Insurance to reflect the strong pricing TRV is getting. We raised our underlying loss ratio in Bond and
Specialty in Q3 2020 to be in line with the Q2 2020 level to reflect elevated loss activity associated
with the economic slowdown. We lowered our underlying loss ratio in Personal Lines (mainly personal
auto) in the Q3 to reflect better frequency trends then we had previously been modeling (although we
do not expect the margin in the Q3 to be as strong as the Q2 as individuals start to return to work
and driving picks up).
(3) Lower favorable reserve development in subsequent quarters in Business Insurance following the
PYD miss in the Q2.
(4) We are now forecasting no repurchases in the Q3 versus our previous $200 million estimate. We
also lowered our Q4 buyback estimate to $300 million from $400 million.

Pricing Accelerating In Commercial Lines
Business Insurance Rating Environment -TRV Rates Picked Up As Expected, While Exposure
Declined
. In the Q2, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +7.4%, accelerating 130 bps from the
+6.1% in Q1 2020 and +4.8% in Q4 2019. Exposure growth was -1.8%, lower than the -1.0% in Q1
2020 (revised down from +1.6%) and the +0.2% in Q4 (revised down from +1.4%). See Exhibit 5
below, which shows the recent trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal
rate change.
·
TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC as the company is unsure of how the economy
will be impacted from Covid-19. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains negative
in the Q3.

Margins Mostly In Line With A Strong Underlying Beat In Personal Lines
Underlying Results Beat With Strong Results In Personal Lines
.
The consolidated combined ratio was 103.7%, missing our 103.4% estimate largely reflective less
favorable reserve releases. Cats of $854 million were in line with preannounced levels and favorable
reserve development of $2 million missed our $114 million estimate. The underlying combined ratio of
91.4% beat our 92.8% estimate, and improved 3.5 bps from last year. Underlying results beat us in
Personal Insurance, missed us in Bond and Specialty, and were in line with us in Business Insurance.
Catastrophe losses of $854 million were in line with preannounced levels and came from severe
storms in several regions of the United States as well as civil unrest.
·
·
Favorable development totaled only $2 million and fell short of our estimate for favorable
development of $114 million. There was no favorable development in Business Insurance versus our
estimate for favorable development of $85 million as releases in workers' comp and commercial
property were offset by adverse development in general liability and commercial multi-peril. Bond and
Specialty saw adverse development of $33 million versus our estimate for $20 million of favorable
development, while Personal Insurance saw $35 million of favorable development versus our estimate
for $9 million of favorable development.
·
TRV did not provide any forward guidance due to the potential impact of Covid-19 on its businesses,
but did note that all losses booked in the quarter were as of 6/30 and did not reflect an estimate for
subsequent losses. .

The Travelers Companies, Inc.
Equity Research
Investment Income And Other
Investment Income In Line With Preannounced Levels But Forward Outlook Lowered
·
Net investment income was $268 million pre-tax, in line with TRV's preannouncement. Travelers' pre-
tax book yield on its investment portfolio was 1.4%, below the 3.2% yield for Q1 2020 due to the loss
within the non-fixed income portfolio. Fixed income investments added $498 million pre-tax, while
alts were negative $234 million, Short-term investments added $13 million.
·
Given the low interest rate environment TRV lowered its outlook for investment income and is now
looking for income from fixed maturities to be down $35-40 million after-tax per quarter. This
compares to down $20 million after-tax per quarter with Q1 earnings and Q4 guidance for a decline of
$5-10 million). In the Q3, private equity income should see a benefit, although TRV did note that they
may not see the full benefit from the market rebound in the Q3 as portfolio managers may be
hesitant to mark portfolio up by its full value given the continued economic uncertainty.
Capital Management - Likely Muted In The Q3
.
TRV did not repurchases shares in the Q2, in line with our estimate. Dividends were $218 million
versus the $50 million loss in core earnings. We now removed repurchases in the Q3 versus our
previous $200 million estimate and we lowered our Q4 estimate to $300 million from $400 million.
Our 2020 capital return estimates have the company returning approximately 68% of its core
earnings while our 2021 and 2022 estimates are 98% and 96%, respectively.
Premium Growth Modestly Below Us
Net premiums fell 1.4% versus our -1.1% estimate and slowed from 4.1%% in Q1. The shortfall in
premiums was due to lower Business Insurance and Personal Insurance volume, which more than
offset premium growth within both Bond and Specialty. Gross premiums fell by 0.9%. Excluding the
premium refunds in Personal Insurance, TRV's net written premiums increased by 2%.
.
Business Insurance net premiums declined 2.5% versus our -1.9% estimate and 0.6% in the Q1. The
slowdown in Business Insurance premiums was due to the impact of economic disruption on insured
exposures.
. Bond and Specialty net premiums were up 3.4% versus our 1.9% estimate and 12.9% in the Q1. The
Q2 growth reflected strong growth in the company's management liability and international
businesses, partially offset by lower surety production.
. Personal Insurance net premiums fell by 1.1% versus our -0.6% estimate and 8.1% in the Q1.
Excluding the impact of premium refunds of $216 million, net written premiums grew by 6% in
Personal Insurance. Within personal insurance, TRV saw a decline of 12.2% in auto (below +2.9% in
Q1) due to the premium refund and growth of 12.8% in home (versus +18.3% in Q1).

Highlights From Our Loss Trend Analysis
Looking At TRV Loss Picks Versus Others. Exhibit 10 highlights the statutory general liability (Other
Liability - Claims Made) initial loss ratios and the total level of development for AIG, CB, HIG, TRV, and the
P&C industry for the 2019 accident year and how other prior years have developed (this data was just
available last month following the filing of company's annual statutory results). Exhibit 11 provides the
same data for Other Liability - Claims Made, Exhibit 12 for Commercial Auto, and Exhibit 13 for
commercial multi-peril. Given the lower loss ratios to start versus most peers we are not surprised to see
TRV once again adding to its loss trend within Business Insurance.

Equity Research
Price Target
Price Target: $112 from NC
Our price target of $112 is based on around a 0.95x multiple of our projected 2021 book value estimate of
around $109 and 11.3x our 2021 EPS estimate of $9.95. Risks to achieving our price target include large
catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs, and
a rise in D&O claims.
Investment Thesis
TRV has seen its loss picks within Business Insurance move higher primarily related to social inflation. We
think the shares could underperform peers moving forward if it does not hit its 2020 margin target and/or
if its reserve releases continue to slow down. In addition, TRV is less exposed to price increases due to its
higher workers' comp exposure and also lacks the exposure to large accounts which have seen the
strongest price increases. We rate the TRV shares Underweight.
Company Description
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV) is the second largest writer of commercial lines in the United States
and also the second-largest writer of personal insurance through independent agents. The company is

and surety products, as well as risk management services. Products are distributed primarily through
independent agents and brokers in all 50 states and in select international markets.
