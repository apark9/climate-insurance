Arch Capital
Healthy Overall Results
ACGL's results were healthy. We consider Arch a strong franchise but are
Neutral due to a cautious view of the reinsurance market and valuation.
. EPS below our forecast, but above consensus. ACGL announced
1Q22 operating EPS of $1.10, below our $1.18 projection but above
consensus of $1.06. The shortfall to our model was driven by investment
income and higher expenses. Underwriting income beat in the mortgage
insurance business, but missed in P&C reinsurance and insurance.
· Operating fundamentals were healthy. Overall margins were as
expected on a reported basis (combined ratio of 78.7%), but slightly
worse on a core basis (CR ex. cats and PYD of 80.8% vs. 80.3%E).
Margins were especially strong in mortgage insurance, but weak in P&C
insurance. The expense ratio in the insurance and reinsurance businesses
ticked up. Management attributed this to higher incentive comp and a
shift in business mix. The mix shift should benefit the loss ratio, while
incentive comp should decline in 2Q22. Cat losses were elevated as
well, but this was mostly due to Russia-related reserves, virtually all of
which relate to IBNR, suggesting that ACGL booked conservatively to
take advantage of healthy underlying business trends. Written premiums
rose 5.0%, above our 1.2% assumption. On the other hand, investment
income was below our expectation. ACGL spent $255 million on share
repurchases in 1Q22, higher than our $100 million assumption.
. Our outlook for business trends is mixed. In our view, the company's
results will be marked by healthy MI and re/insurance margins, strong
re/insurance premiums, and weak MI premiums. Also, we expect share
buybacks to slow from 2021 levels as ACGL focuses more on organic
growth, particularly in re/insurance. Longer term, we anticipate healthy
returns in the MI business, which generates the bulk of ACGL's
underwriting earnings. However, margins are likely to compress from
2022 levels given the commoditized nature of the business, black box
pricing, and higher capital requirements. Meanwhile, our long-term view
of the reinsurance market is cautious, and we expect excess capacity,
more 3rd party participation, increased mobility of capital, and broker
consolidation to preclude a sustained hard market.
· We maintain our Neutral rating. In our opinion, Arch is a top-tier
franchise, but in commoditized markets. Over time, ACGL has
transitioned into more of an MI firm than a P&C reinsurer. Our long-
term outlook for the MI business is upbeat, but we remain cautious on
the reinsurance market. Also, we feel that the stock's valuation is not too
enticing given the company's long-term ROE and growth profile.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premier franchise and expect it to
generate higher and less volatile underwriting margins than
most peers. However, we remain Neutral on the stock given a
cautious long-term outlook for the P&C reinsurance market. In
our view, near-term results in the MI and re/insurance
businesses will benefit from the economic recovery, a healthy
housing market, and firm re/insurance pricing. Meanwhile, our
long-term outlook is mixed as we expect MI returns to be held
back by commoditized nature of the product, black box
pricing, and higher capital requirements. Moreover, we remain
negative on the P&C reinsurance business, and forecast excess
capacity, greater third-party participation, increased mobility
of capital, and consolidation among brokers to preclude
sustained hard market.

We consider AGCL a premier franchise, but are Neutral on the stock given our
cautious long-term outlook for the reinsurance market. In our view, ACGL has
an industry-leading reinsurance business with a unique culture and approach to
underwriting that will generate superior and less volatile margins over time. Arch has
also established itself as one of the top competitors in the mortgage insurance (MI)
market, which we view as a structurally superior business to reinsurance. Plus,
ACGL has been driving premium growth and margin improvement in its primary
insurance business. In the near term, we expect ACGL's MI results to benefit from
healthy housing and labor market conditions, and P&C margins to benefit from firm
pricing. On a negative note, ACGL could incur losses in aviation and political risk
coverages due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, our long-term outlook for
the reinsurance business remains cautious given structural headwinds in the market
(e.g. excess capital, low barriers to entry, limited pricing power, etc.). Lastly, top-line
growth in the MI business is likely to slow as higher interest rates weigh on mortgage
originations. Lastly, the stock's valuation does not seem compelling given the
company's long-term ROE and growth potential.
Mortgage Insurance: Strong Margins, but Weak Growth
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance primarily through acquisitions (CMG in
2014 and United Guaranty in 2016) during a time when market conditions were
favorable overall, marked by appreciating home prices, relatively stringent lending
standards at mortgage issuers, and disciplined pricing by mortgage insurers. Since
these acquisitions, Arch's MI business has generated healthy margins. Despite the
temporary setback from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, reserve releases have
been a tailwind (and are likely to remain as such through 2022) as loans delinquent
early during the pandemic have become current on payments. On a cautious note, we
expect higher interest rates to suppress mortgage origination volumes, and although
not imminent, a recession could result in higher defaults and weaker MI margins.
P&C Reinsurance: Long-Term Outlook Remains Negative
We expect ACGL's reinsurance margins to be better and less volatile than
peers', but our long-term outlook for the market remains cautious. Arch has
historically produced stronger results than most other reinsurers, which we attribute
to its focus on specialty reinsurance (where pricing tends to be less competitive),
conservative underwriting philosophy, ability to shift target segments based on
changing market conditions, and judicious management of cat risk. In particular,
ACGL prices business using the risk-free rate (naturally leading to more conservative
underwriting) and deploys a long-term compensation framework for underwriters
that pays based on underwriting margins over a multi-year period. Also, the creation
of 3rd party capital vehicles such as Premia Re has allowed Arch to earn fee income
from its reinsurance franchise. While we consider Arch a top-tier reinsurer, our long-
term outlook for the reinsurance market is negative due to several structural
headwinds, including the commoditized nature of the product and the ease of entry of
new capital. Pricing remains firm overall, but we expect the pace of price hikes to
moderate over the next year, which could weigh on top-line growth and margins.
Moreover, we believe that catastrophe risk has been systemically underpriced as
prices have not kept up with increasing frequency and severity.

1Q22 Details
This evening, Arch reported first quarter 2022 operating EPS of $1.10, lower than
our $1.18 projection but above consensus of $1.06. Compared with our model,
underwriting income beat in the mortgage insurance business, but missed in P&C
reinsurance and insurance. Investment income and other income (primarily earnings
from affiliates including Somers/Watford and Coface and corporate expenses) were
weaker than assumed as well.

On a total company basis, underwriting margins were in-line with our forecast,
while investment income was weaker. The combined ratio was 78.7% on a reported
basis (as expected) and 80.8% excluding cat losses and prior year development
(slightly worse than our 80.3% forecast). Margins were especially strong in the
mortgage insurance business, but weak in insurance. The expense ratio in the
insurance and reinsurance businesses ticked up, which management attributed to
higher incentive comp and a shift in business mix. Net written premiums increased
5.0% to $2.6 billion, exceeding our $2.5 billion (+1.2%) assumption. On the other
hand, investment income was below our expectation. ACGL spent $255 million on
share repurchases in 1Q22, significantly above our $100 million assumption.

Mortgage Ins .: Strong Margins Offset Lower Premiums
MI results were marked by a shortfall in premiums but strong margins, and our
outlook remains upbeat given favorable housing and labor market trends. The
MI division generated underwriting income of $285 million in 1Q22, well above our
$254 million estimate, with upside in margins (CR of 3.2% versus our 23.0%
estimate) more than offsetting lower net earned premiums (-13.9% vs. - 3.8%E).
Margins benefited from favorable development on COVID-related reserves
established in 2020 (-36.5% vs. - 15.5%E), which more than compensated for a
slightly worse core combined ratio (39.7% vs. 38.5%E). Net written premiums
declined 14.0% to $288 million, close to our expectation, due to lower gross written
premiums. Management attributed the decline to lower mortgage volumes in the
U.S., offset by growth in Australia.
Through 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were pressured by artificially high
delinquencies attributable to homeowners availing themselves of government
forbearance programs. However, with forbearance programs having expired, more
loans are curing, particularly those where borrowers were taking advantage of
forbearance programs but were not in financial stress. The significant appreciation in
house prices is driving lower delinquencies as well. The number of delinquent loans
has declined steadily since spiking in 2Q20 and, barring an economic recession, we
expect the trend to continue. The percent of loans in default in the U.S. primary MI
business was 2.1% at 3/31/22, an improvement from 2.4% at 12/31/21, 2.7% at
9/30/2021, and 3.9% at 3/31/2021.

We project MI margins to remain robust. U.S. accounting rules require Arch to
set reserves for the primary U.S. MI business based on reported delinquencies (unlike
for P&C lines, an IBNR component is not permitted under U.S. GAAP for primary
MI business). Despite a strong housing market and improved labor market
conditions, delinquencies rose after the onset of the pandemic and Arch, like its
mortgage insurance peers, had to establish corresponding reserves. However, we
believe that a meaningful portion of delinquencies resulted from homeowners' taking
advantage of the government's forbearance protection programs (mainly to preserve
liquidity), not the result of actual financial hardship. As such, actual losses on most
delinquent loans being reported to MI companies should be very low, and we
anticipate a high level of cures with the expiration of forbearance programs (initially
set for 12/31/20, but then extended through 9/30/21 and, in some cases, year-end
2021 or beyond). The interplay of cures on previously delinquent loans and how new
delinquencies emerge in response to the economic environment will be the key driver
of MI margins through 2022. We believe that the strong labor and housing markets,
coupled with cures on previously delinquent loans, will drive robust margins in the
business over the next few quarters. The strong housing market, and the ensuing
equity cushion accumulated by homeowners, is contributing to reserve releases, a
phenomenon that is likely to continue in the near future. On a cautious note, top-line
growth in the business is likely to be sluggish given lower mortgage originations
following the increase in interest rates.
ACGL has become a formidable competitor in the mortgage insurance market
through acquisitions, and could expand further via M&A in the future. ACGL
entered the mortgage re/insurance business in 2011, but was only marginally
involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit
unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The
company's 2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it
a bigger foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to
A- at S&P) and gained distribution into the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch

became a top 10 competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market
position strengthened further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty
(UGC) from AIG, which catapulted the company to a top-3 competitor (as part of the
deal, AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance blocks originated by UGC prior to
2017). The company has also expanded its presence in foreign MI markets through
M&A, including its recent acquisition of Westpac's mortgage insurance business in
Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Lower Margins Drove Miss, Growth Robust
The insurance business reported strong premium growth, but lower than
expected margins. Underwriting income in 1Q22 was $63 million, below our
$82 million assumption, driven by a higher than assumed combined ratio (93.8%
versus our 92.3% estimate). The loss ratio was better than assumed (58.5% vs.
60.3%E) despite high cat losses and reserves for the Russia/Ukraine war (3.1% vs.
2.0%E). However, this was more than offset by a higher acquisition and operating
costs (expense ratio of 35.3% vs. 32.0%E). Management attributed the increase in the
expense ratio partly to higher incentive comp and in part to a business mix shift to
lines such as travel and professional liability that have higher expense ratios but
lower loss ratios, and profit commissions. The company expects incentive comp to
moderate in 2Q22, implying an improvement in the expense ratio. Underwriting
results were slightly worse than expected on a core basis as well (CR ex. cats and
PYD of 90.8% versus our 90.5% estimate). Meanwhile, top-line growth was robust,
with premiums rising 21.3% to $1.2 billion versus our 16.2% estimate, which
management attributed to firm pricing.

ACGL has attractive opportunities in insurance, and our outlook for premium
growth and margins is constructive. After shrinking its "cycle managed" business
(now dubbed as wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to 2017, ACGL is seeing
healthy growth in this portion of the book, driven by price increases in the broader
market, particularly in E&S. This, coupled with consistent performance in the less
opportunistic parts of its book (specialty small/middle market and franchise) and the
healthy economy (which should benefit exposure units in most lines, but especially
travel), should drive healthy results in the business. On a cautious note, we believe
that the market is past the midpoint of the current pricing cycle. As such, although
the favorable tailwinds being experienced by the insurance business should persist as
premiums are earned, we expect the pace of price increases on new business to
moderate through 2022 and 2023.
Reinsurance: High Expenses Drove Miss; Outlook Downbeat
Reinsurance results were marked by healthy premium growth, but lower than
expected earnings. Underwriting income in 1Q22 was $109 million, below our
$148 million estimate, due to an elevated combined ratio (86.6% vs. 83.0%E).
Similar to the insurance business, the shortfall in underwriting margins was mainly
driven by elevated acquisition and operating costs, which ACGL attributed to higher
incentive comp as well as a shift in business mix, profit commissions, and seasonal
expense items. Claims were in-line with a lower AY loss ratio (52.6% vs. 57.0%E)
mostly offset by higher catastrophe claims, which included losses related to
Russia/Ukraine in lines such as marine cargo, political violence, and aviation.
Management disclosed that to date there have been no filed Russia/Ukraine claims,
and that virtually all Russia/Ukraine losses booked by ACGL in 1Q22 (for both
insurance and reinsurance businesses) are related to IBNR. Core margins were better
(CR ex. cats and PYD of 82.7% vs. 83.5%E). Net written premium growth was
healthy, up 14.0% to $1.1 billion, higher than our 9.3% expectation.

J.P.Morgan
Our long-term outlook for the reinsurance market is cautious, but we expect
Arch Re to generate superior results compared to peers. ACGL's reinsurance
business was initially established to take advantage of the hard market for casualty
risk in the early 2000s. Over the years, however, management has shifted Arch Re's
business mix away from casualty coverage towards other specialty lines such as
surety, accident and health, agriculture, and trade credit, which are generally less
competitive and present more attractive risk-reward. We were previously concerned
about an uptick in losses related to COVID, especially for business interruption, but
court developments thus far have favored the re/insurers over claimants. Firming
pricing has benefited recent results as well, and should drive continued strong
premiums and margins in the near term. Still, we expect the pace of price hikes to
moderate and remain skeptical of a sustained hard market given the industry's
significant excess capacity and additional capital entering the market. Factors that
contributed to a multi-year soft market prior to 2019 (glut of capital, greater
fluidity/speed of capital, more providers of capacity, broker consolidation) are still
prevalent, and should preclude a prolonged hard reinsurance market. On a positive
note, results in the next 1-2 years could benefit from the release of COVID-related
business interruption reserves given favorable court decisions in most cases thus far.
Raising EPS Estimates
We are raising our 2Q22 EPS from $1.07 to $1.10, our 2022 forecast from $4.21 to
$4.22, and our 2023 EPS from $4.53 to $4.65. Our updated model reflects higher
than assumed share buybacks in 1Q22 (and an ensuing lower share count for future
periods) as well as modest revisions in our margin and premium assumptions. In our
view, catastrophe losses and trends in the housing market (which would affect
reserve releases) will be the main sources of variance between reported results and
our projections. A prolonged Russia/Ukraine war could drive additional losses as
well, but ACGL's current reserves seem conservative based on events thus far.
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Arch Capital Group Ltd. (Neutral; Price Target: $52.00)
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premiere franchise, but remain Neutral given our cautious
outlook for the reinsurance market and the stock's valuation. In our view, ACGL has
an industry-leading reinsurance business that we expect will deliver superior and less
volatile underwriting margins over time due to its unique culture and approach to the
market. In addition, Arch has established itself as one of the top competitors in the
mortgage insurance (MI) market, which we view as a structurally superior business
to P&C reinsurance. Also, ACGL has been able to grow premiums and improve
margins in its insurance business, helped by the hard P&C market. In the near term,
we expect results in the MI business to benefit from the healthy housing and labor
markets. Furthermore, firm P&C pricing should drive top-line growth and margins in
both the insurance and reinsurance segments. Longer term, however, we are cautious
on the reinsurance business due to structural concerns (including the market's excess
capital, low barriers to entry, limited pricing power, etc.). Moreover, we believe that
the stock's valuation is not compelling relative to the company's long-term ROE and
EPS growth potential.

Valuation
We are raising our December 2022 price target from $51 to $52 to reflect higher
EPS and book value estimates. Our price target assumes a 1.4x multiple on our
12/31/22E BV ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.4x multiple on our 12/31/22E BV forecast and
an 11.0x multiple on our 2023 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach with a
sum-of-the-parts analysis that values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from
mortgage insurance. Our target multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix,
which has become more skewed to mortgage insurance in recent years. Although
mortgage insurance continues to generate higher returns than re/insurance, especially
on legacy business from 2009 to 2016, we believe that an uptick in competition in
the mortgage insurance market is weighing on multiples for MI stocks. ACGL trades
at 1.5x BV and 11.4x 2022E EPS compared to 1.2x and 9.7x for the reinsurance
sector, 1.0x and 7.0x for mortgage insurance peers, and 1.4x and 12.7x for the
broader P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· The pricing environment continues to improve. Pricing in several lines of
business (reinsurance, specialty, casualty) has been favorable for several years
running. Sustained improvement could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift
sentiment on the stock.
· Management is able to maintain and/or improve insurance underwriting
margins. In our view, investor sentiment will improve if ACGL is able to sustain
an insurance combined ratio in the low to mid-90s even as the benefit of the hard
market recedes.
· Management remains proactive with share repurchases. ACGL has deployed
more capital towards buybacks than our assumptions in recent quarters. A
continuation of the trend could drive upward revisions in EPS forecasts and boost
sentiment on the stock.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's growing exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment or higher mortgage defaults would pressure the company's results
and hurt sentiment on the stock.
. Price increases in the reinsurance market slow. Although primary and
reinsurance pricing has been improving since 2018, we do not anticipate
sustained hardening. A reversal in pricing trends could drive downside risk in
EPS estimates as well as dampen sentiment on the sector.
· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development
has been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in
the pace of development could pressure margins and returns.
· Cat losses stay elevated. While prices for cat re/insurance have hardened, the
frequency and severity of catastrophe losses has increased by a larger magnitude
over time. This implies that reinsurance prices need to increase significantly for
underwriters to earn adequate returns, especially in a scenario where cat losses
approximate those in the 2018-2020 period.

J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the
average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's)
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of
the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected
total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it
does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
