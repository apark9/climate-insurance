1Q23 Review: Remediation Plans
Ramping Up
ALL is taking more urgent actions to improve auto profitability
and capital adequacy by dropping its 3Q target for buyback
completion, pausing advertising spend, and pushing harder in
California in its rate filing process.

Incremental views on ALL post 1Q earnings.
The $649mn remaining under ALL's buyback program will not be completed by 3Q23. ALL's
10Q dropped this timeline reference and we confirmed our understanding with IR. We
previously expected that ALL would have taken a breather in 4Q23 from buybacks, but we are
now modeling a more leveled amount of buybacks a quarter this year, building off the amount
ALL completed in 1Q23 of ~$150mn.
California rate requests ramping up. ALL is now going to make an incremental auto filing
request for Allstate brand >6.9% in California. This is after Allstate brand received a second 6.9%
approval in CA, though that achievement was behind its indicated rate need of 17.3%. Likewise
its second 6.9% rate approval does not solve more quarters of bad loss data in the state that
continues to escalate. ALL is in active dialogue with the California Department of Insurance,
which appears to be a touch more open to take into account loss experience and had
encouraged ALL to request a higher rate request than the limit under Proposition 103.

Previously ALL took a bifurcated approach in California where its National General (NatGen)
company had success in the state achieving a 19.5% rate approval while at the time the Allstate
brand stuck to the maximum 6.9% allowance under Prop 103. We understand the motivation to
push for 19.5% in CA for NatGen was more operational, catching up for integrating Encompass
and NatGen.

Taking seasonality into account, we do not think ALL's AYLR for auto improved
sequentially. Between 2017-2019, ALL's underlying loss ratio was 2.5-4.5pts better in 1Q vs 4Q.
Therefore, ALL's reported 82.1% AYLR for auto that had a seasonality benefit is likely not an
improvement from 82.5%, which is the more clean 4Q22 auto underlying loss ratio, removing
the effects of prior quarter re-estimates. During 2022, ALL made several re-estimates to its prior
quarter auto underlying loss ratio, obscuring what the true metric in the corresponding
reporting period should look like. In Figure 2, we outline ALL's auto underlying loss ratio
adjusted for these inter-quarter estimates to better depict its quarterly trend.

. Auto underlying loss ratio ratio, previously we only saw auto AYLR for Protection
· Annualized average earned premium per PIF
· Average underlying loss (incurred pure premium) per PIF
. There is a bit of math involved, but we can take these new disclosures and come up with a
10.7% underlying loss trend for Allstate brand auto, predominantly due to severity, though
we do not have enough data to repeat this exercise for prior periods to make comparisons.
This is a new figure we will be tracking.
What is new for Auto Protection:
· Protection auto underlying loss hurt its AYLR by 6.5 pts, behind 5.7 pts of earned rate. This
6.5% underlying loss is for Protection so NatGen is included. It is also below Allstate Brand's
10.7% underlying loss trend since ALL applies a loss ratio (~80%) to loss trend. Therefore, its
loss ratio truncates the amount of pricing needed to achieve rate adequacy.
What is retired - we would have liked ALL to keep sharing:
· Loss trend by coverages. Lack of disclosures for finer cuts like auto physical damage
severity, bodily injury severity, and frequency.
Florida: ALL did not see a flurry of FL auto claims before reform had passed, unlike PGR. Just
because the timing of lawsuits came in earlier does not mean ALL would not have eventually
seen these claims and it feels like it had been accounting for in its ultimate reserve
assumptions.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
ALL's fundamentals are strong and
we look forward to seeing progress
on its transformative growth plan.
However, pricing correction actions
may stall ALL's progress in
actualizing stronger PIF growth.
Upside case
USD 130.00
Loss cost trends abate, returning to
2019 baseline levels. Successful
execution of Allstate's
transformational growth plans via
efficiency gains that is translated to
strong PIF growth, particularly in
auto. Our upside case of $130
assumes ~1.9x our '24 BVPS ex AOCI
estimate.
Downside case
USD 110.00
Steeper acceleration of loss cost
trends, particularly on the severity
side. Prolonged period of achieving
approvals from regulators with
respect to requested rate increases.
Our downside case of $110 assumes
~10x our '24 EPS estimates.

PF capital if ALL does not earn a statutory profit
this year
We are evaluating upcoming debt redemptions that ALL had previously announced it would
complete this year that would reduce its holding company's liquidity. We are assuming ALL
resumes taking dividends out of the operating companies in 2Q23. In this downside scenario
considering nil statutory earnings during the balance of the year, statutory surplus would
decrease to $14bn at YE22 from $15bn at 1Q23. Likewise, holding company liquidity would
decrease to $2.5bn in 4Q23 from $4.2bn in 1Q23.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

*This is the closing price referenced in the publication, which may not be
the last available closing price at the time of publication.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within
the next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or
an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $122 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended 11.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.78x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.
