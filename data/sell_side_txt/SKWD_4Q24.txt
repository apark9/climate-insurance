Skyward Specialty Insurance Group, Inc.
EPS in-line with Pre-release,
Programs, Captives, and Surety
Continue to Produce Strong
Growth
Numbers come in-line with what was pre-released three
weeks ago. Skyward saw strong double-digit plus growth in a
majority of product lines.
Skyward pre-released 4Q24 earnings three weeks ago, and the reported earnings today were in-
line with the pre-released results. New information provided in today's release was mainly the
product line growth breakdown. Skyward saw strong year-over-year growth across a majority of
their product lines, which led to GWP growth of 20.8%. As for specific product lines, Global
Property & Agriculture grew 21.9% vs. our 8% estimate, Programs saw 46.1% growth vs. our 14%
estimate, Captives saw 43.1% growth vs. our 35% estimate, and Surety saw 45.9% growth vs.
our 35% estimate. The only material miss in growth compared to our estimate was in
Transactional E&S, which saw growth of 20.2%, below our 40% expectation. Industry Solutions,
Accident & Health, and Professional Lines all came in a touch better or in-line with our
estimates. Overall, we view this as a really strong quarter and year in GWP growth and
believe Skyward will look to build on this momentum heading into 2025 and leverage their new
units which include Media Liability, Life Sciences, Mortgage and Credit, and Renewable Energy.
Guidance: Skyward's 2025 outlook was also pre-released and did not change. It called for
expected net income between $138-$150 million, a combined ratio between 91-92%, which
reflects 2 to 2.5 points of catastrophe losses, and GWP growth of low to mid-teens. Skyward also
disclosed that it expects total losses and LAE to be less than $10 million from the CA wildfire
event, net of reinsurance in 1Q25.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
Our Equal Weight rating reflects
optimism around the company's
strategy of building an economic
moat as a strong underwriter in
under served or niche markets.
However, we think there is some
risk around commercial auto and
other areas pressured by social
inflation causing some modest near
to medium term disruption in
growth and margins.
Upside case
USD 66.00
Our upside case assumes ROE
expectations increase by 50bps to
14.7% from improved loss ratios
and the premium to the regression
line increases to 65%.
Downside case
USD 40.00
Our downside case reflects a similar
methodology as our price target,
but assumes ROE expectations
decrease by 50 bps to 13.7% and
the premium to the regression line
remains consistent with current
levels at 25%.

Model Updates: A majority of our model updates were made following the pre-release,
however, we made slight adjustments to some of our product line growth assumptions
following the full release today. This led to a slight upward inflection in our 2025E/2027E
adjusted operating EPS estimates from $3.43/$4.43 to $3.46/$4.45, respectively. Our 2026E
adjust operating EPS estimate remains $3.96 and our price target remains $53.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Barclays | Skyward Specialty Insurance Group, Inc.
L: Skyward Specialty Insurance Group, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $53 reflects a 1.9x P/BVPS xAOCI multiple on our 3Q25E BVPS xAOCI, which was calculated from a P/BV vs
ROE regression based on our NT+1 (FQ5-8) ROE estimate of 14.2% and assuming SKWD trades at a 55% premium to the regression line.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside Risks: We think there is a chance the
company's multiple may trade at a premium if management is able to deliver consistent combined ratios through continued mix shift of its portfolio
into products that are less sensitive to the P&C cycle. Downside Risks: Decline in E&S demand as admitted carriers begin to underwrite risks
previously passed can thwart the growth trajectory of key business segments. Furthermore, a general slowdown in macro environment may lead to
lower coverage gaps as insured retain more risk to save on expenses.

Russia: This material is not intended for investors who are not Qualified Investors according to the laws of the Russian Federation as it might contain
information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by
Barclays or a third party ("Information"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration
is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes ("ESG Regimes"), unless
otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers
or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification,
label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are
reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
