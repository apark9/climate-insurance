Post 2Q24 Follow Up: Raising EPS and Price Target,
Neutral
We are raising our EPS estimates and price target for KNSL, from $420 to
$425. Our Neutral rating is unchanged. Kinsale reported 2Q24 earnings on
7/25/2024 and hosted a conference call the following day, on 7/26/2024.
· Raising EPS estimates. We are increasing EPS to reflect the earn through of
higher net written premium in 2Q24 as well as slightly higher net investment
income, trended off 2Q24 (3Q24 from $3.84 to $3.97, 2024 from $15.23 to
$15.77, 2025 from $18.77 to $19.04). We did not change our combined ratio
assumptions. Gross premiums in 2Q24 were roughly in-line, but retention
(which affects net written and net earned premiums) was better. Consistent
with past practice, we plan to arrive at a more refined review of 3Q24 gross
written premiums towards the end of September using reporting from state
stamping offices and 2Q24 statutory premium data, which gives a breakdown
between casualty and property business.
· 2Q24 attritional loss ratio better than expected, but we are not changing
our prospective margin assumptions. Recall that KNSL's 1Q24 loss ratio
surprised to the downside because of higher loss picks on casualty business
(which will remain the same in the short to medium term but could change
longer term depending on how pricing and loss trends develop). In 2Q24, the
loss ratio surprised to the upside because of "actual losses being below
expectations," likely due to short-tail/property business. Although short tail/
property business will naturally bring down KNSL's overall loss ratio
(property is priced to lower loss ratios than casualty), this should have been in
the 1Q24 result already and thus we attribute the 2Q24 result to natural
variability in property business, in this case favorable. For 3Q24 and 4Q24, we
are still expecting the same seasonality that Kinsale has exhibited in past years
where some of the conservatism in initial loss picks for the year is unwound in
2H. Therefore, for 2024, we are expecting a step down in the attritional loss
ratio from 59.8% in 1H24 to 56.0% in 2H24.
. 2Q24 summary. 2Q24 operating EPS was $3.75, above our $3.51 estimate and
consensus of $3.54. A slightly elevated tax rate (20.1% vs. 19.0%E) was a
$0.05 headwind to reported EPS, and thus our estimate of core operating EPS
is $3.80. Underwriting income was better than our model (+$0.21 per share
after taxes), with lower attritional claims (+$0.30), higher favorable
development (+$0.03), and slightly higher earned premiums (+$0.01) more
than offsetting higher catastrophe losses (-$0.08) and expenses (-$0.05). Net
investment was favorable as well (+$0.01 per share after tax). Gross premium
growth was modestly higher, net earned premiums were in-line.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly

insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts.
Our long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large
addressable market, superior technology platform, and low cost
base, which we view as a sustainable competitive advantage.
Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are
concerned about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C

Investment Thesis
KNSL held its earnings conference call on
July 26, 2024. The call replay is available
on https://ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We remain Neutral. Overall, we expect KNSL's premiums and margins to benefit from
favorable trends in the E&S market, which continues to generate healthy growth at
attractive pricing/terms even after several years of above-trend growth. Despite more
stable conditions in 2024 (i.e. less of a positive delta than in 2023), the property market
remains compelling and KNSL intends to grow the relative size of this business (~30%
of premiums in 2023) while controlling its exposure to property catastrophe risk. In the
meantime, casualty pricing could experience another uptick as more insurers recognize
adverse development. Independent of the market environment, we think that Kinsale's
low-cost operating model is a sustainable competitive advantage, especially against
higher cost insurers like Lloyd's writers. During periods of softer pricing, KNSL's lower
expense ratio will allow it to be more competitive on pricing while still generating
above-average growth and margins. We remain Neutral on the stock, however, as we
think its valuation is full compared to commercial peers and specialist names even after
giving credit to KNSL's growth potential and above-average margins. Further, while
favorable P&C market conditions are likely to persist through 2024 and will have
positive implications for KNSL's reserves and future earnings, the eventual turn in the
P&C pricing cycle is a downside risk to the stock's above-average multiple. Less
favorable development on older accident years could also decrease the quantum of
reserve releases in future quarters. Having said this, if KNSL's near-term growth
trajectory comes in better, we could become more constructive on the stock.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
In our view, the E&S market - where KNSL operates exclusively - will eventually see
moderating new business volumes and price hikes as more underwriters focus on growth
(a negative for pricing) and admitted markets increase their appetite for risk (recapturing
business from E&S). We also expect retail brokers to eventually divert business back to
admitted markets to recapture the economics they are sharing with wholesalers. Still,
our view is that KNSL can continue to grow premiums at a healthy pace given its small
base and the fragmented pricing cycle whereby certain lines are seeing pricing
deceleration (property excluding high value homeowners') and others could potentially
see another upward inflection (casualty). With respect to profitability, our view is that
the combination of price hikes and conservative reserving will support healthy margins
at KNSL for the foreseeable future. However, we think that reserve releases will
diminish in the near term given that more mature accident years (2015-2019) are likely
to have less redundancy than before, and that more recent accident years (2020 and
onwards) - where presumably embedded margins are thicker - are still un-seasoned.
Low Cost Base a Sustainable Competitive Advantage
KNSL has a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform built from ground up -
in contrast to peers that use unwieldy systems built off legacy and newer technologies -
which allows it to handle significant business volumes without sacrificing customer
responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense efficiency. As a result, KNSL
maintains an industry leading expense ratio, and we expect it to outperform higher cost
competitors through the pricing cycle. During softer markets, KNSL can grow
premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-average profitability, and in hard
markets, Kinsale can be a price taker and generate excess returns.

KNSL is in the process of updating its technology platform towards a "target state" with
more modular architecture and where insured data can be accessed across multiple
applications simultaneously. Management expects these upgrades to deliver cost
efficiencies, incremental revenues, and analytical capabilities. The amount of funding
for this initiative was not sized by Kinsale, but management noted that it should be fully
absorbed in the current run-rate expense ratio.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle Is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect price hikes to
eventually moderate as re/insurers re-position themselves for growth. Given this, we see
multiple compression as a risk since pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in
E&S because of its function as a safety valve for the market. Although we think some
portion of E&S share gains is permanent and that KNSL will thrive even if prices
soften, a reasonable valuation analysis will have to look several years out because of
KNSL's above-average growth profile and would thus have to account for conditions in
the market at that time.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale (Neutral; Price Target: $426.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our
long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior
technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2025 from $420 to $426 given our higher EPS and BV
estimates. Our price target assumes a 4x multiple on 2026E BV and an 18x multiple on
2026E operating income. These target multiples are well above peers', which we think is
supported by KNSL's above-average premium growth (mid-teens growth versus mid- to
high-single-digit growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile (high 70s to
low 80s CR versus 85-90% for peers). KNSL trades at 8.5x BV, well above specialty peers
(ex. PLMR) of 2.5x and commercial peers at 1.8x. On 2024E earnings, KNSL trades at 29x
versus 14x for specialty insurers (ex. PLMR) and 12x for commercial insurers.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
. The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher prices and
greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If current conditions
persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our forecasts and investor
sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We would
expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds growth
expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving suggests margin
improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin improvement tracks higher than
expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push-back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market, and clients are
pushing back more strongly on price hikes, while more insurers are deploying capital
and positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to turn, there is a risk of
multiple compression for insurers that have seen an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation reemerge in casualty reserves. Although
unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and low limits, the
reopening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up liability claims.
· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has a
strong underwriting track record, and it is entering new lines in a strong part of the cycle.

J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
Coverage Universe: Singzon, Pablo S: Bowhead (BOW), Fidelis Insurance (FIHL), Goosehead (GSHD), Hagerty (HGTY), Kinsale (KNSL),
Palomar (PLMR), The Baldwin Group (BWIN)
