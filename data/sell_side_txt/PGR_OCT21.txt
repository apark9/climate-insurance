Oct '21: More Pain Before Gain
Stock Rating
UNDERWEIGHT
Unchanged
We anticipate more pain before gain. Clearly PGR is in repair mode with a reported
underlying loss ratio of 80.2% and combined ratio of 97.2% once again north of its 96%
target. During 3Q21, PGR increased rates by about 6% for half of the country, and
recognized 3% in that period. PGR is filing for more rate increases. Looking at October
effective dates, PGR received 13 approvals amongst 10 states ranging from - 1% to 7.1%
(Figure ). PGR currently has 32 pending requests for rate changes across 12 states. States
we are watching closely are TX (10 pending rate increases ranging from 0%-8.4%) and
FL (4 pending rate increases; magnitude not disclosed). We think it could take 12-18
months for auto insurance pricing to be rational, even though most policies are 6 months.
The longer it takes regulators to get on board with rate filing requests, the more time
insurers will see accumulation of lost trend that they are not appropriately pricing. We
see severity as transitory "for longer", with used car sale prices not rebasing to pre-
pandemic levels.
Oct operating EPS of $0.23 beat our $0.20 estimate primarily on pre-tax cats (0 pts,
$0mn), which was ~1.3 pts better than expected, favorable reserve development
($57mn, 1.3 pts vs. our estimate of 0.5 pts of adverse development) and an expense ratio
beat (~110 bps lower than our estimate). These areas offset PGR's underlying loss ratio
of 80.2% (Figure 1), which was worse than our 76.6% estimate.

PIF growth headwinds stiffening: PGR's total personal auto PIF y/y growth (+7.1% vs.
our estimate of +8.3%) again fell short of our estimate across both auto direct (+8.9% vs.
our +9.5%) and auto agency (+5.0% vs. +7.0%). See Figure 2 for monthly detail.
Management actions are needed for PGR to meet its long-term target CR of 96%.
We reduce our price target to $81 (from $82) and reiterate our Underweight rating.
Our $81 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.7x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2022/2023. '22E and '23E
EPS is $4.09 (vs. $4.24 prior) and $5.45 (vs. $5.49 prior), respectively. '22E and '23E BVPS
(ex AOCI) is $30.38 (vs. $30.36 prior) and $32.96 (vs. $32.98 prior), respectively.

Price Target
USD 81.00
Why Underweight? Our call on PGR takes a longer
term view. PGR may need to hold more capital to
support an evolving business mix, which could lower
ROEs. We see PGR's business expansion beyond core
personal auto focus to be more defensive vs.
offensive. PGR's excess growth in commercial auto
runs against the industry grain and expands risk
appetite to riskier auto classes.

Upside case
USD 102.00
If PGR is able to leverage its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines, it could achieve
the same measurable success as its core personal
auto book. Upside case reflects ~25x '22E EPS and
~19x '23E EPS.

Downside case
USD 75.00
We think margins peak in 2020 and are not reflective
of longer term trends. Auto pricing reflects artificially
low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic.
Downside case reflects ~18x '22E EPS and ~ 14x '23E
EPS.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative
(see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully
read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $81 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.7x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2022/2023.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR were
to meet its 96% combined ratio objective in newer business lines driving the recent expansion of its core business profile by leveraging its
multivariate pricing model. In addition, we think margins are peaking in 2020 due to environmental factors and not reflective of longer-term trends
but if PGR is able to avoid margin pressure over the long term it could maintain a stronger earnings growth profile than anticipated. While auto
pricing currently reflects artificially low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic, a reversion to more normal pricing points should prove difficult
to achieve. However, normalization of pricing could drive better performance in personal auto.

Law) only. Barclays Israeli branch previously held an investment marketing license with the Israel Securities Authority but it cancelled such license
