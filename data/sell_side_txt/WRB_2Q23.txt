WRB: Lower Cats Drives EPS Beat at Berkley; Q2 and Conference Call Roundup
Our Call
WRB reported Q2 EPS of $1.14, beating our $1.10 and consensus of $1.08 as lower
cat losses, more than offset a weaker underlying margin than we had expected. Growth
picked up in the quarter to 9% (from 7%) and WRB pointed to stronger momentum in H2.
Estimate and price target changes: We are slightly raising our 2023 EPS estimate to
$4.75 (from $4.74) as the Q2 upside is counter-balanced by a lower margin, while our
2024 estimate goes to $5.95 from $6.05 and our 2025 EPS estimate falls to $6.80 (from
$7.00). Our forward numbers reflect higher underlying combined ratio counter-balanced
by higher investment income (current yields remain a good amount above the book yield).
Our price target goes to $75 (from $76), which is 12.7x our 2024 EPS.
The good: WRB saw low cat losses (in a high cat loss quarter) of $53.5 million, beating
our $85 million estimate and lower than $54.9 million last Q2. Premium growth picked
up to 8.7%, from 6.7% in Q1 and beat our 7.4% estimate. This was the strongest premium
growth quarter since Q3 2022. Further, WRB pointed to growth picking up from here and
flagged business continues to flow into the E&S market.
The bad: The current accident year combined ratio remains above 87% (at 87.6% in the
quarter), which was close to the 87.7% in Q1, but did rise from 86.2% last Q2, reflective
of elevated non-cat fire losses plus shifting business mix. WRB continues to see elevated
non-cat fire losses (the level was not quantified) and they said the magnitude slowed from
recent quarters, but remains above historical levels. WRB expects the property drag to
persist through this year, but at a decelerating clip.
The ugly: WRB did not provide the reserve development by line (the color comes in the
10-Q) but they said it was modest in both. If the development were modest in both
segments it implies that WRB saw a good level of accident year deterioration in its
insurance book, while showing a good amount of improvement in reinsurance. Some of
the accident year deterioration in insurance reflects the non-cat fire losses, but we believe
it also reflects business mix, and perhaps WRB using higher loss picks.
The stock from here: Shares are mostly unchanged after-hours, as we believe the
earnings beat and pick-up in growth is being counter-balanced by the weaker current
accident year combined ratio. The shares seem cheap to us (10.4x 2024 EPS) and WRB
has shown it is willing to step in when the shares are cheap (buying back $293 million in
Q2), and we expect a pick-up in top-line growth in Q3 could help serve as a catalyst for
shares, combined with the non-cat fire losses continuing to decline.

Q2 Beats On Lower Cats
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q2 EPS of $1.14, beating our $1.10 and consensus of $1.08. The upside
was due to catastrophe loses, which came in at $53.5 million and was lower than our $85 million and
down relative to $54.9 million last Q2. Prior year adverse favorable reserve development was $3
million, relative to estimate for $3 million of adverse development. WRB does not call out the level of
prior year development by segment until the 10-Q, but the company did say that it was not material in
either segment. Investment income came in at $245.2 million, versus our $245.1 million estimate, with
the core portfolio and arbitrage trading account coming in above us and investment funds falling short
of us. There were FX losses of $11.2 million that offset earnings by $0.03 per share.
The underlying combined ratio of 87.6% was above our 87.3% estimate; the underlying loss ratio came
in 70bps higher than us due to higher non-cat property losses and business mix. The expense ratio
was 40 basis points better than our estimate. WRB bought back $292.5 million shares in the quarter,
relative to our $60 million estimate, and the average diluted share count of 273.1 million was lower
than our 276.0 million estimate. The operating ROE was 18.1%, and the net income ROE was 21.1%.
Book value per share grew 1.3% QoQ.

What the Companies Are Saying - WRB
Outlook. WRB said that there continues to be a bifurcation in the standard market and E&S market.
Within the standard market, where National carriers do not have an appetite to write business that
is leading to opportunities on the E&S side. WRB said that submission flow remains robust, and they
are encouraged about activity over the balance of the year, and flagged good results in July. They said
liability lines pricing is the most competitive in larger size accounts, which is helping them as they are
more of a small and middle market player compared to peers. Overall WRB's view is that the industry
is struggling with the balance between rate needs and keeping up with loss trend versus their desire to
grow.
Pricing. WRB saw rate of 8.2% (ex workers' comp), which was relatively stable with the Q1 (at 8.3%)
and reflective of its business mix. Lines that WRB called out included public D&O where pricing is
eroding at a very rapid pace. They also flagged the plaintiff's bar as being challenging and impacting
commercial auto, general liability and umbrella. Property losses are spilling over into non-cat or risk-
property coverages where additional rate is needed. Within workers' comp, WRB expects medical
inflation to rise and to have a bigger impact as frequency has returned to more traditional norms, post
Covid-19.
Guidance. WRB only provided guidance around the expense ratio, which they said should be below
30.0% in 2023. The Q2 expense ratio was 28.1%, rising 40 basis points from last year due to: (1)
change in reinsurance structures, and (2) increased compensation costs and start-up operating unit
expenses. The expense ratio did improve sequentially from 28.8% in Q1.
They did point to non-cat weather continuing to have an impact on the underlying margin for the
remainder of the year but diminishing with each quarter. They did not provide an exact point impact
from the non-cat weather in Q2 but said it was lower than recent quarters but still elevated vs
historical averages. The last disclosed point impact was in Q4 2022, which was around 1.25 points.
While the company does not provide top-line growth guidance, they did allude to premium growth
picking up in H2 (which is similar to comments on last quarter's conference call) as they flagged robust
submission flow to the E&S market and said that they were encouraged with July results.
Investments. WRB saw investment income of $245.2 million in the quarter as the core fixed portfolio
saw a yield of 4.01% in the quarter, higher than 3.80% estimate. Investment income should continue
to be a tailwind for WRB as new money rates are well above the 4.2% book yield (new money yields
are 5.25+%). Investment funds returned a ($1.2 million) loss, below our $20.3 million estimate. The
investment funds are recorded on a one quarter lag, and they pointed to the underperformance due to
some private equity investments seeing some mark downs.
Liquidity and Capital. WRB's debt to capital ratio ended Q2 at 29.2%, which is below the YE 2022 level
of 29.6%, but higher than 29.0% at the end of the Q1 2023. Repurchases in the quarter totaled $292.5
million, which was higher than our $60 million estimate and a pick-up from $135.2 million in Q1.
WRB's call focused on pricing,
margins, prior year reserve
development, submission flow to
the E&S market, capital return
and investments

versus their desire to grow.
Q2 2023
Q1 2023
Regarding property, the company noted that its disappointment in Q4 pricing discipline has improved month over month, resulting
in what is regards as real progressing being made on the pricing front in April. The company feels the rationalization of pricing in
the property market, while more pronounced on the cat side, is broad-based overall. The company called out public D&O, certain
professional liability lines, and commercial auto as being the most irrational parts of the market. Still, WRB does see pockets of
opportunities even within professional liability, especially if written on an E&S basis.
WRB said they were disappointed in the discipline in property pricing in the Q4 as they said many carriers failed to take into
account limited reinsurance capacity and higher reinsurance costs. They believe that property pricing should continue to improve
as 2023 develops. For workers' comp, they said they missed the timing on when the market would begin to harden and they
expect pricing to be bumpy in 2023 with expectation for considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given severity trends,
particularly medical inflation. For auto, they said there is rate to be had but remains the most susceptible line to social inflation
and requires thought and judgement in underwriting for loss costs. Umbrella and general liability excess are amongst the brighter
opportunities with one area on the cautious watchlist being large account excess lines. Professional liability is a tale of two stores
with D&O being pressured given the rising competitive landscape but other lines within professional liability should provide good
opportunities. WRB said they participated at 1/1 renewals and said the clock is right to lean in with good discipline with the US
offering more attractive returns than international.
Q4 2022
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers'
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Q3 2022
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to see
resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth target,
which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust. In
workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity and
erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from that.
Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable momentum, up
45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing
is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.

Period
Pricing Comments
Q4 2021
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured
in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious and most of
the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive on WC pricing
in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this stage, particularly
in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any current opportunities.
Q3 2021
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a growing
headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we
don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty
writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and even more so
in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's definitely
encouraging
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers;
compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been
factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate
increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year. The simple
fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that are available in the
business. And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about possibly how we re-prioritize exposure of
growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q2 2021
June 2021
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the prior two being the early
2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to take
advantage of the hardening market environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three years,
while most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the E&S market,
Non-Deal
driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased audit premiums;
and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are at or approaching rate adequacy with the
exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the example of professional
liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more recently and workers' comp
is in a soft market.
Roadshow
(6/21/21)
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting meaningful rate increases.
And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many product lines where we have been getting rate on
rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.
The market is clearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think that is very appropriate. And
whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and 2002 and 2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is,
no cycle looks like any other cycle. When WRB looks at Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers'
compensation, is achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are seeing
meaningful firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella market, while property continues to be
notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL and but over the past couple of quarters that
seems to be building some momentum.

Summary of Estimate Changes
Estimates lowered. See below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q2 2023 earnings.
. 2023 EPS estimate is fairly unchanged at $4.75 (vs prior $4.74) driven by lower cats in the Q2
fully offset by weaker underlying assumptions.
. 2024 EPS is revised down to $5.95 (vs prior $6.05) reflecting weaker underlying margin
assumptions in insurance, which more than offsets higher investment income and a better margin
in reinsurance.
. 2025 EPS goes down to $6.80 (vs prior $7.00) to reflect weaker underlying margin assumptions
in insurance, which more than offsets higher investment income and a better margin in
reinsurance.

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB trades at 2.24x Q1 2023 book value, which is above the 5-year and 10-
year average multiples of 2.12x and 1.77x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 1.42x and 10-year
minimum is 1.11x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 2.99x, which is well above where the shares are
currently trading. We do note that for the P&C sector price-to-book valuations are fuller given the
unrealized losses we have seen in this rising interest rate environment. For WRB, if we exclude AOCI,
the shares are trading at just around 2.00x adjusted Q4 book. On a P/E basis, WRB is trading at 10.4x
our 2024 EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year average multiples of
17.7x and 16.8x, respectively. It is just above the 5-year minimum, which is 10.0x (during the low point
of the pandemic) and above the 10-year minimum of 10.0x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 25.0x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases in
2023, particularly as they lean in on property insurance and reinsurance, which should translate into a good level of premium growth in H2,
we do not believe this is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $75.00 from $76.00
Our price target of $75 is based on just around a 2.1x multiple of our year-end 2024 book value estimate. Our price target also represents
a ~12.7x multiple against our 2024 EPS estimate. The 12.7x is close to the lows where WRB has historically traded as we believe the
multiple may stay constrained until WRB returns to reporting stronger premium growth and sees the non-cat fire losses dissipate. With
that being said, the multiple still provides double-digit upside potential in the name.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe losses.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
