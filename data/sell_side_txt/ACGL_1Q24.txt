Arch Capital
Firing on All Cylinders
ACGL reported robust 1Q24 results, as upside in the reinsurance and MI
divisions offset a shortfall in insurance. We are Neutral on valuation, but view
Arch as a premier reinsurance franchise and consider ACGL the best name for
those seeking to invest based on the hard reinsurance pricing theme.
· EPS beat; raising estimates. ACGL announced 1Q24 operating EPS of $2.45,
well above our $2.11 estimate and consensus of $2.07. Compared to our model,
the upside was driven partly by lower cat losses (+$0.13 variance), more
favorable prior-year development (+$0.03), and lower tax rate (+$0.04
variance), offset by a slight shortfall in investment income (-$0.01). We are
raising our 2Q24 EPS forecast from $1.94 to $2.00 and our 2025 projection
from $8.24 to $8.64, to reflect accretion from the Allianz mid-market
commercial and entertainment insurance acquisition as well as higher than
previously assumed premiums and margins in reinsurance and MI.
· Business fundamentals were strong. Reinsurance results were lifted by
upside in both margins (CR 77.4% vs. our 83.8% estimate) and premiums
(+31% vs. +7%E). Margins benefited from lower attritional losses (despite 3.0
points related to the Baltimore bridge) and expenses. MI margins were better
than assumed as well (CR 14.4% vs. 19.9%E) and premiums earned were
boosted by the cancellation of the Bellemeade deals. Conversely, insurance
results fell short of expectations, with downside in margins (CR 94.1% vs.
91.3%E; including 2.1 points of attritional losses for the Baltimore bridge) and
premiums (+7% vs. +12%E). As assumed, ACGL did not repurchase stock in
1Q. Management's tone on business trends was very upbeat, particularly in the
property cat reinsurance and MI markets. High losses for the Baltimore bridge
($80 million pretax) was a key negative, which we attribute to ACGL's high
exposure to the marine line and partly to its conservatism on reserving.
. We expect ACGL's results to be strong in the near term, but our long-term
outlook is mixed. Our model projects robust margins and top-line growth in
re/insurance, and healthy margins but weak premium growth in mortgage
insurance. In the MI business, reserve releases related to COVID delinquencies
will decline, but we anticipate ongoing favorable development because of the
strong labor market and elevated house prices. Meanwhile, higher interest rates
should hold back growth but boost premium persistency and margins. In
reinsurance, margins should benefit from firm pricing, but sustained robust
margins are likely to drive softening terms/conditions. We assume no share
repurchases in the near term given ACGL's stock price and management's
intent to deploy capital into the business amid the favorable pricing backdrop.

· We maintain our Neutral rating. We consider ACGL a top-tier franchise, but
in commoditized markets. Although the company is well-positioned to benefit
from hard reinsurance pricing, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance
market is cautious. In addition, we feel that ACGL's valuation is not attractive
given its long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We reiterate our Neutral rating. Arch is a leading re/insurance
franchise with a track record of higher and less volatile
underwriting margins than most peers. Still, we are Neutral
because of our cautious long-term outlook for the P&C
reinsurance market and the stock's valuation. In our view, near-
term results in the MI business will be marked by weak premium
growth and moderating margins as attritional loss ratios
normalize higher. Over time, we expect MI returns to be held
back by the commoditized nature of the product, black box
pricing, and higher capital requirements, but results are likely to
be robust in the near term given ongoing reserve releases. In
P&C reinsurance, hard pricing and tighter terms/conditions
should boost underwriting results in the near term, but our long-
term outlook is negative as we remain skeptical of a sustained
hard market.

We are Neutral on valuation, but consider ACGL the best stock for investors
seeking to take advantage of the hard reinsurance market. ACGL is an industry-
leading reinsurance franchise with a unique culture and approach to underwriting that
should generate above-average and less volatile margins over time. The company is also
a leading mortgage insurer, a business that we believe is structurally better than P&C
reinsurance. In primary P&C, ACGL has expanded its position in wholesale/E&S
through the current hard market, and its pending acquisition of the Allianz book should
bolster its middle market franchise. Our outlook for near-term business trends is upbeat
as well, and we expect ACGL's results to benefit from firm prices and tight terms/
conditions in the re/insurance market as well as ongoing reserve releases in the MI
division. On the other hand, our long-term outlook is less upbeat, particularly in re/
insurance, as we anticipate a turn in the pricing cycle if reinsurers' margins remain close
to recent levels for the next 1-2 years. The reinsurance market suffers from structural
issues such as low barriers to entry, lack of differentiation among carriers, and limited
pricing power, and sustained robust margins should eventually drive an uptick in
competition. Moreover, we feel that ACGL's valuation already reflects investor
optimism for near-term results. Still, our overall view of Arch is upbeat and we could
get more bullish if the stock pulls back.
P&C Reinsurance: Near-Term Outlook Positive; L-T Cautious
Reinsurance margins should benefit from hard pricing and tighter terms, but our long-
term outlook remains cautious. ACGL has historically generated better and less volatile
margins than most reinsurers, which we attribute to its focus on specialty business
(where pricing is less competitive), conservative underwriting, ability to shift mix with
changing conditions, and judicious management of catastrophe risk. In particular, ACGL
prices business using the risk-free rate (leading to more conservative pricing) and uses a
long-term compensation plan for underwriters based on margins over multiple years.
Furthermore, the creation of 3rd party capital vehicles such as Premia Re generates fee
income for the firm. Still, our long-term outlook for reinsurance is cautious given its
commoditized nature, the ease of entry of new capital, and a broad set of capital
providers (including some, such as pension funds, with lower return thresholds). We are
skeptical of prolonged hard pricing and believe that 1-2 years of strong margins will
erode pricing discipline. Barring an above-average hurricane season, we expect pricing
momentum to slow, especially in higher layers of reinsurance programs, which are
attracting more capital. Any signs of softening of terms/conditions or new capacity will
likely hurt sentiment on reinsurance stocks, which are consensus longs.
MI: Margins to Normalize Lower, Growth Lackluster
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance via acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and United
Guaranty in 2016) when market conditions were favorable, with rising home prices,
stringent lending standards at lenders, and disciplined pricing by MI carriers. Arch's MI
business has generated healthy margins since and, despite the temporary setback from
COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have been strong. We expect MI margins,
which have been unsustainably strong, to revert to more normal levels as COVID-
related reserve releases taper off. Still, ACGL's conservative loss picks post-COVID,
the strong labor market, and appreciation of house prices should lift margins in the near
term. Higher interest rates are a headwind for sales but should boost persistency.

1Q24 Details
This evening, ACGL reported first quarter 2024 operating EPS of $2.45, significantly
above our $2.11 estimate and consensus of $2.07. Results were lifted by lower than
assumed catastrophe losses (+0.13 variance to our model), more favorable prior-year
development (+$0.03), and lower tax rate (+$0.04 variance), offset by a slight shortfall
in investment income (-$0.01).

no major unusual items
Business trends were strong. Compared with our model, reinsurance and mortgage
insurance results were significantly better than anticipated, while insurance results were
in-line. Reinsurance results were lifted by strong margins (CR 80.1% versus our 82.9%
estimate) and healthy premium growth (adjusted for one-time deals last year). As in
recent quarters, MI results were lifted by robust margins (CR -3.3% vs. 32.0%E), helped
by sizable releases of non-COVID reserves (-39.0% on CR vs. - 12.0%E). Insurance
margins were strong in an absolute sense, but fell short of our estimate (CR 93.2% vs.
91.4%E; CR ex. cats and PYD 89.9% vs. 89.7%E) due to higher than expected cat
losses and an uptick in the expense ratio. Premium growth was better than anticipated as
well (NWP +7.5% vs. +1.5%E) as upside in the reinsurance and insurance businesses
offset a shortfall in MI. As assumed, Arch did not repurchase stock in the fourth quarter.

Mortgage Ins .: Favorable Claims Experience Lifted Results
We expect mortgage insurance (MI) results to be marked by weak gross premium
growth, high persistency, and strong (but normalizing) margins. Higher interest
rates should suppress mortgage insurance volumes, while reserve releases should
moderate over time. Still, MI results have been significantly better than expected in
recent periods, and we feel that there is a greater likelihood of upside to our prospective
forecasts than downside. Also, net premium growth should benefit from higher retention
following the cancelation of the Bellemeade transactions. In 1Q24, the MI division
generated underwriting income of $271 million, well above our $215 million estimate,
driven by better than assumed margins (CR 14.5% vs. 19.9%E) and higher earned
premium growth (+3.0% vs. - 11.1%E). The upside in margins was due to a greater than
anticipated tailwind from favorable reserve development (-25.7% vs. - 22.0%E) and a
lower attritional loss ratio (22.7% vs. 24.5%E). Management attributed the reserve
releases to favorable cure rates, and the lower attritional losses to lower claim rates,
partially offset by higher delinquencies. Gross premium growth in the MI market was
sluggish (10th consecutive quarter of decline), but net written and net earned premium
growth benefited from the termination of Bellemeade agreements in 4Q23. In our view,
factors boosting margins in the MI business (higher rates, lower inventory of houses,
etc.) will continue to suppress gross premiums growth.
In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were hurt by artificially high delinquencies caused
by homeowners availing themselves of government forbearance programs. However,

after an initial spike in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has been steadily
declining. Following the expiry of forbearance programs, a significant portion of
previously delinquent loans has cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were taking
advantage of the mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial distress. In the
meantime, higher house prices have provided a cushion to homeowners under stress
who are struggling to pay their mortgages, limiting losses for MI carriers. The percent of
loans in default in the U.S. primary MI business was 1.65% at 3/31/2024, flat with
1.65% at 3/31/2023 and lower than 1.74% at 12/31/23.

We expect MI margins to continue to benefit from reserve releases, but to a lesser
extent than in prior quarters. Higher reported delinquencies at the onset of COVID
led Arch and its MI peers to establish corresponding reserves despite the healthy labor
market and appreciation in house prices. A meaningful portion of these delinquencies
was due to homeowners taking advantage of the government's forbearance protection
programs (to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship. Under U.S. GAAP
accounting, Arch had to establish reserves based on reported delinquencies despite the
high likelihood that these delinquencies would eventually cure (unlike other P&C lines
an IBNR component is disallowed under U.S. GAAP for primary MI business). With
most of these delinquent loans curing following the expiration of forbearance programs
(initially set for 12/31/20, but then extended through 9/30/21 and, in some cases, year-
end 2021 or beyond), ACGL has been releasing previously incurred reserves. At the
moment, more than 80% of MI reserves are from accident years after COVID,
suggesting less of a benefit from the release of reserves related to COVID
delinquencies. Even with this expected decline, however, we expect MI margins to
remain healthy given the strong labor and housing markets, cures on previously
delinquent loans, and the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due to the
appreciation in house prices. Higher interest rates are a positive for margins as well as
they are causing homeowners to stay longer in their existing houses (where they have
more equity), thereby improving persistency in the MI book. On a cautious note, top-
line growth in the MIS business is likely to be weak as higher interest rates reduce
mortgage originations. Although a weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead
to higher mortgage defaults, a material uptick in losses seems unlikely in the near term.
Barring a recession, we expect core margins to stay healthy, though declining reserve
releases will drive margins and earnings lower even if economic trends stay favorable.

ACGL has become a leading competitor in the MI market through acquisitions and
could expand further via M&A, although deals seem unlikely in the near term.
ACGL entered the mortgage re/insurance business in 2011 but was only marginally
involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit
unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The company's
2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger
foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P)
and gained distribution in the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch became a top 10
competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market position strengthened
further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which
catapulted it to a top-3 spot (as part of the deal AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance
blocks originated by UGC pre 2017). Arch has also expanded in foreign MI markets
through M&A, including its acquisition of Westpac's mortgage insurance business in
Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Shortfall Margins and Premiums Drove Miss
ACGL's insurance business reported lower than expected underwriting margins
and premium growth. The division generated underwriting income of $86 million in
1Q24, considerably below our $130 million estimate. Underwriting margins were
weaker than assumed on both a reported (CR 94.1% vs. 91.3%E) and core (CR ex. cats
and PYD 92.7% vs. 89.6%E) basis. Premium growth missed as well on both a net
written (+7.3% vs. +12.4%E) and earned basis (+15.4% vs. +19.0%E). The company
reflected the Baltimore bridge collapse in its loss ratio (+201 bps on CR) but core
margins would have fallen short of expectations regardless. Cat losses were roughly in
line with our expectation (1.9% on CR versus 2.0%E).

Arch's primary P&C business is benefiting from favorable pricing but, despite
firm pricing, we expect margins in the business to stay roughly flat. After shrinking
its "cycle managed" business (now called as wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to
2017, ACGL is seeing strong growth in this part of its primary book, driven by price
hikes in the broader market, particularly in E&S. Results in less opportunistic parts of
ACGL's book (specialty small/middle market and franchise) have been healthy as well.
High inflation and rising reinsurance costs are driving an uptick in insurance pricing,
especially in property and cat-exposed lines. Despite these price increases, we do not

anticipate a material improvement in primary commercial lines margins at Arch and
peers because of headwinds from higher inflation and reinsurance costs. Also, reserve
development could become less of a tailwind because of adverse loss trends emerging in
older accident years. Management teams at insurance underwriters as well as many
investors are optimistic about improving non-cat margins at commercial insurers, but we
feel that assessing results on a non-cat basis is not as relevant given the significant
increase in reinsurance retentions at primary companies. On an overall combined
ratio basis, results for most primary insurers were weak in 2023, precisely because of
elevated cat losses. In contrast, reinsurers' cat losses have not increased to the same
extent. In our opinion, consensus EPS forecasts for commercial lines insurers do not
adequately reflect the shift in cat loads from reinsurers to primary carriers following the
uptick in retention levels with 2023 reinsurance renewals.
Reinsurance: Upside Driven by Strong Margins
The reinsurance business exceeded expectations on both margins and premiums.
The business generated underwriting income of $379 million in 1Q24, well above our
$272 million estimate. The combined ratio was 77.4%, lower than our 83.8%
assumption, as lower attritional losses (53.7% vs. 56.8%E), catastrophe claims (1.8% vs.
5.0%E), and expenses (24.4% vs. 25.2%E), more than offset lower than expected
favorable development (-2.5% vs. - 3.2%E). Claims in 1Q24 include 3.0 points related to
the Baltimore bridge collapse ($50 million reported in attritional losses), as well as gross
catastrophe claims of 1.9 points ($32 million) spread across several global events. Gross
written premium (GPW) growth was robust (+40.9% vs. +4.2%E), reflecting favorable
pricing conditions in the reinsurance market (particularly property cat), incremental
client demand, and ACGL's increased appetite to write risk. Strong GPW growth, along
with lower retentions, translated to better net written premium growth (+31.3% vs.
+6.9%E). Management sounded upbeat on Arch's positioning amid capacity constraints
in the property cat market. The increase in reinsurance attachment points in early 2023
shifted the risk of cat losses from reinsurers to primary carriers, and management
indicated that terms remain fairly consistent with last year.

market for casualty coverage in the early 2000s. Over the years, however, management
has shifted Arch Re's business mix away from casualty risks towards other specialty
lines such as surety, accident and health, agriculture, and trade credit, which are
generally less competitive and have more attractive risk-reward. The hard pricing
environment has boosted results in recent years and is causing management to increase
its exposure to property coverages. This, in turn, should drive continued strong
premiums and margins in the near term. Still, we expect the pace of price hikes to
moderate longer term and remain skeptical of a sustained hard reinsurance market.
Factors that contributed to a multi-year soft market prior to 2018 (glut of capital, greater
fluidity/speed of capital, more providers of capacity, broker consolidation) are still
prevalent, and should preclude prolonged hard pricing. On a positive note, ACGL's
reinsurance results could benefit from the release of COVID-related reserves, a portion
of which remain in IBNR. Similarly, loss reserves for Ian could ultimately prove to be
too conservative (most reinsurers booked higher Ian-related losses than primary
carriers). Nonetheless, ACGL management is leaning into the hard market and the
company seems better positioned to take advantage of the current environment than
most peers.
Raising EPS Estimates
We are raising 2Q24 EPS from $1.94 to $2.00 and 2025 EPS from $8.24 to $8.64.
Our 2024 EPS estimate is increasing as well, from $7.92 to $8.48 to reflect upside in
1Q24 results. Our revised model reflects higher than previously assumed margins for
the reinsurance and MI businesses as well as accretion from the acquisition of the
Allianz mid-markets book. We consider catastrophe losses (which would affect
reinsurance and insurance margins) and housing market conditions (which affect MI
margins and premium growth) the key sources of potential variance in reported results
and our projections.

Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $96.00)
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premier re/insurance franchise, but bullish investor sentiment and
valuation keep us from being more positive on the stock. Arch is a leading reinsurance
business that we project to report superior and less volatile underwriting margins over time
because of its unique culture and approach to the market. Also, Arch is a top competitor in
mortgage insurance (MI), which we consider structurally better business than P&C
reinsurance. In the near term, we expect MI results to be marked by weak premium growth
and compressing, albeit still robust margins. In reinsurance, firm pricing should boost both
premium growth and margins in the near future. However, our long-term view of the
reinsurance business is cautious. The reinsurance business suffers from structural issues
such as low barriers to entry, lack of differentiation by carrier, and limited pricing power.
As such, we expect sustained high margins to erode price discipline and lead to an uptick
in competition. Lastly, investor sentiment on ACGL is bullish and the stock's valuation is
not compelling relative to the company's long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2024 price target from $92 to $96 to reflect our higher EPS
and book value forecasts. Our price target assumes a 1.7x multiple on our 12/31/24E BV ex.
AOCI forecast, a 1.7x multiple on our 12/31/24E BV forecast, and an 11.0x multiple on our
2025 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach with a sum-of-the-parts analysis that
values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from mortgage insurance. Our target
multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix, which has become less skewed to
mortgage insurance. ACGL trades at 1.9x BV and 10.8x 2024E EPS compared to 1.4x and
7.4x for the reinsurance sector, 1.1x and 8.2x for MI peers, and 2.5x and 14.0x for the broader
P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for an extended period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. In
our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, even as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
· The company announces a sizable share repurchase program. Steady repurchases
by leading reinsurers could help prolong the hard market as well as drive an uptick in
EPS forecasts.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· Additional capacity enters the reinsurance market. This, in turn, could result in a
reversal in pricing trends and potentially drive a reduction in EPS estimates as well as
hurt sentiment on the sector.
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development has

this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
