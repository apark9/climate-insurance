Jan. '22 Earnings: Beat Yet Loss Picks
In Focus
While PGR is making sequential progress improving its AY loss
ratio, we question the integrity of PGR's loss picks. Adverse PYD
taken on rising severity should translate to higher not lower loss
picks going forward.

Potential Upside/Downside
-19.6%
PGR's underlying loss ratio of 68.8% was much better than our expected 76.2%. We draw our
attention to PGR's 4.1 pts of adverse PYD, of which 80% related to continued higher repair costs
and higher severity (physical damage, collision and comprehensive). Particularly, PGR
characterized this rise in severity as continuing (not abating). We are seeing opposite
indications of used car sales based on CPI vs. Manheim data (see Figures 5 & 6). Where we pause
- if rising severity is the new normal then loss picks should be rebased; we just did not see that
in the January print thanks to Omicron. Recall, ALL also took adverse PYD in 4Q21 in auto.
Layering in PYD catch up makes us pause on concluding an indicative trend based on monthly
prints. It may be prudent to take a step back and assess progression on underlying performance
over a multi-month period.
PIF growth slowdown: PGR's total personal auto (including Specialty) PIF y/y growth slowed
(+4.8% vs. our estimate of +4.7%) driven by a slowdown in auto direct (+5.9% vs. our +5.7%) and
auto agency (+1.8% vs. our +2.1%). We anticipate a long grind for PGR to get back to rate
adequacy and double-digit PIF growth. PGR plans to take multiple bites of the apple in its rate
request journey. We include in this note our analysis of PGR's approved and pending rate
filings (the latter on 25% of its premiums).

Jan. operating EPS of $0.51 beat our $0.29 estimate primarily on a lower tax rate, and better
underlying loss ratio, tempered by more adverse PYD (we modeled nil) than our expectations.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving business
mix, which could lower ROEs. Likewise,
we struggle to see how PGR could
return to its historical PIF growth rate,
as the company cut rates early during
the pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 120.00
If PGR is able to achieve personal auto
rate adequacy and return to historical
PIF growth rates. If PGR leverages its
multivariate pricing model across
newer business lines. Upside case
reflects ~28x '22E EPS and ~24x '23E
EPS.
Downside case
USD 75.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with greater
rate catch up. Downside case reflects
~17x '22E EPS and ~15x '23E EPS.

Looking at January renewal effective dates, PGR received 25 rate approvals in 7 states: AR, KS,
MS, NC, PA, TN, VA, ranging from 0% to ~11.8%. PGR's rate approvals show a weighted average
of +6.2% approvals on ~$1.7bn of subject premiums, or ~$105mn in additional premiums, which
in our view does not move the needle that much.
Last year, PGR swiftly graduated from rebates to rate decreases well ahead of the industry. This
implies that PGR has to catch up more than other industry participants on the rate side to get to
a better baseline pricing spot.
Pending Filings: So far the total ask is +8.9% on subject premiums
PGR has submitted pending rate increases through renewal effective dates May '22 in just 11
states, not nationwide: DC, FL, GA, HI, ID, MD, MI, NJ, NV, OH, TX. Similar to the approved filings,
PGR's pending rate increases show a weighted average of 8.9% approvals on ~$9.2bn of subject
premiums, or ~$819mn in additional premiums. While pending rate ask looks more promising
than rate approvals thus far, we still do not think this is enough to make a significant impact
considering the scope of PGR's total personal auto written premiums. To put that in context,
PGR reported ~$36.2bn of personal auto premiums in 2021, therefore pending rate requests are
on about a quarter of its premiums.
PIF Growth Spotlight
PIF growth y/y trend continued to fall in January across agent (+1.8%)
and direct (+5.9%).
PGR reported total auto (including Specialty) PIF growth of -0.2% m/m (in line with our modeled
-0.2%).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Barclays | Progressive Corp.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $85 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.9x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2022E/2023E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
