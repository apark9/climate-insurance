WRB: A Consistent Message from Berkley; Q3 and Conference Call Roundup
Our Call
WRB reported Q3 EPS of $1.35, above our $1.20 and consensus of $1.18 due to higher
investment income and lower taxes. Gross premiums growth was 8.8% (just below 9.3% in
Q2) but net premium growth was 10.5% (from 8.7%) due to strong insurance growth.
Estimate and price target changes: We are slightly raising our 2023 EPS estimate
to $4.88 (from $4.73) on the $0.15 beat vs. us in Q3. Our 2024 and 2025 EPS are
unchanged at $6.15 and $7.10, respectively. Our $75 price target represents just over 12x
our 2024 EPS estimate.
The stock: Shares are indicating flat after hours, which we believe reflects this mostly
being an in-line quarter, away from NII.
Takes for the group: The biggest take for us is that WRB pointed to still pushing for
price (+8.5% in insurance ex comp in the quarter) with a 20% ROE given the persistence
of social inflation. Further, they pointed to the market accepting these rate increases
with a stable renewal retention of around 80%. Away from underwriting, they seemed
positive on investment income continuing to build from here with a new money yield of
6%, relative to the portfolio yield of 4.5%.
The good: NPW growth of 10.5% beat our 9.6% with strong growth in insurance (short-
tail, liability and commercial auto), while property reinsurance growth slowed to 7.7%
(lapping a tough comp of 41.2% last year). NII of $271m was ahead of our $253m on
better core NII and returns on the arbitrage trading account. Price increases ex workers'
compensation picked up to 8.5% (from 8.2%) and there was a modest $1 million of
reserve releases, with nothing of significance called out in either segment.
The bad: Underwriting income in Insurance of $208m came in below our $218m on a
modestly higher ex. cat loss ratio; the expense ratio was also 40 bps above us. The overall
expense ratio of 28.3% was a touch above our 28.1% estimate. WRB continues to target
an expense ratio that is comfortably below 30%. Buybacks of $2.9m in the quarter slowed
from the pace in the first half of 2023 (vs. $135m in Q1 and $293m in Q2), although
there was a $129 million special dividend in the quarter.
The ugly: There was not a lot to call ugly in the quarter. However, while insurance growth
picked up to 12.1% on a net basis (from 8.6% in Q2), reinsurance was flat as growth in
property and mono-line excess was offset by a 6.4% decline in professional lines. See
inside for highlights of key issues for WRB.

Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe
that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate
increases in 2023 and 2024, particularly as they lean in on property
insurance and reinsurance, which should translate into a good level
of premium growth, which we do not believe is currently reflected in
consensus expectations.

Base Case | $75.00
. Our price target of $75 is based on just
around a 2.2x multiple of our year-end
2024 book value estimate
· Our price target also represents a
~12.2x multiple against our 2024 EPS
estimate.
. The 12.2x is close to the lows where
WRB has historically traded as
we believe the multiple may stay
constrained until WRB returns to
reporting stronger premium growth and
sees the non-cat fire losses dissipate.
With that being said, the multiple still
provides double-digit upside potential in
the name.
Upside Scenario | $102.00
· In the upside scenario we use a multiple
of 3x 2024 book value, close to peak
valuation levels.
. We assume WRB is able to see
consistent double-digit premium
growth, margin expansion and good
investment returns resulting in industry
leading returns.
· Assumes lack of significant adverse
development in its reserves.
Downside Scenario | $55.00
· In the downside scenario we use
a multiple of 9X 2024 EPS (which
translates into 1.6x book value) and is
below trough levels (although those
multiples were in lower interest rate
environments).
.
In this scenario WRB could see lower
premium growth, margin compression
and volatility within its investment
returns.
· Also the downside scenario could
include volatility within its reserves and
potential adverse development on the
softer market years (2016-2019).
Upcoming Catalysts
· WRB's 10-Q which comes out after earnings and will give
additional color on its reserve development for the quarter
· Monthly pricing surveys, which will highlight the overall strength
(or lack thereof) of the commercial lines pricing environment

Q3 Highlights
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q3 EPS of $1.35, beating our $1.20 and consensus of $1.18. The upside
was due to higher investment income (investment income came in at $271 million, higher than our
$253 million estimate) and lower taxes (the operating income tax rate was 20.6%, a bit below our
21.0% estimate). Catastrophe losses came in at $61.5 million, lower than our $65 million and down
relative to $94 million last Q3. Prior year favorable reserve development was $1 million, relative
to estimate for $3 million of adverse development. WRB does not call out the level of prior year
development by segment until the 10-Q, but on its call they did say that there was nothing notable
to call out in either segment. Investment income came in at $270.9 million, better than our $252.6
million estimate, with the core portfolio, arbitrage trading account and investment funds all coming in
above us. There were FX gains of $22.5 million that benefited earnings by $0.07 per share.
The underlying combined ratio of 87.9% was a touch above our 87.6% estimate; the underlying loss
ratio came in 10bps higher than us. The expense ratio was 20 basis points better than our estimate as
change in reinsurance structures and start-up expenses impacted the level of expenses. WRB bought
back $2.9 million shares in the quarter, relative to our $100 million estimate, but the company did have
$129 million of special dividends in the quarter. The average diluted share count of 271.4 million was
higher than our 270.6 million estimate. The operating ROE was 21.7%, and the net income ROE was
19.8%. Book value per share was essentially flat sequentially at $26.80.

What the Companies Are Saying - WRB
WRB's call focused on pricing,
margins, social inflation, prior
year reserve development,
capital return and investments
Outlook
Overall the quarter generated a 20% return, without any one-timers, which is a reflection of how the
current book is performing. WRB said that social inflation continues to burn, and they do not see that
abating any time soon, and this should serve as a catalyst as they continue to push for price, even as
interest rates rise. Auto in particular is a line that they are paying close attention to, and they cautioned
this can spill over into excess and umbrella.
Pricing
They are very focused on social inflation as shown by their 8.5% price increase excluding workers'
compensation in the quarter (up from 8.2% in Q2). The marketplace has been accepting of the price
increases as shown by its steady renewal retention at 80%. They did point to the auto line potentially
turning and getting more rate, which led to strong growth (+16.2%) in commercial auto in Q3. They
are not taking the pedal off when it comes to rate, even with a ROE of around 20%. This is due to the
ongoing concerns surrounding social inflation and loss cost trend. While financial/economic inflation is
slowing, there is no evidence social inflation is abating at all.
Guidance
WRB does not provide much in the way of guidance. They have said that the expense ratio should
be comfortably below 30% but can fluctuate mostly depending on if WRB starts de novo businesses
that need to grow to scale (could pressure the expense ratio temporarily). Some items impacting the
expense ratio in the quarter included: (1) change in outward reinsurance structures impacting their
ceding commissions, (2) compensation-relate costs, and (3) start up operating expenses as well as
investments in technology.
Investments
The book yield is 4.5% with a new money yield of around 6%. WRB pushed asset duration out slightly to
2.4 years vs. 2.3 years last quarter, and management said that it expects it is likely that it will continue
to push out duration and lock in higher rates.
Liquidity and Capital
WRB's debt to capital ratio ended Q3 at 29.1%, which is below the YE 2022 level of 29.6%, and flat vs.
29.2% at the end of Q2 2023. Repurchases in the quarter totaled $2.9 million, well below our $100
million estimate and down from $292.5 million in Q2. The company did pay out $129 million of special
dividends in the quarter and the payout ratio (as a % of operating earnings) was 43.7%, relative to over
100% in Q1 and Q2.

Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period
Pricing Comments
Q3 2023
WRB is very focused on social inflation and they said that you can see that in their rate increases (8.5% excluding workers'
compensation) and they ntend to stay on top of it. The market has been accepting of its rate increases as shown in its steady
renewal retention of 80%. Specifically WRB is pushing very hard on rate within commercial auto and the market is accpeting of it -
this led to strong growth in commercial auto in the quarter.
Q2 2023
WRB saw rate of 8.2% (ex workers' comp), which was relatively stable with the Q1 (at 8.3%) and reflective of its business mix.
WRB said that there continues to be a bifurcation in the standard market and E&S market. Within the standard market, where
National carriers do not have an appetite to write business that is leading to opportunities on the E&S side. WRB said that
submission flow remains robust, and they are encouraged about activity over the balance of the year, and flagged good results in
July. Overall WRB's view is that the industry is struggling with the balance between rate needs and keeping up with loss trend
versus their desire to grow.
Q1 2023
Regarding property, the company noted that its disappointment in Q4 pricing discipline has improved month over month, resulting
in what is regards as real progressing being made on the pricing front in April. The company feels the rationalization of pricing in
the property market, while more pronounced on the cat side, is broad-based overall. The company called out public D&O, certain
professional liability lines, and commercial auto as being the most irrational parts of the market. Still, WRB does see pockets of
opportunities even within professional liability, especially if written on an E&S basis.
WRB said they were disappointed in the discipline in property pricing in the Q4 as they said many carriers failed to take into
account limited reinsurance capacity and higher reinsurance costs. They believe that property pricing should continue to improve
as 2023 develops. For workers' comp, they said they missed the timing on when the market would begin to harden and they
expect pricing to be bumpy in 2023 with expectation for considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given severity trends,
particularly medical inflation. For auto, they said there is rate to be had but remains the most susceptible line to social inflation
and requires thought and judgement in underwriting for loss costs. Umbrella and general liability excess are amongst the brighter
opportunities with one area on the cautious watchlist being large account excess lines. Professional liability is a tale of two stores
with D&O being pressured given the rising competitive landscape but other lines within professional liability should provide good
opportunities. WRB said they participated at 1/1 renewals and said the clock is right to lean in with good discipline with the US
offering more attractive returns than international.
Q4 2022
Q3 2022
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers'
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to see
resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth target,
which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust. In
workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity and
erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from that.
Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable momentum, up
45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Source: Company reports and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Period
Pricing Comments
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing is
currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.
Q4 2021
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured
in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious and most of
the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive on WC pricing
in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this stage, particularly
in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any current opportunities.
Q3 2021
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a growing
headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we
don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty
writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and even more so
in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's definitely
encouraging.
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers;
compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been
factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate
increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year. The simple
fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that are available in the
business. And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about possibly how we re-prioritize exposure of
growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q2 2021
June 2021
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the prior two being the early
2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to take
advantage of the hardening market environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three years,
while most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the E&S market,
driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased audit premiums;
(6/21/21)
and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are at or approaching rate adequacy with the
exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the example of professional
liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more recently and workers' comp
is in a soft market.
Non-Deal
Roadshow
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting meaningful rate increases.
And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many product lines where we have been getting rate on
rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB trades at 2.35x Q3 2023 book value, which is above the 5-year and 10-
year average multiples of 2.15x and 1.80x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 1.42x and 10-year
minimum is 1.11x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 2.99x, which is well above where the shares are
currently trading. We do note that for the P&C sector price-to-book valuations are fuller given the
unrealized losses we have seen in this rising interest rate environment. For WRB, if we exclude AOCI,
the shares are trading at just around 2x adjusted Q3 book. On a P/E basis, WRB is trading at 11.1x
consensus 2024 EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year average multiples
of 17.3x and 16.8x, respectively. It is just above the 5-year minimum, which is 10.0x (during the low
point of the pandemic) and above the 10-year minimum of 10.0x. The 5-year and 10-year max is
25.0x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases
in 2023 and 2024, particularly as they lean in on property insurance and reinsurance, which should translate into a good level of premium
growth, which we do not believe is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $75.00 from NC
. Our price target of $75 is based on just around a 2.2x multiple of our year-end 2024 book value estimate
. Our price target also represents a ~12.2x multiple against our 2024 EPS estimate.
. The 12.2x is close to the lows where WRB has historically traded as we believe the multiple may stay constrained until WRB returns to
reporting stronger premium growth and sees the non-cat fire losses dissipate. With that being said, the multiple still provides double-
digit upside potential in the name.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe losses.

Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
