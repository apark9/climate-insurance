June '23: $1.1bn Adverse PYD Toll for
1H23
Higher ultimate severity drove June increases in prior and
current accident year loss ratios (3.1 pts and 6.5 pts,
respectively). At least FL reform was not cited again, but the
narrative has shifted back to property damage compared to
bodily injury and PIP cited as drivers in April & May.
We think market reaction to the June print is appropriate and the stock could face more
disappointment. Consistent with our long-standing commentary, remediation is going to be a
long ride for PGR and other auto insurers to get back to pre-pandemic levels. It is challenging
to get a pulse on the key driver of PGR's view of loss trend. On the PYD side, PGR cited
severity property damage this month, April & May bodily injury and PIP were drivers (alongside
FL tort), March FL tort was cited, and January-February property damage, collision and
comprehensive coverages were cited. We are getting more questions from investors on
management credibility.
Capital may be fine since PGR is shrinking PIF (down 8.2k q/q and that shrinking momentum
should amplify); however, 1H23 cat losses of ~$1.3bn, 1H23 AY strengthening of $1.1bn and CY
strengthening of $631mn could add pressure to capital. PGR also raised $500mn of debt in May
for general corporate purposes. We think PGR is better positioned on capital than ALL. We
estimate YE22 group RBC of 470% for PGR vs. 206% for ALL.
Expense Ratio Record: PGR's 16.0% expense ratio in June hit a new record low, following 16.3%
(a record low at the time) in May '23 and 17.1% in April '23. A more sustainable expense ratio for
PGR is >20%. PGR's expense cutting efforts is not enough to solidify its 96% combined ratio
target.
Combined ratio Miss
PGR's combined ratio of 104.9% missed our estimated 99.0% and was above management's
96% target (Personal Lines at 103.2% vs. our estimated 96.5%, Commercial Lines at 99.4% vs our
estimated 96.9%, and Property at 157.3% vs. our estimated 153.0%).
· PGR reported a sixth consecutive month of unfavorable PYD of $137.8mn (vs. $162.4mn
estimate) or 3.1 pts on the loss ratio (vs. our 3.7 pt estimate). This follows 3.5 pts, 3.4 pts, 2.6
pts, and 4.6 pts of unfavorable PYD in February, March, April, and May, respectively.
. PGR's underlying loss ratio of 76.6%, was worse than our estimated 74.3%. PGR took

$291.2mn of actuarial adverse adjustments, or 6.5 pts, which muddies monthly
comparisons. We question if PGR's loss picks are too optimistic and would be subject to re-
estimates (i.e., unfavorable PYD) in future periods.
· PGR's expense ratio was 16.0% in June vs. 16.3% in May, and 17.1% in Apr. We estimated a
17.0% expense ratio. To recap, PGR's pre-pandemic expense ratio ran just north of 20%.
· PGR reported catastrophe losses of $415mn vs. our $175mn estimate.
Personal Auto PIF Declined by 8.2k Q/Q
Personal auto PIF was down 8.2k (June '23 vs. May '23), worse than the previous +0.7%
sequential print (May '23 vs. Apr '23). On a y/y basis, PGR reported personal auto PIF growth of
+14.4% in June (below our estimate of +15.0% y/y), as auto agency PIF (+10.7% vs. our +11.3%)
and auto direct (+17.4% vs. our 18.0%) underperformed our estimates.
PGR's pre-tax net investment income (ex expenses) this month was $153mn vs. our $155mn
estimate, reflecting a 3.14% pre-tax annualized book yield.
June operating EPS of $(0.13) missed our $0.23 estimate, reflecting a higher combined ratio due
to worse-than-expected underlying loss ratio and catastrophes losses.

Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 135.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~24x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 103.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~18x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +14.4% in June (below our estimate of +15.0%),
as auto agency PIF (+10.7% vs. our +11.3%) and auto direct (+17.4% vs. our 18.0%)
underperformed our estimates.

Underlying combined ratio - Lower expense ratio is
less sustainable over the long term
PGR's underlying combined ratio of 92.6% in June deteriorated from 89.5% in May and 88.1% in
Apr. driven by a worse underlying loss ratio of 76.6% (vs. 73.2% in May) slightly offset by a lower
expense ratio (16.0% in June vs 16.3% in May and 17.1% in Apr.) While we were expecting a
lower-than-typical expense ratio, PGR's 16.0% expense ratio in June hit a record low.
The construction of PGR's underlying combined ratio is different than pre-pandemic. To recap,
PGR's pre-pandemic underlying loss ratio stood at ~68% and expense ratio ran just north of
20%. We think a reversion to this pre-pandemic composition would be positive for the stock.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
Our focus is on an absolute basis, where motor insurance pricing remains elevated relative to
used car pricing using a 2019 base year (see Figure 4). Specifically, used car & truck pricing is up
41.0% vs. motor insurance pricing at 23.2% since Jan. '19. We pay lesser attention to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers, which rose 3.0% over the 12 months from
June 2022 to June 2023. Used car and truck CPI trails all items at -5.2% in June vs. - 4.2% in May.

Manheim pricing was -3.2% m/m and -9.4% y/y. More importantly, if we compare June '23 to
June '19, Manheim pricing is still up 41.8%. Compounded auto pricing during that period has
not caught up - not anywhere close. There is still significant rate catch-up needed to see that
inflection point. It will be like an "x"; loss costs go down, then pricing goes up - where the two
intersect in our view can take a bit longer, especially given how long it is taking auto pricing to
actually "earn" in.

Valuation
Valuation: Our PT of $103 (down from $120) is based on 16.5x (unchanged) our '24E EPS of $5.66
(down from $7.24) and 3.2x (unchanged) '24E BVPS (ex AOCI) of $35.23 (down from $37.55).
Model Updates:
We increase our loss ratio expectations to reflect a higher AYLR and the continuation of adverse
PYD reflecting higher severity expectations. We lower our expense ratio and PIF assumptions.
Updated Operating EPS: We revise '23E from $4.77 to $3.77 and '24E from $7.24 to $5.66.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within
the next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or
an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $115 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended 10.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.78x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.

Valuation Methodology: Our $103PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double-digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
