TRV: Reserves Take Center Stage; Sell-Side Meeting Soundbites
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
TRV hosted a sell-side meeting post Q2 EPS. In a word the focus was on reserves post the
$250m reserve addition in Q2. TRV wanted the message to be that there was a different
level of confidence as they took action on some very immature years.
Initial Thoughts
Reserves: TRV adjusted its GL loss development factors to allow for rising settlement
costs and lengthening settlement patterns. TRV believes they are ahead of the industry
given the movement they have seen in loss picks relative to starting points in Other
Liability Occurrence, which we show inside. While we believe TRV could be ahead of the
industry we are not convinced that there will not be future additions, and we will need
quarters of no noise for us to be comfortable in no future charges.
Not promising there won't be more: While not saying they will not take another GL
charge, TRV wanted the messaging to be that there is a different level of confidence
this quarter as they proactively and decisively added IBNR to very immature accident
years. Travelers said that they looked at what was going on with actual versus expected,
and they were not willing to bank on this being a one quarter event and instead are now
applying the claims patterns across all claims they are going to see.
What got worse in the past three months: When asked what got worse in the past three
months, they said it was a combination of stuff including an aggressive plaintiff bar, third-
party litigation, and sympathetic juries and judges. Selective (which also added to GL
reserves in Q2) said they took up their loss trend assumption in GL from 4% in 2020 to 9%
in 2024. When asked, TRV said they do not provide loss trend by line, but did say that they
did not see the same doubling of trend that SIGI saw.
Did not affect current accident year: Travelers said that the Q2 GL reserve addition
did not affect the current accident year, as the accident year is the aggregate of all lines,
which have puts and takes. Further, they had already reflected this, as on their Q1 call
they said that they had some extra IBNR in the current accident year for the uncertainty
environment. On the pricing side, TRV said that they are already seeing upward pressure
on pricing, which they expect to accelerate.
What else: Home: The 5 points of favorable non-cat weather in home was from fire and
non-cat weather water. Auto: The 2.5 points of favorability called out in auto was from
frequency and severity that were better than TRV expected. CrowdStrike: CrowdStrike
could lead to BI losses and most cyber policies have BI coverage in them. Based on the
event and its policy forms, TRV said that it is not high up on its worry list. Its hours clauses
are typically 8-24 (and maybe 48) hours.

Other Liability Occurrence-Incurred Loss Ratios
Other liability occurrence loss picks. Below we show the initial versus developed loss picks for the
Other Liability Occurrence line for TRV and the industry. Travelers highlighted that they have seen
more development on years relative to the rest of the industry. They characterized themselves
as outperforming in the mature years (2014-2016), being most responsive in the middle year
(2017-2019) and being early in the green years (2020-2023). The below data is as of YE 2023, so is
before the $350m of additions they took on accident years 2021-2023 so far this year. In the back we
also show the other liability occurrence and paid loss trends for the other commercial insurers under
our coverage (AIG, CB, HIG, WRB, as well as for the P&C industry),

Other Liability Occurrence-Paid to Incurred Trends
TRV's paid-to-incurred trends within other liability occurrence screen better than the industry for
recent AYs. Although still relatively early, TRV's paid-to-incurred trends for the more recent accident
years screen favorable vs the industry's for the other liability-occurrence line as 2020 (51.3% vs
49.5%) is the only year modestly above the industry, while the rest are below as 2021 is at a 33.5% (vs
37.5%), 2022 is at 17.9% (vs 22.3%) and 2023 is at 3.0% (vs 8.2% for the industry).

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the good pricing environment within commercial lines and improving margins within
personal auto. With that being said, we think there are questions on their reserves following the increases for liability lines in H1 and as a
result, we think the shares could underperform the broader group until they show a lack of movement on the reserve side. We rate the
shares Equal Weight
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $206.00 from NC
. Our price target of $206 is based on just over 10.0x our 2025 EPS estimate.
. Implies around a ~1.6x multiple of our projected 2025 book value estimate of ~$129.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth, reported / underlying margins coming in better than expected, and higher-
than-expected favorable PYD.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
FINRA regulation requires member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories: Buy, Hold and Sell. In accordance with FINRA regulation and solely to
satisfy those disclosure requirements in the ratings distribution table and ratings history chart contained in these Required Disclosures, our rating of Overweight
corresponds to a Buy rating; Equal Weight corresponds to a Hold rating; and Underweight corresponds to a Sell rating.
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
