2Q EPS: As Good As It Gets?
Stock Rating
OVERWEIGHT
Unchanged
Our first glance at the 2Q print showed higher NII, NPW growth and margin expansion all
working together. Which begs the question: is this as good as it gets? Our take, not yet
but we are mindful that GDP growth moderation could temper the premium growth
trajectory. Still, management has done a nice job enhancing its franchise value as seen
in the print and should have some staying power even when macro tailwinds taper off.
We question how 'transitory' CPI type of inflation will be for P/C insurers bottom line. It
will also take some time to assess the conservatism of HIG's accident year loss picks and
higher pace of reserve releases. HIG attributed higher auto frequency trends, still below
pre-pandemic levels, but unlike others it was silent on auto severity. We think bad driving
habits were established during the pandemic. There is a lot riding on HIG's ultimate BSA
payout to resemble the $650mn settlement that looks like may not hold up (disclosure
approval hearing on Aug 12), otherwise we question if HIG's capital returns could be
minimized. Still, it may take many years for the ultimate insurance payout to materialize
conceivably beyond the time stamp of its current share repurchase authorization. We
also think HIG has a greater ability to return capital relative to its peers who hold rating
agency capital at a higher benchmark. HIG's financial plan is ambitious given some
dependence on tailwinds, even so, our estimate updates are getting closer to HIG's
targets given our growing conviction on management execution.

Workers Compensation - Positive Rate Contributor (+1%): HIG signaled it will learn
more in the next 30-60 days how bureaus will treat 2020 pandemic trends on 2022 loss
cost filings (see link: NCCI). Outside viewing a pandemic as catastrophe-like, the big
debate is how regulators will perceive last year's WC frequency tailwind as it formulates
indicated rate needs.

Why Overweight? HIG has sound fundamentals
following transformation which should cont. to drive
a stronger book multiple. ROE convergence with
peers should make current valuation look
inexpensive. Navigators acquisition is becoming more
accretive given boost from hard pricing in specialty
lines. HIG has accelerated the pace of its expense
savings plans.
Upside case
USD 80.00
Our upside case of $80 reflects stronger than
expected underwriting margin expansion and
commercial P&C pricing levels. $80 reflects the
weighted average of ~12x '22E EPS.
Downside case
USD 52.00
Our downside case of $52 assumes unsuccessful
underwriting margin expansion and expense savings
as well as slowdown in the commercial P&C renewal
rate environment. $52 reflects the weighted average
of ~8x '22E EPS.

Growth & Margin Expansion
We are not seeing a consistent story with rates; standard commercial rate increased 4% in
2Q21, up from 3.6% in 1Q21 yet down from 4.2% in 4Q20. HIG's small commercial workers
compensation pricing was directionally more positive this quarter. On an ex-WC basis, we
can better see the rate moderation trend. Besides WC, NPW growth was most evident in
small commercial package business (benefit from next gen Spectrum product), general
liability, U.S. wholesale, U.S. financial lines and global reinsurance. See Figure 1 for rate
trend.
PIF retention rates were mixed with Middle markets retention creeping up to 82% in 2Q21,
from 80% in 1Q21, and 77% in 4Q20. Alternatively, small commercial retention has levelled
off to 86% in both 2Q21 and 1Q21, from 84% in 4Q20.

Workers Compensation - Positive Rate Contributor (+1%): HIG signalled it will learn more
in the next 30-60 days how bureaus will treat 2020 pandemic trends on 2022 loss cost
filings (see link: NCCI). Our read is that COVID-19 will be treated as a catastrophe and
excluded from underlying loss cost trends from Nov 21-Aug 22. NCCI also separately
announced lower COVID-19 related claims than expectations. NCCI was silent on how they
would treat the WC frequency tailwind in 2020.

P&C premiums growth in commercial lines better than expected
P&C net written premiums were $3,254mn (12.1% y/y) vs. our estimate of $3,017mn
(+4%) on higher than expected commercial ($2,494mn vs. our estimate of $2,263mn) and
personal ($760mn vs. our estimate of $754mn). Middle markets retention is creeping up to
82% in 2Q21, from 80% in 1Q21, and 77% in 4Q20. Likewise, small commercial retention
has leveled off to 86% in both 2Q21 and 1Q21, from 84% in 4Q20.
· SME Market: Standard or E&S starting point? The key debate is as new businesses
open up will these new businesses need to shop at the E&S market for a couple of years
before making their way into the standard market? Therefore, could there may be a
lagged growth effect for SME writers? HIG commented that it has an E&S platform from
Navigators to take advantage of E&S like new business at the smaller end of the market
or may have capabilities on its own platform.
. PIF growth in personal lines - on the margin: We think HIG's ongoing rollout of its
personal lines auto and home product is worth watching, though early contributions
may be on the margin. The products are now available in Arizona and Illinois with 7
additional states coming online by year-end. The 10-year extension (details here) of the
auto and home insurance program between HIG and AARP positioned HIG to make a
long-term investment in modernizing product and improving user experience in a
growing demographic. PIF growth directly stemming from the product modernization
isn't likely to materialize until beyond 2022 when the product is more broadly rolled out
across the country.
Auto Lost Trends - Noticeable Frequency Uptick Silent on Severity
Underlying Personal Lines loss ratio increased by 9.3 point to 60.6%. HIG attributes 6.2pts
on its loss ratio to higher auto frequency trends. Higher building costs on the homeowners
side contributed 2.7 points on the loss ratio.

Vehicle miles driven (Figure 2) is approaching pre-pandemic levels, an indicator of auto
frequency trends. Quarter to date, we have evidence from PGR (June '21: Harder Pricing in
Sight?, 7/15/21), TRV (2Q21 Review: Dissecting Loss Trends, 7/20/21) and now HIG of
elevated underlying auto loss ratios. We expect HIG's personal lines underlying loss ratio to
revert to the mid-60s, which is in line with pre-pandemic historical trend.

HIG's senior demographic might be more insulated than the general population from higher
auto frequency trends based on historical miles driven by age group (Figure 3). (Less driving
like going to Church, grocery store, etc.). HIG was silent on auto severity experience while
others acknowledged it was taking a toll post pandemic. It may be tougher to ask a senior
to pay more for auto insurance. If the industry is beginning to raise auto rates, would HIG
lag behind as it did the last time we saw auto rate hardening in 2015-2017.

Group Benefits - Turning a Corner?
Group benefits business was a positive contributor to earnings in 2Q, a nice reprise from its
1Q21 drag. Group benefits core margin of 9.5% trended higher than management's '21
range of 3.7-4.7%, (including COVID) and 6-7% range (ex-COVID). HIG is still seeing excess
mortality from younger claimants with higher face values (MET said this in 1Q) but is
benefiting from favorable disability and elevated NII. We had expected lower excess
mortality and short-term disability, but the quarter's results beat our expectations with a
71.4% loss ratio relative to our 78.5% estimates.
Boy Scout Association
In the 10Q, HIG mentioned that it thinks $650mn is the right number but there are risks.
There is a lot riding on HIG approaching its ambitious 13-14% ROE target by 2022-2023.
With less BSA finality, future capital needs could impede HIG's $2.5bn buyback goalpost,
which we view was partly a defense measure to a takeout story. Even so, we think it could
take years for the industry to come to terms with the ultimate BSA insurable payout.
Our Take on HIG's Financial Target Plan
Financial plan is ambitious given some dependence on tailwinds: Key tenets include the
worse of COVID-19 in the rear view mirror, near-term economic recovery including rapidly
improving unemployment rates that will disproportionately benefit small businesses, rising
interest rates and continued P&C price firming. Even so, our estimate updates are getting
closer to HIG's financial targets given our growing conviction on management execution.
Our ROE outlook is 12.9% (+30bps) in '22 and 13.3% (+10bps) in '23, compared to
management's target of 13-14% in 2022 and 2023.
We got a few nuggets of information on HIG's forward looking performance relative to its
financial plan on the 2Q21 earnings call:
· COVID-19 related claims evolving; excess mortality should continue improving
through remainder of 2021: Excess mortality primarily caused by direct and indirect
impacts from COVID-19 claims fell in 2Q vs. 1Q. Worth noting is that as the pandemic
has evolved, so has the average age of its COVID-19 claimants - younger age cohorts
being impacted carry higher face amounts and have increased HIG's average COVID-19
claim severity relative to earlier periods in the pandemic. Variant strains and the
unvaccinated particularly among younger age cohorts remain COVID-19 related risks
worth monitoring on the path back to normalcy.
. Commercial Lines top line growth target reiterated but 3Q and 4Q won't look like
2Q21: We're modelling ~4.5% y/y net written premium growth per quarter from 3Q21-
4Q22. Worth noting that HIG has grown more bullish since 1Q on its 4-5% written
premium multi-year CAGR target in commercial lines through 2022. We don't expect
2Q21 growth to repeat in 3Q or 4Q, but this is primarily related to 2Q20 being a weak
comp and GDP growth moderation.
· Hartford Next plan tracking: No change to expected expense savings targets (below).
We expect expense savings coming from its Hartford Next Plan to drive the P&C
expense ratio slightly below 30% by YE22.
2021E: $390mn (current)
- 2022E: $540mn (current)
- 2023E: $625mn (current)
29 July 2021

Barclays | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
We still seek more clarity where expense savings are coming from with the Hartford
Next plan vs. lower operating costs recognized during shelter in place.
· Capital deployment - our view of timing: We expect HIG's $2.5bn repurchase
authorization to be more heavily weighted toward the near term with $1.5bn in 2021
and $1.0bn in 2022. HIG has ~$1.7bn remaining after repurchasing $116mn from July 1,
2021 through July 27, 2021. Funding buybacks is a combination of holding company
resources of $1.7bn as of June 30, 2021. HIG expects subsidiary dividends to range from
$725mn to $900mn during the 2nd half of 2021.

Model Updates: Our key model updates include higher near-term premium growth, steeper
personal lines loss ratios (albeit still showing improvement from 2019) and somewhat
better group benefits loss ratio performance. HIG's higher buyback activity in 2Q relative to
our expectations resulted in us lowering our buyback assumptions in 3Q21 and 4Q21, but
the cumulative sum of $2.5bn has not changed.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $73 price target for HIG reflects a 50/50 weighting of 11.2x '22 EPS of $6.77 and 1.3x '22 P/B ex AOCI of $54.5.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.
