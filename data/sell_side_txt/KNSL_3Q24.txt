Post 3Q24 Follow Up: Trimming EPS and Price Target,
Neutral
We are reducing our EPS estimates and price target for KNSL, from $420 to
$415. Our Neutral rating is unchanged. Kinsale reported 3Q24 earnings on
10/24/2024 and hosted a conference call the following day, on 10/25/2024.
· Reducing EPS estimates. We are trimming EPS modestly (4Q24: $4.62 to
$4.45, 2025: $18.97 to $18.71, 2026: from $22.54 to $22.28). Our updated
model incorporates (1) $7.5 million of Milton losses in 4Q24, partly offset by
a better attritional loss ratio (KNSL expects Milton losses of $10 million or
below), (2) a lower premium growth curve (21%, 17%, and 14% in 2024, 2025,
and 2026 versus 24%, 20%, and 14% previously), (3) higher investment
income, and (4) share buybacks of $20 million a year beginning in 1Q25
(KNSL announced a $100 million open-ended buyback program along with
3Q24 results). Our underwriting margin assumptions for 2025 and subsequent
periods are largely unchanged. Consistent with past practice, we expect to
arrive at a more refined review of 4Q24 gross written premiums towards the
end of December using reporting from state stamping offices and 3Q24
statutory premium data, which gives a breakdown of casualty and property
business.
· Premium growth disappointed this quarter, but underwriting results were
a meaningful offset. Gross premium written (GPW) growth was +19%, below
consensus of +22% (range of +20-26%), and our estimate of +24%. Although
the specific drivers of this outcome (premiums by state and product line) won't
be available until KNSL publishes 3Q24 statutory data, management noted that
greater competition in certain lines (large account commercial property,
professional liability, product liability) led to softer overall growth. In other
lines such as general casualty, excess casualty, small account commercial
property, and high value homeowners', growth remains strong. Based on our
initial read of stamping office data, GPW growth this quarter would imply
weakness in California and other states as we estimate that GPW growth was
~25% in TX and FL. On a positive note, management noted that submission
growth of +23% accelerated from the second quarter, implying that the top of
the funnel for KNSL remains robust and that slower growth is likely from a
combination of price moderation (nominal price hikes of 3% in 3Q24 versus
6% in 2Q24) and lower quoting and/or binding ratios. Despite the shortfall in
premiums, underwriting results were a bigger offset, with attritional losses,
reserve releases, and expenses coming in better than expected.
.Morgan
· Our view is that given where KNSL's results are running today, downside
risk from softer growth has less of a tail than before. KNSL's current growth
trajectory (high-teens to low-20s GPW growth in the past two quarters) is much
closer to the mid-teens long-run growth trajectory management believes the
business can grow at, and so our view is that potential downside will be less
compared to when KNSL was growing +45% and investors were grappling
with what KNSL's growth curve would look like as it moves from above-

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly
traded P&C insurer that operates exclusively in the E&S
insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts.
Our long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large
addressable market, superior technology platform, and low cost
base, which we view as a sustainable competitive advantage.
Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are
concerned about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C
pricing cycle moderates.

normal to long-term growth. Also, KNSL has a share buyback program in place - which
can be used more opportunistically if warranted by the stock price. Lastly, the lower
magnitude of potential growth downside can be more easily offset by upside in
underwriting margins, and at more "normal" levels of growth, we think that KNSL's
actions to trade off margins and growth (i.e. KNSL pricing below others for certain pieces
of business because of its expense advantage) can be more impactful.
· 3Q24 summary: earnings better, with lower premiums more than offset by margins.
3Q24 operating EPS was $4.20, above our $4.01 estimate and consensus of $3.62.
Underwriting income was better than our model (+$0.19 per share after taxes), with lower
attritional claims (+$0.33), higher favorable development (+$0.03), higher fee income
(+$0.02), and lower expenses (+$0.19) more than offsetting a shortfall in earned
premiums (-$0.30) and higher catastrophe losses (-$0.08). Net investment income came
in above our estimate (+$0.03 per share after tax). Gross written premiums (GPW) rose
+18.8% to $448.6 million, below our +24.0% estimate ($468.5 million) and consensus
of +22.3% ($462.2 million). Meanwhile, KNSL's combined ratio in 3Q24 was 75.7%,
better than our 77.8% estimate and consensus of 80.8%. On a core basis, underwriting
margins were also healthy (CR ex. cats and PYD 74.7% vs. 77.2%E).
· We are Neutral. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates exclusively
in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our long-term
outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior technology
platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive advantage. Still,
the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned about the risk of
multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates. Having said this, if KNSL's
near-term growth trajectory comes in above our expectations, we could become more
constructive on the stock.

Investment Thesis
KNSL held its earnings conference call on
October 25, 2024. The call replay is
available on https://
ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We remain Neutral. Overall, we expect KNSL's premiums and margins to benefit from
favorable trends in the E&S market, which continues to generate healthy growth at
attractive pricing/terms even after several years of above-trend growth. Despite more
stable conditions in 2024 (i.e. less of a positive delta than in 2023), the property market
remains compelling and KNSL intends to grow the relative size of this business (~30%
of premiums in 2023) while controlling its exposure to property catastrophe risk. In the
meantime, casualty pricing could experience another uptick as more insurers recognize
adverse development. Independent of the market environment, we think that Kinsale's
low-cost operating model is a sustainable competitive advantage, especially against
higher cost insurers like Lloyd's writers. During periods of softer pricing, KNSL's lower
expense ratio will allow it to be more competitive on pricing while still generating
above-average growth and margins. We remain Neutral on the stock, however, as we
think its valuation is full compared to commercial peers and specialist names even after
giving credit to KNSL's growth potential and above-average margins. Further, while
favorable P&C market conditions are likely to persist through 2024 and early 2025 and
will have positive implications for KNSL's reserves and future earnings, the eventual
turn in the P&C pricing cycle is a downside risk to the stock's above-average multiple.
Less favorable development on older accident years could also decrease the quantum of
future reserve releases. Having said this, if KNSL's near-term growth trajectory comes
in better than our expectations, we could become more upbeat on the stock.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
In our view, the E&S market - where KNSL operates exclusively - will eventually see
moderating new business volumes and price hikes as more underwriters focus on growth
(a negative for pricing) and admitted markets increase their appetite for risk (recapturing
business from E&S). We also expect retail brokers to eventually divert business back to
admitted markets to recapture the economics they are sharing with wholesalers. Still,
our view is that KNSL can continue to grow premiums at a healthy pace given its small
base and the fragmented pricing cycle whereby certain lines are seeing pricing
deceleration (property excluding high value homeowners') and others could potentially
see another upward inflection (casualty). With respect to profitability, our view is that
the combination of price hikes and conservative reserving will support healthy margins
at KNSL for the foreseeable future. However, we think that reserve releases will
diminish in the near term given that more mature accident years (2015-2019) are likely
to have less redundancy than before, and that more recent accident years (2020 and
onwards) - where presumably embedded margins are thicker - are still un-seasoned.
Also, to the extent that the gap between nominal pricing and loss trends continue to
narrow, there is less scope for KNSL to report improving attritional loss ratios.
Low Cost Base a Sustainable Competitive Advantage
KNSL has a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform built from ground up -
in contrast to peers that use unwieldy systems built off legacy and newer technologies -
which allows it to handle significant business volumes without sacrificing customer
responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense efficiency. As a result, KNSL
maintains an industry leading expense ratio, and we expect it to outperform higher cost
competitors through the pricing cycle. During softer markets, KNSL can grow
premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-average profitability, and in hard

markets, Kinsale can be a price taker and generate excess returns.
KNSL is in the process of updating its technology platform towards a "target state" with
more modular architecture and where insured data can be accessed across multiple
applications simultaneously. Management expects these upgrades to deliver cost
efficiencies, incremental revenues, and analytical capabilities. The amount of funding
for this initiative was not sized by Kinsale, but management noted that it should be fully
absorbed in the current run-rate expense ratio.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle Is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect price hikes to
eventually moderate as re/insurers re-position themselves for growth. Given this, we see
multiple compression as a risk since pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in
E&S because of its function as a safety valve for the market. Although we think some
portion of E&S share gains is permanent and that KNSL will thrive even if prices
soften, a reasonable valuation analysis will have to look several years out because of
KNSL's above-average growth profile and would thus have to account for conditions in
the market at that time.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale (Neutral; Price Target: $415.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our
long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior
technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are lowering our December 2025 price target from $420 to $415 to reflect lower EPS
estimates. Our price target assumes a x multiple on 2026E BV and an 18.5x multiple on
2026E operating income. These target multiples are well above peers', which we think is
supported by KNSL's above-average premium growth (mid-teens growth versus mid- to
high-single-digit growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile (high 70s to
low 80s CR versus 85-90% for peers). KNSL trades at 6.8x BV, well above specialty peers
(ex. PLMR) of 2.6x and commercial peers at 1.9x. On 2025E earnings, KNSL trades at 22x
versus 14x for specialty insurers (ex. PLMR) and 11x for commercial insurers.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher prices and
greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If current conditions
persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our forecasts and investor
sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We would
expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds growth
expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving could lead to
margin improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin improvement tracks
higher than expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push-back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market, and clients are
pushing back more strongly on price hikes, while more insurers are deploying capital
and positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to turn, there is a risk of
multiple compression for insurers that have seen an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation reemerge in casualty reserves. Although
unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and low limits, the
reopening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up liability claims.
· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has a
strong underwriting track record, and it is entering new lines in a strong part of the cycle.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
Coverage Universe: Singzon, Pablo S: Bowhead (BOW), Fidelis Insurance (FIHL), Goosehead (GSHD), Hagerty (HGTY), Kinsale (KNSL),
Palomar (PLMR), TWFG Insurance (TWFG), The Baldwin Group (BWIN)
