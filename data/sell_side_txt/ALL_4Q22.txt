4Q Review: Severity Iterations
ALL is not only increasing full year severities from claims
occurring in prior quarters, it is reshuffling BI PYD by AY.
Incremental views on ALL post 4Q earnings. We anticipate ALL's remediation path to be a long
one.
1. Spike in underlying combined ratio is >100% across a number of states (41 states in 4Q22,
28 states in 3Q22, 23 states in 2Q22 and 15 states in 1Q22). According to our conversation with
the CFO, part of this spike was in part driven by ALL's inter-quarter re-estimates taken
throughout the year. Therefore, we would have like to seen a 2022 vs. 2021 comparison which
would normalize some of that noise. ALL is imposing increased underwriting restrictions in 37
states including CA, NY and NJ.

2. Iterations to severity loss trend, especially BI. ALL is talking up bodily injury and attorney
representation adverse trends more than others leading to higher bodily injury loss trend
commentary vs. peers (see figure 3), from 8% in 1Q22, 9% in YTD 2Q22, 12% in YTD 3Q22 and
14% FY2022. ALL's physical damage (severity) loss trends notably lags PGR during YTD3Q22 (see
figure 2). To recap, ALL's inter-year loss picks have also increased reflecting ALL's iterative views
on BI (up from 8% in 1Q22 to 14% in YTD3Q22) and physical damage (up from 11% in 1Q22 to
17% in FY2022). ALL increased claim severity in 4Q for bodily injury and physical damage for the
full year 2022 to reflect continued increases in loss costs.

3. Bodily Injury PYD: Evolving Views by Accident Year
Reshuffling Act: In 4Q22 vs. 3Q22, ALL had reshuffled by AY where to reflect higher BI PYD and
did not change the aggregate charge. In doing so AY21 now represents 24% of the BI PYD
charges up from 6% in Sept. '22, which we thought was too low to begin with. Still, we are less
clear why only one quarter later we are seeing this reshuffling act.

4. 103.9% is the more accurate 4Q22 auto underlying combined ratio, removing the effects
of prior quarter re-estimates. During 2022, ALL made several re-estimates to its prior quarter
auto underlying loss ratio, obscuring what the true metric in the corresponding reporting period
should look like. In figure 6, we outline ALL's auto underlying combined ratio adjusted for these
inter quarter estimates to better depict its quarterly trend.

5. Claims Process Revamp: Reduced the volume of pending bodily injury claims by ~20%.
Pending BI claims in aggregate is at its lowest level since pre-2016 as it settling claims quicker to
avoid inflationary risk. We understand that previously, ALL required medical documentation for
even benign injury claims like $250. That delay drove up the ultimate claim amount as these
claimants just went to more doctor visits. Now ALL just wants to get these claims over with. On
the PD side, ALL is reducing cycle time around storage and car rentals.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
ALL's fundamentals are strong and
we look forward to seeing progress
on its transformative growth plan.
However, pricing correction actions
may stall ALL's progress in
actualizing stronger PIF growth.
Upside case
USD 150.00
Loss cost trends abate, returning to
2019 baseline levels. Successful
execution of Allstate's
transformational growth plans via
efficiency gains that is translated to
strong PIF growth, particularly in
auto. Our upside case of $150
assumes ~2.1x our '24 BVPS ex AOCI
estimate.
Downside case
USD 118.00
Steeper acceleration of loss cost
trends, particularly on the severity
side. Prolonged period of achieving
approvals from regulators with
respect to requested rate increases.
Our downside case of $118 assumes
~11x our '24 EPS estimates.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life
AIG, Inc. (AIG)
Chubb Limited (CB)
Palomar Holdings, Inc. (PLMR)

*This is the closing price referenced in the publication, which may not be
the last available closing price at the time of publication.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within
the next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or
an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $125 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended ~11.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.7x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.
