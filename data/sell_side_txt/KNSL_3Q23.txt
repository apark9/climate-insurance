3Q23 Earnings: Premium Growth Slower, But Overall
Results Still Strong
KNSL's 3Q23 print featured robust margins and lower than expected but still
healthy premium growth. In our view, Kinsale has proven itself to be a high-quality
E&S operator, but we are reluctant to chase the stock at these levels (despite the
potential for the already extended hard P&C market to persist) and remain Neutral.
· EPS upside. 3Q23 operating EPS was $3.31, well above our and consensus
estimates of $2.84. Underwriting income was better (+$0.60 favorable
variance), with robust underwriting margins (+$1.21) more than offsetting
lower than expected net earned premiums (-$0.62). Investment income was a
touch higher (+$0.03). Compared to our model, the shortfall in premiums was
due to lower gross written premium growth (+33.0% vs. our+45.0% estimate,
+58.2% in 2Q23, and +43.8% in 3Q22) and a lower premium retention ratio
(retention ratio of 77.9% vs. 82.0%E). We raised forward EPS estimates
modestly nonetheless, as we expect lower premium growth (mostly from lower
retentions) to be more than offset by better underwriting margins.
· Updated reinsurance program impacted retention ratios, unclear from
disclosure what drove the deceleration in gross premium growth. We had
modelled some decrease in the retention ratio (from 85% in 2022 and 84% in
1H23 to 82% in 3Q23) but the impact of higher cessions under KNSL's
commercial property and excess casualty quota share programs was larger than
assumed. With respect to gross premium growth in 3Q23, +33% is still
exceptional compared to peers, but it is slower than KNSL's growth in recent
years (+42% in 2020, +38% in 2021, +44% in 2022, +52% in 1H23). We expect
management to address this topic on the call tomorrow as a number of factors
could have contributed to this result - business shifting across quarters, policies
from 3Q22 non-renewing, a change in the mix of business, and so on.
· Underwriting margins were robust. KNSL's combined ratio in 3Q23 was
74.9%, significantly better than our 81.2% estimate, with most of the positive
variance attributable to lower catastrophes (0.4% vs. 4.6%E) and to a lesser
extent, higher favorable development (-3.2% vs. - 2.9%E). The core combined
ratio (77.6% vs. 79.5%E) was also healthy, with both the attritional loss ratio
(56.7% vs. 57.7%E) and the expense ratio (20.9% vs. 21.8%E) coming in
better. We expect continued margin improvement for KNSL - although
potentially at a slower pace than previously - given the positive spread between
pricing and loss trends in the casualty book and the growing share of property
business, which tends to have lower loss ratios.

· Miscellaneous items from 3Q23. (1) Despite the decline in KNSL's portfolio
duration (2.9 in 3Q23 vs. 3.1 in 2Q23 and 3.5 in 3Q22), the portfolio yield
increased. (2) No change in favorable commentary about submission activity
and pricing. (3) Average written premiums per policy were $15,500 in 3Q23,
up 7% from $14,700 in 3Q22, but slower than +18% growth in 1H23. (4)
Reserve releases driven by most lines in AY 2021-22, partly offset by property
claims within construction casualty business from AY 2017-19.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded
P&C insurer that operates exclusively in the E&S insurance
market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our long-
term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable
market, superior technology platform, and low cost base, which
we view as a sustainable competitive advantage. Still, the stock's
valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle
moderates.

Investment Thesis
Please see Page 5 for tables
summarizing 3Q23 results. KNSL will
hold its earnings conference call at 9:00
AM Eastern on October 27, 2023. The
dial-in number for the call is 888-660-
6493; code: 3573726. The call replay will
be available on https://
ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We remain Neutral. We expect KNSL's premium growth and margins to benefit from
favorable trends in the E&S market, which continues to generate outsized growth at
attractive pricing/terms. The property insurance market is especially compelling, and
KNSL intends to grow the relative size of this business (20% of premiums in 2022)
while controlling its exposure to property catastrophe risk. In addition, we think that
Kinsale's low-cost operating model is a sustainable competitive advantage across the
pricing cycle, especially against higher cost competitors like Lloyd's writers. Still, we
choose to stay Neutral on the stock because our view is that its valuation is full
compared to commercial peers and specialist names even after giving credit to KNSL's
growth potential and above-average margins. Furthermore, while favorable P&C market
conditions are likely to persist in the near term and will have positive implications for
KNSL's reserves and future earnings, the eventual turn in the P&C pricing cycle is a
downside risk to the stock's above-average multiple.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
In our view, the E&S market - where KNSL operates exclusively - will eventually see
moderating new business volumes and price hikes as more underwriters focus on growth
(weighing on pricing) and admitted markets increase their appetite for risk (recapturing
business that had been diverted to E&S). Another factor that will shift business back to
admitted markets will be retail brokers trying to recapture some of the business they are
now sharing with their wholesale counterparts. Nevertheless, our view is that KNSL can
continue to grow premiums at a healthy pace given its small base and the fragmented
pricing cycle whereby certain lines (property, marine) are only beginning to benefit
from harder prices despite a slowdown in other lines. With respect to profitability, our
view is that combination of price hikes - historical and prospective - and conservative
reserving will support healthy margins at KNSL for the foreseeable future.
Low Cost Base a Sustainable Competitive Advantage
KNSL has a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform built from ground up -
in contrast to peers that use unwieldy hybrid systems consisting of legacy platforms and
newer technologies - which allows it to handle significant business volumes without
sacrificing customer responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense efficiency. As a
result, KNSL maintains an industry leading expense ratio, and we expect it to
outperform higher cost competitors (especially Lloyd's which is more than 20% of the
E&S market) through the pricing cycle. During softer markets, KNSL can grow
premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-average profitability. In hard
markets, Kinsale can be a price taker and generate an even larger excess return.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect price hikes to
eventually moderate as re/insurers re-position themselves for growth (property coverage
likely to be the exception in the near term). Given this, we see multiple compression as a
risk since pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in E&S because of its function
as a safety valve for the market. Although we think some portion of E&S share gains are
permanent and that KNSL will thrive even if prices soften, a reasonable valuation
analysis will have to look several years out because of KNSL's above-average growth
profile and would thus have to account for conditions in the market at that time.

Increasing EPS Estimates
We are increasing 4Q23 EPS from $3.37 to $3.44 and 2024 EPS from $15.45 to $15.67.
Our model assumes lower premium growth in future periods (lower retention ratio, no
change in gross premium growth assumptions), more than offset by better underwriting
margins and higher investment income. As we have said on several occasions, we think
KNSL is more likely than not to continue surprising to the upside given the positive
momentum underpinning its premium growth, underwriting margins, and investment
income. However, our concern is that even after giving credit for most of these factors,
KNSL still trades at a significant premium versus peers. Additionally, even if KNSL's
stock could justifiably trade at a permanent (albeit lower) premium for structural reasons
(high quality franchise, above-average growth, pricing advantage), we think its current
valuation multiple has an embedded benefit from the favorable P&C environment,
which is not permanent and will eventually deteriorate.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale (Neutral; Price Target: $375.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our
long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior
technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2024 price target from $370 to $375 given our higher EPS
estimates. Our price target assumes a 5x multiple on 2025 book value and a 19x multiple
on 2025 operating income. These target multiples are well above peers', which we think is
supported by KNSL's above-average premium growth (long-term low- to mid-teens growth
versus mid- to high-single-digit growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile
(high 70s to low 80s CR versus 85-90% for peers). KNSL trades at 10.7x BV, well above
specialty peers (ex. PLMR) of 2.2x and commercial peers at 1.5x. On 2024E earnings,
KNSL trades at 27x versus 12x for specialty insurers and 9x for commercial insurers.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher prices and
greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If current conditions
persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our forecasts and investor
sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We would
expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds growth
expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving suggests margin
improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin improvement tracks higher than
expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are pushing
back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are deploying capital and
positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to turn, there is a risk of multiple
compression for insurers that have seen an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation reemerge in casualty reserves. Although
unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and low limits, the
reopening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up liability claims.
· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has a
strong underwriting track record, and it is entering new lines in a strong part of the cycle.

Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage, the impact of badly underwritten
risks is likely to persist. Also, inflation is a risk for both casualty and property coverages.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average
total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this
stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Underweight
[Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the
analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country
market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying
analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
