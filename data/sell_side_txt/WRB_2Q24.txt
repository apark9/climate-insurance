Price Target Change - July 22, 2024
Commercial Lines Insurance
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Charging More; Q2 Earnings and Conference Call Roundup
Our Call
WRB shares should trade up given weakness post TRV combined with Berkley seeing
minimal reserve movement ($1m overall releases with $2.5m of releases in insurance) and
a better-than-expected AY loss ratio vs consensus (59.4% vs. consensus of 59.6%).
Estimate and price target changes: Our 2024 EPS estimate is unchanged at $4.00 as
the Q2 beat was offset by weaker rest of year underlying margins and a higher tax rate.
Our 2025 and 2026 estimates go down to $4.25 and $4.70 (from $4.30 and $4.80),
respectively, reflecting a higher tax rate and weaker underlying margins, partially offset by
higher NII. Our price target is now $59 (from $62) based on 14.0x our 2025 EPS estimate.
Takes for the group: (1) Social inflation continues to wane on liability lines, with a
heightened impact on commercial auto; (2) rate ex comp was up 50bps sequentially vs
Q1 (to 8.3%) and was noted as being ahead of loss trend; (3) E&S continues to see robust
flow given discrepancy between rate and loss cost trends on the admitted side; and (4)
WRB upped their current loss picks relative to Q1 given uncertainty surrounding inflation
(especially with commercial auto).
Conservatism in current AY: WRB will remain conservative with loss picks and are not
dropping picks with respect to the unknown and ongoing impact of social inflation. The
insurance accident year was up 30bps vs Q1 (flat Y/Y although last year saw elevated fire
losses) with the uptick from auto as well as it how it spreads to other lines (like umbrella).
On reserves, there was $2.5m of releases in insurance, with reinsurance strengthening by
$1.5m (not much color was provided beyond this).
Argentine securities color and guidance: Argentine inflation-linked securities added
$63m to investment income, which was toward the high-end of the guided $45-65m. The
company noted they expect $20-30m of investment income related to these securities
over the next few quarters. They did note that of the $63m, there was $50m of foreign
currency losses, which led to a net $13m good guy in the quarter. Going forward, the
expected $20-30m investment income should also be offset by FX like in Q2.
Other conference call highlights: They reiterated confidence the expense ratio should
be still comfortably below 30% in 2024 and that they can continue grow premiums by
10-15%. They pointed to a higher tax rate this year (23.7% in Q2) in the balance of the
year (and beyond) given changes in revenue geographic mix. WRB should grow NII Q/Q for
the foreseeable future as they reinvest at higher rates (5.0-5.25% new money rate versus
4.5% book yield). See inside for highlights of key issues for WRB.

Base Case | $59.00
. Our price target of $59 is based on just
around a 2.3x multiple of our year-end
2025 book value estimate
· Our price target also represents a
~14.0x multiple against our 2025 EPS
estimate.
. The 14.0x is a slight discount to where
WRB has historically traded as we
look to be conservative given social
inflation impacting both current and
prior accident years.
Upside Scenario | $77.00
· In the upside scenario we use a multiple
of 3.0x 2025 book value, close to peak
valuation levels.
. We assume WRB is able to see
consistent double-digit premium
growth, margin expansion and good
investment returns resulting in industry
leading returns.
· Assumes lack of significant adverse
reserve development.
Downside Scenario | $42.00
· In the downside scenario we use a
multiple of 10.0x 2025 EPS (which
translates into 1.7x book value) and is
below trough levels (although those
multiples were in lower interest rate
environments).
. In this scenario WRB could see lower
premium growth, margin compression
and volatility within its investment
returns.
· The downside scenario includes volatility
within its reserves and further adverse
development on the softer market years
or large adverse development on more
recent accident years
Upcoming Catalysts
· Monthly pricing surveys, which will highlight the overall
strength (or lack thereof) of the commercial lines pricing
environment
. The filing of its 10Q, which should provide more color on the
reserve movement within the insurance segment in Q2

Q2 Earnings Highlights
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q2 EPS of $1.04, beating our $0.97 and consensus of $0.92. The upside
was due to higher investment income (investment income came in at $372.1m, higher than our
$343.6m), and higher than expected favorable PYD (0.1 pts favorable vs our est. of 0.1 pts adverse).
Cat losses came in at $89.7m (3.2 pts), higher than our $78m (2.7 pts). Prior year favorable reserve
development was $1m (adding 0.1 points), relative to estimate for $3m of adverse development
(0.1 pts) with $2.5m of favorable development in insurance offset by $1.5m of adverse development
within reinsurance. The investment income beat vs us was driven by higher core portfolio income of
$330m vs our $314m and higher investment funds income of $25.5m (6.5% return) vs our estimate
of $11.8m (3% return). Within the core portfolio about half the upside was from Argentinian inflation
linked securities. The Argentinian inflation linked securities added $63m (high end of expected
$45-65m) and above our $55 million (although there was $50m of FX losses associated with the gain
that offset the majority).
The underlying combined ratio of 88.0% was above our 87.4%; the underlying loss ratio came in 10bps
worse than us and was 10 basis points better than last Q2. The expense ratio was 28.5%, 40 basis
points higher than us. WRB bought back $223.8m of shares, relative to our $50m, and returned
an additional $157m through dividends (included a special dividend) for a payout ratio of 91%. The
average diluted share count of 403.7m was less than our 404.9m estimate. The operating ROE was
21.5%, and the net income ROE was 20.0%. Book value per share grew by 1.0% sequentially to $20.42.

What the Companies Are Saying - WRB
Outlook
The only move in the underlying loss ratio was in auto, where they are trying to stay on top of trend.
They also said they took a look at how auto feeds into the umbrella line. On the expense side, there
are new businesses in the infancy that are now incorporated in the segments and until there is a
critical mass, there will be a bit of drag. In addition, they are making some pretty chunky investments
on the tech and data and analytics front. The company is confident in their reserve position as they
highlighted their low paid loss ratio which continues to run in the mid-40s and their IBNR relative
to net earned premium is in the 37.5% to 39% range for AYs 2020 - 2023 while it was between
31-34% when looking at the 2016 - 2019 period. The company said the CrowdStrike issue will hit
some business interruption policies, but they do not envision this being something that is materially
consequential.
Pricing
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8.3% in Q2, higher than 7.8% in Q1 primarily due to
commercial auto. The overall rate remains on top of loss trend. The company noted there are many
insurance departments that are not operating in a timely manner and allowing the rate needed for
admitted carriers, which is pushing business into the specialty and E&S side.
Guidance
WRB does not provide much in the way of guidance. They remained confident in achieve premium
growth between 10 and 15%, although they did caveat some quarters may be below or above the
range. They have said that the expense ratio should be comfortably below 30%. Argentine inflation-
linked securities should provide $20-30m of income per quarter for the next few quarters (although
like we saw in Q2 it will be offset to some extent by FX losses). The effective tax rate will likely remain
at the Q2 23.7% through the remainder of the year due to the contribution of foreign earnings taxed
at rates greater than U.S. stat rate of 21%.
Investments
Net investment income was $330m in Q2, above $319.8m in Q1, and benefited from Argentinian
inflation-adjusted securities, which added $63m (the high-end of the $45-65m guide) and relative
to $96m in Q1. These securities should add $20-30m of income in the near-term over the next few
quarters. While investment income saw $63m of earnings this was offset by $50m of FX losses result
in a net income impact of $13m and WRB expects the FX impact to largely offset the investment
income on an overall impact going forward. The duration of the portfolio was unchanged at 2.5 years,
but was up modestly when compared to 2.4 years at year-end 2023. The yield on the portfolio was
4.5%, relative to current market yield of close to 5.25%. Investment income is expected to growth
on a year-over-year basis for the foreseeable future. The company noted from their perspective
alternatives are not really a great interest to them given where interest rates are and will continue to
lean more on the fixed income market.
Liquidity and Capital
WRB's debt to capital ratio ended Q2 at 26.7%, which is stable with the end of the Q1 and below the
YE 2023 level of 27.6%. There were $224m of repurchases in the quarter after no repurchases in the
prior quarter (there was also a $127m special dividend and $30m of regular dividends). In the past
WRB has used both share repurchase and special dividends as a way to return excess capital ;. The
company's payout ratio was 91.2%, relative to 6.7% in the Q1, 67.3% in the Q4 (incl. special dividends),
44% in Q3 and over 100% in the Q2 and Q1 last year.
WRB's call focused on pricing,
reserves, loss trend and
investment income.
WRB's guidance included:
(1) expense ratio should be
comfortably below 30%,
(2) premium growth in the
10-15% range, (3) Argentinian
inflation securities should add
a normalized level of $20-30
million of operating income, and
(4) the tax rate will likely remain
at the Q2 23.7% through the
remainder of the year.

Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period Pricing Comments
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8.3%, which was above the 7.8% in the prior quarter. When asked about the
sequential acceleration, the company highlighted commercial auto as the leading candidate for the uptick given the line grew
almost 16%, which is being driven by higher rate. For the current year, the company noted they are building in a risk margin
that they feel is reasonably comfortable. The company highlighted that they have received 68% cumulative rate ex comp since
2019 with loss trend cumulative uptick below that. The company noted that professional liability ex D&O) is having a
reasonably good moment on both the admitted and non-admitted side while D&O continues to be challenged, specifically
transactional liability is very concerning and they are shrinking the line rapidly. WRB said there are many insurance
departments not operating in a timely manner and in some cases quite resistant to allows carriers on the commercial side to get!
rate increases they neeed which is pushing business into the specialty and E&S market. The company pointed out that the E&S!
business is probably gorwing at give or take 50% more than the standard market rate.
Q2 2024
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 7.8%, which was a touch below the 8.0% in the prior quarter. They said that despite
some commentary around E&S losing some momentum, they see the momentum for liability lines continuing as strong as ever
and pointed to property most likely being some of the slowing in the non-admitted market. They still think there is additional
momentum in property but it probably does not have the level of momentum it had last year. They are still seeing rate move up
in the line and expect they will continue to see it move up in the immediate future. For general liability, submission remains very
robust, both on the admitted and non-admitted side with the main driver being social inflation. They said commercial auto has
been in the cross-hairs of social inflation and they expect to see considerable firming in that line for that reason. In addition,
excess and umbrella to the extent it relates to commercial auto market. they expect to see firming there as well. In workers'
comp, they pointed to seeing signs of California rate bottoming out and think the rest of the country is probably a pace or two
behind. In D&O, their view is pricing has not bottomed yet but it is closing in on the bottom. On the reinsurance side, they
believe pricing is peaking but still view opportunity in the line as margins remain strong.
Q1 2024
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8% in Q4, a touch below 8.5% in Q3, due to business mix. Overall they view this
8% as exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss trend. Within property cat reinsurance, WRB viewed the market at
1/1/24 as very attractive, but maybe not as attractive as at 1/1/23. Further, they highlighted that there is a distinction between
property cat and property per risk reinsurance. They also said there is a distinction with the primary property market, where
they are pushing hard on rate, and it is sticking. Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8% in Q4, a touch below 8.5% in
Q3, due to business mix. Overall they view this 8% as exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss trend. Within
property cat reinsurance, WRB viewed the market at 1/1/24 as very attractive, but maybe not as attractive as at 1/1/23. Further,
they highlighted that there is a distinction between property cat and property per risk reinsurance. They also said there is a
distinction with the primary property market, where they are pushing hard on rate, and it is sticking. They spoke positively about
business continuing to go to the E&S market.
Q4 2023
WRB is very focused on social inflation and they said that you can see that in their rate increases (8.5% excluding workers'
compensation) and they intend to stay on top of it. The market has been accepting of its rate increases as shown in its steady
renewal retention of 80%. Specifically WRB is pushing very hard on rate within commercial auto and the market is accepting of
it - this led to strong growth in commercial auto in the quarter.
Q3 2023
WRB saw rate of 8.2% (ex workers' comp), which was relatively stable with the Q1 (at 8.3%) and reflective of its business mix.
WRB said that there continues to be a bifurcation in the standard market and E&S market. Within the standard market, where
National carriers do not have an appetite to write business that is leading to opportunities on the E&S side. WRB said that
submission flow remains robust, and they are encouraged about activity over the balance of the year, and flagged good results
in July. Overall WRB's view is that the industry is struggling with the balance between rate needs and keeping up with loss
trend versus their desire to grow.
Q2 2023
Regarding property, the company noted that its disappointment in Q4 pricing discipline has improved month over month,
resulting in what is regards as real progressing being made on the pricing front in April. The company feels the rationalization
of pricing in the property market, while more pronounced on the cat side, is broad-based overall. The company called out public
D&O, certain professional liability lines, and commercial auto as being the most irrational parts of the market. Still, WRB does
see pockets of opportunities even within professional liability, especially if written on an E&S basis.
Q1 2023
Period
Pricing Comments
Q4 2022
WRB said they were disappointed in the discipline in property pricing in the Q4 as they said many carriers failed to take into
account limited reinsurance capacity and higher reinsurance costs. They believe that property pricing should continue to
improve as 2023 develops. For workers' comp, they said they missed the timing on when the market would begin to harden and
they expect pricing to be bumpy in 2023 with expectation for considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given severity trends,
particularly medical inflation. For auto, they said there is rate to be had but remains the most susceptible line to social inflation
and requires thought and judgement in underwriting for loss costs. Umbrella and general liability excess are amongst the
brighter opportunities with one area on the cautious watchlist being large account excess lines. Professional liability is a tale of
two stores with D&O being pressured given the rising competitive landscape but other lines within professional liability should
provide good opportunities. WRB said they participated at 1/1 renewals and said the clock is right to lean in with good discipline
with the US offering more attractive returns than international.
Q3 2022
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers'
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to
see resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth
target, which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust.
In workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity
and erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from
that. Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable
momentum, up 45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing
is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something
measured in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious
and most of the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive
on WC pricing in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this
stage, particularly in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any current opportunities.
Q4 2021
It's a good moment for the P&C space, Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a
growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably
Q3 2021
attractive. And we don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-
related specialty writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty
and even more so in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's
definitely encouraging.

Summary of Estimate Changes
Estimates lowered. See below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q2 2024 earnings.
· 2024 EPS is down to $4.00 (unchanged) as higher NII fully offset a higher tax rate and weaker
underlying margins.
. 2025 EPS is down to $4.25 (from $4.30) reflecting a higher tax rate and weaker underlying
margins, partially offset by higher NII.
. 2026 EPS is down to $4.70 (from $4.80) reflecting a higher tax rate and weaker underlying
margins, partially offset by higher NII.
Equity Research
Our 2024 estimate is unchanged
as the Q2 beat was offset by
weaker underlying margins and
a higher tax rate. Our 2025 and
2026 estimates are revised down
due to a higher tax rate and
weaker underlying margins.

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB trades at 2.54x Q2 2024 book value, which is above the 5-year and 10-
year average multiples of 2.27x and 1.90x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 1.42x and 10-year
minimum is 1.20x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 2.99x, which is above where the shares are currently
trading. We do note that for the P&C sector price-to-book valuations are fuller given the unrealized
losses we have seen in this rising interest rate environment. For WRB, if we exclude AOCI, the shares
are trading at just around 2.24x adjusted Q2 book vs the 5-year average of 2.06x. On a P/E basis,
WRB is trading at 12.2x our 2025 EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year
average multiples of 16.1x and 16.8x, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year max is 25.0x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases and
growth in 2024, which we do not believe is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $59.00 from $62.00
. Our price target of $59 is based on just around a 2.3x multiple of our year-end 2025 book value estimate
· Our price target also represents a ~14.0x multiple against our 2025 EPS estimate.
· The 14.0x is a slight discount to where WRB has historically traded as we look to be conservative given social inflation impacting both
current and prior accident years.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe losses.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
FINRA regulation requires member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories: Buy, Hold and Sell. In accordance with FINRA regulation and solely to
satisfy those disclosure requirements in the ratings distribution table and ratings history chart contained in these Required Disclosures, our rating of Overweight
corresponds to a Buy rating; Equal Weight corresponds to a Hold rating; and Underweight corresponds to a Sell rating.
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
