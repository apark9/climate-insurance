UPDATE: 2Q22 Earnings Review:
Small Commercial in Focus
The overall tone from HIG remains cautiously optimistic,
particularly around its enhanced capabilities. Auto severity isn't
getting better. Trading at 8x 2023E P/E, HIG offers compelling
long term risk/reward in our view.

UPDATE This publication is an update to 'The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc .: 2Q22
Earnings Review: Small Commercial in Focus', originally published on 01 Aug 2022 at 00:10 EDT.
It corrects the comment that there is less granularity on pricing. While management shared less
data points on its 2Q earnings call vs. prior calls, renewal written price increases for small
commercial and middle market are available in its financial supplement.
Ramping up for renewal cycles: HIG's 17.2% NPW growth y/y in small commercial is its second
highest on record following 17.4% y/y in 4Q21. Bulking up on small commercial business means
HIG can be more prepared for potentially lower retentions amid a recession scenario (i.e.
business closures). Albeit, HIG thinks an inflation fueled 'mild' recession will pale in comparison
to pandemic fueled recession for its small commercial business, given the shelter in place piece.
At the trough of the pandemic, HIG's small commercial policy count retention only fell to 79% in
3Q20 from its typical mid 80s range. HIG attributes growth in small commercial to new products
& cross selling (i.e. E&O) and audit exposures. HIG also admitted that it is pushing itself outside
of its historically conservative risk appetite.

On the personal auto side, HIG's flat PIF growth q/q in this business is ahead of its historical
trend. Over exuberance on its Prevail platform may be the driver. HIG is also attributing growth
in the age 50+ cohort. HIG considers the customer life cycle in its growth ambitions - a fair
strategy if auto headwinds subsides in short order, not as good if adverse loss trend persists. In
fact, HIG expected to see some moderation in severity trends and, to date, that has not been the
case with physical damage up 2.5 pts. HIG updated its guided '22 personal lines underlying
combined ratio (+1-2 pt above original 90-92%) based on auto inflationary impacts and less
optimism for improvement. Auto underlying combined ratio deteriorated sequentially to 100%
in 2Q22 from 93.3% in 1Q22. Recall, on a seasonality perspective, 1Q loss ratio runs lower on
average than the year.

An industry debate this quarter has been centered around how a piece of exposure can act like
rate. HIG defines pricing as pure rate and exposure. Just as the prior quarter, about 1.5 points of
its commercial pricing is attributed to exposure growth. Particularly, HIG thinks wage growth
acts like rate with indemnity payment offsets. HIG is maintaining its loss trends of ~5%

excluding workers' compensation, 100 bps below its pricing level of 6.1%. Likewise, HIG has
maintained a long-term medical inflation pick of 5% vs benign trends over the last few years.
Sequential commercial underlying margin expansion (20 bps), though we think investors are
scrutinizing the sources. HIG's small commercial underlying combined ratio of 86.9% while
strong deteriorated sequentially 1 pt. We were surprised to see global specialty outperform
small commercial with an 83.1% underlying combined ratio and 5.1 pt improvement q/q.
Sustainability of recent performance within global specialty should bode well for the stock
given not too long ago it dragged earnings. HIG also experienced lower than normal non-cat
losses (although higher than the prior year). All in, HIG is likely past its trough back in 3Q21, with
a commercial underlying combined ratio of 87.2% vs. 88.1% in 2Q22, 88.3% in 1Q22 and 88.9%
in 4Q21.
We expected HIG to make greater traction in improving its expense ratio as part of its Hartford
Next initiative. Still, we think HIG will meet its '22 outlook of achieving an underlying combined
ratio within Commercial of 86.5%-88.5% (our estimate 88.0%).
With 13% total commercial NPW growth in 1H22 vs. 1H21, we think HIG will beat its guided 4-5%
commercial NPW growth for '22. Our estimates acknowledge management's sentiment that
commercial growth will slow in 2Q22 vs. 1Q22.
Peer Leading P&C ROE: HIG's core ROE of 14.0% is at the upper end of its 13-14% '22 guidance.
In particular, its core ROE in P&C of 17.9% is peer leading and ahead of its segment guide of 14-
15%. Though, 2Q results benefited from lower catastrophe losses than normalized levels and
higher favorable PYD. HIG's core ROE within group benefits was disappointing at 3.7% and well
below its segment guide of 10-11%. Lastly, Hartford Funds core ROE of 55.9% is trending above
its segment guide of 54-55%. Note, HIG excludes AOCI from the denominator of its CORE ROE.
Strong alternative returns (with annualized LP yield of 17.3% pre-tax vs. 8-10% guide).
Nonetheless, HIG anticipates annualized LP returns in 2H22 could trail its full year annualized
target, though 2H22 LLP returns should be positive. HIG's annual portfolio turnover rate is 10-
15%. New money rate of about 4.5% is ahead of its 3.6% average yield of assets rolling off. HIG is
expecting ex LP yields to increase 10-20 bps during 2H22.
Capital Returns: During 2Q22 HIG repurchased $450mn of shares in 2Q22 (vs. our $300mn
estimate) and $107mn from July 1-27, 2022. HIG's new $3bn share buybacks program, effective
Aug 1, '22- YE24, is below our original $3.6bn cumulative estimate (3Q22-4Q24) going into the
quarter (we have since recasted our estimates to align with the new plan).

Why OVERWEIGHT?
HIG has sound fundamentals following
transformation, which should continue
to drive a stronger book multiple. ROE
convergence with peers should make
current valuation look inexpensive.
Navigators acquisition is becoming
more accretive given boost from hard
pricing in specialty lines. HIG has
accelerated the pace of its expense
savings plans.
Upside case
USD 87.00
Our upside case reflects stronger than
expected underwriting margin
expansion and commercial P&C
pricing levels and improving group
benefits margins. Our upside case is
~1.5x '23 BVPS ex AOCI.
Downside case
USD 62.00
Our downside case assumes
unsuccessful underwriting margin
expansion and expense savings as well
as a slowdown in the commercial P&C
renewal rate environment. Our
downside case is ~7.7x '23E EPS.

2Q22 vs. Target Financial Plan
HIG updated its guided '22E personal lines underlying combined ratio ( +1-2 pt above original
90-92%) based on auto inflationary impacts and less optimism for improvement. We are
estimating a 92.8% '22E personal lines underlying combined ratio. HIG's personal lines
underlying CR was 94.1% in 2Q22.
Commercial lines underlying CR of 88.1% in 2Q22 is on track to meet HIG's 2022E outlook range
of 86.5%-88.5%. Group Benefits 9.8% core earnings margin and 9.3% ex COVID in 2Q22 is ahead
of the 2022E outlook ranges (3.1-5.4% inc. COVID and 6-7% ex COVID) in the quarter. We are
modeling better commercial lines premiums in 2022 than HIG's plan (BARC: 11.8% vs. HIG: 4-
5%).

Personal Lines
HIG is pushing rate increases and focusing on its Prevail roll out. On the auto side, HIG received
an average 5.7% rate increase on its 39 auto state filings in 1H22. A notable achievement; still,
we think more rate is needed. Auto accident year loss ratio increased by 5.7 pts in 2Q vs. 1Q.

Personal Underwriting Performance
The auto underlying combined ratio of 100% was up 6.7 pts sequentially. HIG saw higher than
expected severity, most evident in physical damage. We recognize that part of auto
performance is seasonality, with its loss ratio running lower on average in 1Q vs. the year.
2 August 2022

Barclays | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
The homeowners underlying combined ratio of 82.0% was up 4.6 pts q/q.
Underlying Commercial Margin
Commercial lines underlying margin improved to 88.1% ~1.3 pts y/y and 0.2 pts q/q. HIG is
targeting commercial lines underlying combined ratio of 86.5%- 88.5% in 2022 (BARC estimate
88.0%).
Segment Underlying Results:
· Middle & Large Commercial underlying combined ratio of 92.9% in 2Q22 worsened from
91.5% in 1Q22.
· Small Commercial underlying combined ratio at 86.9% in 2Q22 worsened from 85.9% im
1Q22.
. Global Specialty underlying combined ratio of 83.1% in 2Q22 improved from 88.2%in 1Q22.
Group Benefits
Core earnings margin of 9.8% is trending above'22 guidance including COVID of 3.1%-5.4%, and
better than our estimate of 2.9%). HIG's favorable PPD of excess claims more than offset COVID
claims in 2Q22. Therefore, its margins included a pandemic benefit of $5mn pre-tax and a $5mn
benefit related to pre-tax COVID-19 related short term disability claims. The group benefits core
earnings margin adjusted for pandemic excess mortality and COVID-19 ST disability losses was
9.3%, above its guided range of 6-7%.
Forward Looking Commentary/Model Updates
· HIG updated its guided '22E personal lines underlying combined ratio (+1-2 pt above
original 90-92%) based on auto inflationary impacts and less optimism for improvement.
We are modeling a personal lines underlying combined ratio of 92.8% for '22E, 91.1% for
'23E and 90.9% in '24E.
. New money rate of about 4.5% is ahead of its 3.6% average yield of assets rolling off. HIG is
expecting ex LP yields to increase 10-20 bps during 2H22. During 1H22 HIG recorded a 3.0%
annualized investment yield, pre-tax and ex LLP, on an amortized cost basis where
applicable. On the same basis, we are estimating a 3.2% yield in 2H22.
· HIG anticipates annualized LP returns in 2H22 could trail its full year annualized target,
though 2H22 LLP returns should be positive. To provide context, HIG posted 16.3% (pre-tax)
annualized LLP returns in 1H22. In order to arrive at < 8-10% annual target, we are
estimating 0.2% returns in 2H22, a key driver of our EPS updates in 3Q22E and 4Q22E.
· Capital Returns: During 2Q22 HIG repurchased $450mn of shares in 2Q22 (vs. our $300mn
estimate) and $107mn from July 1-27, 2022. HIG's new $3bn share buybacks program,
effective Aug 1, '22- YE24, is below our original $3.6bn cumulative estimate (3Q22-4Q24)
going into the quarter (we have since recasted our estimates to align with the new plan).
We reiterate our Overweight rating on HIG and lower our PT to $78 (from $80) based on a
50/50 weighted 10.5x $8.03 (down from $8.24) '23E EPS and 1.2x 2023E book value per share ex
AOCI of $59.2 (down from $60.4). Trading at 8x 2023E P/E, HIG offers one of the best long term
risk/reward in P/C insurance, in our view.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

Valuation Methodology: Our $78 price target on HIG is based on a 50/50 weighted 10.5x '23E EPS and 1.2x 2023E book value per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
