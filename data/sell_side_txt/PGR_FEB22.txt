Feb. '22 Earnings: Dwindling PIF
Growth
We anticipate a long grind for PGR to get back to double-digit
PIF personal auto growth. Commercial writing uptick may be
less repeatable.

PGR's underlying loss ratio of 74.1% in Feb. was better than our expected 75.1%, yet worse than
Jan. 68.8%. We think January is a tough comparison thanks to the frequency tailwind from
Omicron. We are seeing opposite indications of used car sales based on CPI vs. Manheim data
(see Figures 4 & 5). A more conservative approach would be to lean in on CPI data. We also
learned on PGR's investor call on March. 1st that we may see a delay in the cost of auto physical
damage (i.e. used car parts) and collision with third parties reflecting subrogation. We also think
war may bring on further supply chain disruptions.

Potential Upside/Downside
-18.0%
PIF growth slowdown: PGR's total personal auto PIF y/y growth slowed (+2.8%, in line with our
estimate of +2.8%) driven by a slowdown in auto direct (+4.7% vs. our +4.6%) and auto agency
(+0.7% vs. our +0.5%). We anticipate a long grind for PGR to get back to rate adequacy and
double-digit PIF growth. PGR plans to take multiple bites of the apple in its rate request journey.
We include in this note our analysis of PGR's approved and pending rate filings (the latter
on 15% of its premiums). PGR is making progress in its rate filings journey, yet we have not
seen nationwide momentum. We think some state regulators question if miles driven will ever
return to pre-pandemic levels. Other states (particularly catastrophe prone) may want to put a
lid on overall consumer costs when considering higher homeowners' premiums and utility
costs, in our view.

We think PGR's commercial NPW growth of 104% is less repeatable (more on this). Bottom line,
we are concerned that PGR may be increasing its focus on more capital-intensive business that
may weigh in on its ROE profile in the longer term.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving business
mix, which could lower ROEs. Likewise,
we struggle to see how PGR could
return to its historical PIF growth rate,
as the company cut rates early during
the pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 120.00
If PGR is able to achieve personal auto
rate adequacy and return to historical
PIF growth rates. If PGR leverages its
multivariate pricing model across
newer business lines. Upside case
reflects ~24x '23E EPS.
Downside case
USD 75.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with greater
rate catch up. Downside case reflects
~15x '23E EPS.

Looking at February renewal effective dates, PGR received 24 rate approvals in 6 states: AK, IL,
ME, OH, SC, and UT, ranging from 0% to ~20%. PGR's rate approvals show a weighted average of
+11.4% approvals on ~$1.9bn of subject premiums, or ~$218mn in additional premiums, which
in our view does not move the needle that much.
Last year, PGR swiftly graduated from rebates to rate decreases well ahead of the industry. This
implies that PGR has to catch up more than other industry participants on the rate side to get to
a better baseline pricing spot.
Pending Filings: So far the total ask is +10% on subject premiums
PGR has submitted pending rate increases through renewal effective dates June '22 in just 9
states, not nationwide: DC, FL, GA, HI, ID, MD, NJ, TN, TX. Similar to the approved filings, PGR's
pending rate increases show a weighted average of 10% approvals on ~$5.5bn of subject
premiums, or ~$555mn in additional premiums. We do not think pending filings is enough to
make a significant impact considering the scope of PGR's total personal auto written premiums.
To put that in context, PGR reported ~$36.2bn of personal auto premiums in 2021, therefore
pending rate requests are on about 15% of its premiums.
PIF Growth Spotlight
PIF growth y/y trend continued to moderate in February: Personal auto
2.8% (in line with our modeled 2.8%)
On a sequential basis, personal auto PIF growth fell -0.1% m/m (vs. our modeled -0.2%).

Inflation: Manheim vs. CPI Disconnect
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers rose 7.9% over the 12 months from
February 2020 to February 2021. Leading pricing indicators were: used car and truck up 41.2%
(vs. 40.5% in Jan.), though we have seen car and truck rentals up 24.3% in Jan. (vs. 29% in
Jan.). Manheim is showing an opposite trend in used car sales - moderation not rising.
While Omicron may help on the frequency side in the short term, we think on a lagged basis the
variant may lead to greater supply chain disruptions, pressuring used car sale and parts prices.

PGR reported a m/m deterioration of its underlying loss ratio: 74.1% (Feb) from 68.8% (Jan.).
We think last month's underlying loss ratio was artificially low thanks to Omicron frequency
tailwind and questionable loss picks. We had modeled a more conservative 75.1%. PGR's
property loss ratio (ex cats) of 52.6% has not kept up with its high 40%s level in the last few
months. However, lower premiums than PGR's historical run rate elevate the fixed portion of
expenses. We saw PGR's expense ratio decline sequentially to 19.0% from 19.6% (we estimated

Commercial NPW Growth of 104% (y/y) in Feb. '22
PGR's uptick in TNC business reflected: 1.) Shift to 12 month policies from 6 months 2.) higher
premiums linked to anticipated more miles driven 3.) rate increases. Excluding TNC, PGR would
have shown 40% y/y increases in NPW, owed to "for hire" transportation segment (riskier
vehicle classes).

Valuation
We raise our PT to $88 from $85 as we changed our methodology to base our multiples off 2023E
rather than a 2022E/2023E blend. As such our $88 PT reflects a 16x EPS and 2.9x BVPS (ex AOCI).
Model Updates:
Although we typically base our loss ratio expectations on a rolling 3 month average, we discount
Jan. loss experience due to Omicron. We included PGR's $1.5bn debt raise in March, we expect
incremental interest expense will start to be reflected in 3Q22.
Updated '22E EPS to $4.49 from $4.31 and '23E EPS to $5.04 from $5.07.
Updated '22E BVPS ex AOCI to $30.86 from $31.63 and '23E BVPS ex AOCI to $33.02 from $33.82.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $88 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.9x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2023E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
