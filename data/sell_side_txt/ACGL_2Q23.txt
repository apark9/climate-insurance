Robust Margins Drove Strong 2Q23 Results
ACGL's results were significantly better than assumed. EPS beat forecasts,
margins were robust, and premiums rose at a strong pace. We consider Arch a
premier franchise and one of the best positioned carriers to take advantage of hard
reinsurance pricing. Still, we are Neutral on the stock due to valuation.
Â· EPS upside; increasing projections. ACGL reported 2Q23 operating EPS of
$1.92, well above our $1.57 estimate and consensus of $1.59, driven by higher
investment income and upside in underwriting margins in all major divisions.
Compared with our model, cat losses lifted EPS by $0.01 and prior-year
development was in-line. Although cat losses and PYD should fluctuate on a
quarterly basis, the upside in investment income is likely to sustain. As a result,
we are raising our 3Q23 EPS forecast from $1.15 to $1.22 and our 2024
projection from $6.34 to $6.69.
. Business trends were strong. Reinsurance results were marked by robust
premium growth (NWP up 47% versus our 39% estimate) and better than
assumed margins (CR 82.0% versus our 84.3% estimate). Similarly, insurance
premiums increased 18% (versus 15%E) and margins were strong (CR 91.9%
vs. 94.7%E; CR ex. cats and PYD 89.8% vs. 90.0%). As in 1Q23, insurance
premiums increased across all major market segments with the exception of
professional lines, which continues to suffer from soft pricing. MI earnings
were significantly better than assumed as well, helped by favorable PYD (CR
15.0% vs. 30.0%E; CR ex. PYD 43.7% vs. 45.0%). Weak MI premiums was
one of the only major negatives. As assumed, ACGL did not repurchase stock
in 2Q23. Management comments on business trends were upbeat.
. Our long-term outlook for ACGL is mixed, but we expect the company to
report robust results in the near term. ACGL's results in the next few
quarters should be marked by strong margins and top-line growth in the
reinsurance business and healthy margins but weak premium growth in the MI
business. MI margins should remain healthy, but we project them to moderate
from recent levels as reserve releases wane. Potential weakness in the housing
market or uptick in unemployment would pressure MI results, although they
do not pose a risk to near-term results. Meanwhile, the hard market is a key
positive for near-term results in the reinsurance business. Still, our long-term
view of the reinsurance business is cautious as we expect additional capacity
to enter the market over the next 1-2 years. Our model assumes no share
repurchases in 2023 given the current stock price and management's intent to
deploy capital into the business amid hard reinsurance pricing.
J.P. Morgan
. We affirm our Neutral rating. We consider ACGL a top-tier franchise, but in
relatively commoditized markets. In our view, ACGL is among the best
positioned carriers to take advantage of hard reinsurance pricing. Still, our
long-term outlook for the reinsurance market remains negative. Also, we
believe that ACGL's valuation is not enticing relative to the company's long-
term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Arch is a premier re/insurance franchise with a track record of
higher and less volatile underwriting margins than most peers.
Still, we are Neutral given our cautious long-term outlook for the
P&C reinsurance market and the stock's valuation. In our view,
near-term results in the MI business will be marked by weak
premium growth and moderating margins as reserve releases
wane. Over time, we expect MI returns to be held back by the
commoditized nature of the product, black box pricing, and
higher capital requirements. In P&C reinsurance, hard pricing
and tighter terms/conditions should boost underwriting results
in the near term, but our long-term outlook is negative as we
expect the entry of additional capacity to preclude a sustained
hard market.

In our view, ACGL is a key beneficiary of hard reinsurance pricing, but we are
Neutral on the stock given its valuation. We believe that ACGL has an industry-
leading reinsurance business with a unique culture and approach to underwriting that
should produce above-average, and less volatile, margins over time. Also, Arch is a top
competitor in the mortgage insurance (MI) market, which we consider a structurally
better business than P&C reinsurance. In the primary P&C market, ACGL has gained
share and expanded margins, helped by favorable pricing. In the near term, we expect
ACGL to report strong margins and top-line growth in re/insurance, and moderating
margins but poor premium growth in MI. Still, despite near-term tailwinds, our long-
term outlook for the reinsurance market remains cautious and we expect structural
dynamics such as the commodity nature of the product and low barriers to entry to
preclude sustained hard pricing. Furthermore, we feel that ACGL's valuation is not
enticing relative to reinsurance or MI peers.
P&C Reinsurance: N-T Outlook Upbeat; L-T Negative
We expect near-term results in ACGL's reinsurance business to benefit from hard
pricing and tighter terms, but our long-term outlook for the market is cautious.
Arch has historically generated better and less volatile margins than most reinsurers,
which we attribute to its focus on specialty reinsurance (where pricing tends to be less
competitive), conservative underwriting, ability to shift mix based on changing market
conditions, and judicious management of catastrophe risk. In particular, ACGL prices
business using the risk-free rate (leading to more conservative underwriting), and uses a
long-term compensation plan for underwriters that pays based on underwriting margins
over a multi-year period. Also, the creation of 3rd party capital vehicles such as Premia
Re has allowed Arch to earn fee income. We view Arch as a top-tier reinsurer and
expect firm pricing to boost results in 2023 and potentially 2024. Still, our long-term
outlook for the reinsurance market is cautious given its commoditized nature, the ease of
entry of new capital, and a broad set of capital providers (including some, such as
pension funds, with lower return thresholds). We are skeptical of prolonged hard pricing
and believe that 1-2 years of strong margins will attract new capacity into the market. In
our opinion, any signs of additional capacity entering the market would hurt investor
sentiment on reinsurance stocks, which have become consensus longs since late 2022.
Mortgage Insurance: Growth Weak; Margins to Moderate
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance through acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and United
Guaranty in 2016) when market conditions were favorable, marked by appreciating
home prices, stringent lending standards at mortgage issuers, and disciplined pricing by
mortgage insurers. Arch's MI business has generated healthy margins since then and,
despite the temporary setback from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have
been strong. In our view, MI margins will remain healthy in the near term, but will
moderate from recent levels as the benefit of COVID-related reserve releases tapers off.
Meanwhile, higher interest rates are likely to suppress mortgage origination volumes. A
recession would increase defaults and pressure margins, but this is not imminent.

2Q23 Details
This evening, ACGL announced 2Q23 operating EPS of $1.92, significantly above our
$1.57 estimate and consensus of $1.59. Compared with our model, underwriting income
beat in all major divisions, and was especially strong in mortgage insurance. Investment
income was considerably higher than assumed as well, and the tailwind is likely to
sustain in future periods. Meanwhile, catastrophe losses and prior-year development
were close to our assumption.

Mortgage Ins .: Earnings Upside Driven by Reserve Release
In our view, mortgage insurance (MI) results will be marked by lackluster
premium growth, robust persistency, and strong (but lower) margins. Higher
interest rates should suppress mortgage insurance volumes, and we expect moderating
reserve releases from cures of COVID-related delinquencies to drive a decline in
margins to more normal levels. The MI business reported underwriting income of $253
million in 2Q23, well above our $198 million estimate, driven by better than expected
margins (CR 15.0% vs. 30.0%E) and better net earned premiums (-0.6% from 2Q22 vs.
-6.9%E). Similar to recent quarters, the earnings upside was primarily due to the release
of reserves, and management implied that cures for both COVID-impacted and non-
COVID impacted cohorts (accident years 2020 to 2022) were responsible for the
tailwind (-28.7% on CR vs. - 15.0%E; $84 million vs. $41 million in dollar terms). Core
margins were better than assumed as well (CR ex. cats and PYD 43.7% vs. 45.0%E) due
to a lower attritional loss ratio (24.3% vs. 25.0%E) as well as a lower expense ratio
(19.4% vs. 20.0%E). On a negative note, gross written premiums declined 6.7%, the
third straight quarterly decline. Net written premiums declined by an even greater
magnitude due to a lower retention ratio compared to 2Q22. Management attributed the
drop in gross written premiums to lower originations in the Australian market and a
decrease in U.S. primary mortgage insurance business, partially offset by higher credit
risk transfer transactions.
In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were hurt by artificially high delinquencies caused
by homeowners availing of government forbearance programs. However, after initially
spiking in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has steadily declined. In particular,

with the expiry of the forbearance programs, a significant portion of previously
delinquent loans has cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were taking advantage
of the mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial distress. Meanwhile, the
significant appreciation in house prices has provided a cushion to homeowners under
stress who are truly struggling to pay their mortgages, limiting losses for MI carriers.
The percent of loans in default in the U.S. primary MI business was 1.6% at 6/30/23,
down from 1.7% at 3/31/23 and 1.8% at 6/30/22.

We expect MI margins to benefit from reserve releases, but the tailwind should
abate compared to recent levels. Higher reported delinquencies at the onset of COVID
led Arch and its MI peers to establish corresponding reserves despite the healthy labor
market and appreciation in house prices. A meaningful portion of these delinquencies
were due to homeowners taking advantage of the government's forbearance protection
programs (mainly to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship. However, under
U.S. GAAP accounting, Arch had to establish reserves based on reported delinquencies
despite the high likelihood that the delinquencies would eventually cure (unlike other
P&C lines an IBNR component is not permitted under U.S. GAAP for primary MI
business). With most of these delinquent loans curing following the expiration of
forbearance programs (initially set for 12/31/20, but then extended through 9/30/21 and,
in some cases, year-end 2021 or beyond), ACGL has been releasing previously incurred
reserves. Still, despite an expected decline, we forecast MI margins to remain healthy
given the strong labor and housing markets, cures on previously delinquent loans, and
the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due to the appreciation in house prices.
On a cautious note, top-line growth is likely to be weak as higher interest rates reduce
mortgage originations. A weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead to higher
defaults on mortgages, but a material uptick in losses seems unlikely in the near term.
Barring a recession, we expect core margins to stay healthy, although a declining
tailwind from reserve releases will drive a drop in margins and earnings from levels in
recent years even if economic trends stay favorable.
ACGL has become a leading competitor in the MI market through acquisitions and
could expand further via M&A, although deals seem unlikely in the near term.
ACGL entered the mortgage re/insurance business in 2011 but was only marginally

involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit
unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The company's
2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger
foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P)
and gained distribution in the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch became a top 10
competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market position strengthened
further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which
catapulted it to a top-3 spot (as part of the deal AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance
blocks originated by UGC pre 2017). Arch has also expanded in foreign MI markets
through M&A, including its acquisition of Westpac's mortgage insurance business in
Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Upside in Margins and Premiums Lifted Results
Insurance division results were marked by better than expected underwriting
margins and premium growth. Underwriting income in 2Q23 was $108 million, ahead
of our our $71 million estimate, driven by healthy margins (CR 91.9% vs. 94.7%E). A
better than assumed attritional loss ratio, lower cat losses, and more favorable
development offset a higher expense ratio. Net premiums written increased 18.4% from
2Q22, exceeding our 14.7% assumption, which ACGL attributed to new business,
higher prices, and an increase in reinsurance retentions. All major products in the
insurance division reported premium growth except for professional lines, where pricing
has been more challenging.

We feel that Arch has attractive opportunities in the primary P&C market, and
project premium growth and margins to remain strong. After shrinking its "cycle
managed" business (now dubbed as wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to 2017,
ACGL is seeing strong growth in this part of its primary book, driven by price hikes in
the broader market, particularly E&S. Results in less opportunistic parts of ACGL's
book (specialty small/middle market and franchise) have been healthy as well. High
inflation and rising reinsurance costs are driving an uptick in insurance pricing,

especially in property and cat-exposed lines. However, we believe that the tailwind from
price hikes in the primary market is unlikely to drive improvement in margins as
elevated inflation and the spike in reinsurance costs present bigger headwinds.
Management teams, and many investors, are optimistic about improving non-cat
margins at commercial insurers, but we feel that assessing results on a non-cat basis is
not relevant given the significant increase in reinsurance retentions at primary
companies. On an overall combined ratio basis, results for most primary insurers have
been weak given elevated cat losses. Reinsurers' cat losses have been high as well, but
to a significantly lesser extent. We feel that consensus EPS forecasts for commercial
lines insurers do not adequately reflect the shift in cat loads from reinsurers to primary
companies following higher retentions with 2023 reinsurance renewals.
Reinsurance: Strong Results, Near-Term Outlook Upbeat
The reinsurance business generated robust premium growth and healthy margins.
Underwriting income in 2Q23 was $245 million, above our $224 million estimate,
driven by strong underwriting margins (CR of 81.9% vs. 84.3%E). Core margins were
better than expected as well (CR ex. cats and PYD 77.4% vs. 85.3%), as a better
attritional loss ratio (50.8% vs. 58.3%E) more than offset higher cat losses and less than
expected favorable development. Net written premium growth was robust, up 47.0% to
$1.7 billion, above our +38.8% assumption. Similar to the insurance segment,
management attributed premium growth to new business, higher prices, and an increase
in retentions/less retrocession. Management sounded upbeat on ACGL's position in the
market amid constricted capacity from competitors, and noted that it expects the market
to remain firm longer than previous hard market cycles. Arch affirmed our view that
most primary insurers have started to retain more risk given higher reinsurance pricing,
implying higher potential cat loads for primary insurers and lower for reinsurers relative
to historical levels in the near term.

We remain skeptical of sustained hard reinsurance pricing, but market trends are holding
up better than our initial assumptions and we feel Arch is better positioned than peers in
this environment. ACGL's reinsurance segment was initially established to take
advantage of the hard market for casualty coverage in the early 2000s. Over the years,
however, management has shifted Arch Re's business mix away from casualty risks
towards other specialty lines such as surety, accident and health, agriculture, and trade
credit, which are generally less competitive and have more attractive risk-reward. The
hard pricing environment has boosted results in recent years and should drive continued
strong premiums and margins in the near term, especially following Hurricane Ian.
Nonetheless, we expect the pace of price hikes to moderate longer term and remain
skeptical of a sustained hard reinsurance market given the expected entry of additional
capacity. Factors that contributed to a multi-year soft market prior to 2018 (glut of
capital, greater fluidity/speed of capital, more providers of capacity, broker
consolidation) are still prevalent, and should preclude a prolonged hard reinsurance
market. On the other hand, ACGL's reinsurance results could benefit from the release of
COVID-related reserves, a significant proportion of which remain in IBNR. Similarly,
we feel that loss reserves which were set up for Ian could ultimately prove to be too
conservative (most primary companies booked lower Ian-related losses than reinsurers).
Raising EPS Estimates
We are raising 3Q23 EPS from $1.15 to $1.22, 2023 EPS from $5.94 to $6.44, and
2024 EPS from $6.34 to $6.69. The increase in our estimates is primarily due to higher
assumed investment income, which is benefiting from an uptick in yields as well as
robust premium growth. We consider catastrophe losses (which would affect reinsurance
and insurance margins) and housing market trends (which affect MI margins and
premium growth) the key sources of potential variance in reported results and our
projections.

Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $82.00)
Investment Thesis
We view Arch as a premier re/insurance franchise but are Neutral on the stock due to
bullish investor sentiment and current valuation. In our opinion, ACGL has an industry-
leading reinsurance business that will generate superior and less volatile underwriting
margins over time due to its unique culture and approach to the market. Also, Arch is a top
competitor in mortgage insurance (MI), which we consider structurally better than P&C
reinsurance. In the near term, we expect MI results to remain healthy, but margins should
compress from recent levels as reserve releases taper off. Meanwhile, hard pricing should
boost premium growth and margins in the reinsurance segment. On the other hand, our long-
term outlook for the reinsurance business remains cautious and we are skeptical of sustained
hard pricing given structural issues such as low barriers to entry, increased participation by
third-party capital, and limited pricing power. In addition, the stock's valuation is not
compelling relative to ACGL's long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2024 price target from $75 to $82 to reflect our higher EPS
and book value estimates. Our price target assumes a 1.5x multiple on our 12/31/24E BV
ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.6x multiple on our 12/31/24E BV forecast, and an 11.0x multiple on
our 2025 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach with a sum-of-the-parts analysis
that values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from mortgage insurance. Our target
multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix, which has become more skewed to
mortgage insurance. ACGL trades at 2.2x BV and 12.3x 2024E EPS compared to 1.4x and
8.1x for the reinsurance sector, 1.1x and 7.7x for MI peers, and 1.8x and 11x for the broader
P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
Â· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for an extended period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
Â· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. In
our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, even as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
Â· Additional capacity enters the reinsurance market. This, in turn, could result in a
reversal in pricing trends and potentially drive a reduction in EPS estimates as well as
hurt sentiment on the sector.
Â· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
Â· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development has
been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in the pace
of development could pressure margins and returns.

because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
