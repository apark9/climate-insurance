Progressive Corp.
Net EPS Comes in Above Estimate as
PIF Growth Continues and
Catastrophe Losses Better than
Expected
Progressive's October results yielded a strong Net EPS beat as
catastrophe losses from named storms in the month were lower
than expected and on a segment basis, Property performed
much better than expected. Policies in force growth saw
another month of solid growth, beating across the board.

Summary: October net EPS of $0.69 comes in well above our estimate of $0.47. The beat comes
primarily due to strong performance in the Property segment and lower than expected
catastrophe losses for the month. Cat losses came in at $249 million which was significantly
below our $595 million estimate based on PGR's prior guidance on Hurricane Milton.
Progressive also saw favorable prior year development to the tune of $156.4 million translating
to 2.4 points. Company wide underlying loss ratio came in above our expectations at 72.4% vs.
our 67.4%. Underlying Combined ratio for October also came in 4 points above our estimate,
printing 92.6% vs. our 88.6%. PIF growth continues to be strong and beat solidly across the
board. NPW growth missed our mark of 29.7% by 10.8 points, coming in at 19.0%, potentially
signaling Progressive giving up rate in favor of growth. NPE growth of 18.6% came in above our
estimate of 17.2%. Overall, a solid print as PIF growth continued to remain strong, catastrophes
came in better than feared, sizeable favorable reserve development, and strong Property results
contributed to a bottom line beat. While the underlying loss ratio was a step back form the
recent trends, it moves around from month-to-month.

Personal Lines: Underlying loss ratio came in at 72.8%, above our 67.4% estimate. Expense
ratio came in at 20.3% which compares to our 21% estimate. NPW growth was 21.4% vs. our
33.8%, however, it we note that this dislocation is primarily a function of the reporting calendar
switch that is being put into effect following this month. NPE growth was solid at 22.1%, but still
below our 23.1% estimate. Personal Lines posted underwriting income of $296.1 million

compared to our $243.9 million. On a segment basis within Personal, Agent underlying
combined ratio of 91.4% was worse than our 86.6% estimate and Direct's underlying combined
of 94.4% also came in meaningfully below our 89.9% estimate.
Commercial Lines: Underlying loss ratio in Commercial Lines was 79.3%, significantly above
our 70.5% estimate. Commercial Lines saw solid NPW and NPE growth for the month, growing
13.2% y/y vs. our 15% and 4.4% y/y vs. our -8.2%, respectively. Underwriting income of $29.1
million came in below our $69.1 million estimate.
Property: Underlying loss ratio came in much better than expected at 32.3% vs. our 57.6% as a
function of materially lower catastrophe losses compared to our estimate. Expense ratio also
came in at 27.6%, 140 bps below our estimate of 29%, thus leading to a strong underlying
combined ratio beat, posting 59.9% vs. our 86.6% estimate. NPW growth was flattish y/y for
October vs. our 15.5% growth estimate, however, NPE growth of 10.9% beat our 9.3% estimate.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
Our optimism about the growth
trajectory of the company is offset
by our view that personal auto may
be entering a softer market with
intense pricing competition
reemerging quicker than expected.
Upside case
USD 323.00
Our upside case reflects a 100bps
increase in 23% ROE on the back of
strong PIF growth driven by the
Direct channel, resulting in an
increase in premium to the
regression line to 65%.
0.0%
Downside case
USD 242.00
Our downside case assumes a
decrease in ROE by 100bps to 21%
which reflects the possibility of an
accelerated decline in auto pricing
from intensifying competition,
resulting in a greater likelihood of
missing on street's 20% sales
growth estimate.

Summary: Following Progressive's October results, we adjusted a few of our assumptions
slightly, primarily around repurchases price and Property PIF growth. This led to changes in our
Net EPS estimates from $14.51 to $14.31 in 2025, and $14.44 to $14.23 in 2026. We remain Equal
Weight with a price target of $277.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services,
if applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $277 reflects a 5.0x P/BVPS xAOCI multiple on our 2Q25E BVPS xAOCI estimate of $55.55 which we derive
from a P/BV vs ROE regression and assuming PGR trades at a 57% premium to the regression line.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside Risks: The greatest upside risk is that PGR
executes on its growth strategy better than we anticipate driving top line led beat and raises. Downside Risks: We see downside risk if PGR is not able
to meet high expectations for growth or if that growth leads to more margin pressure than expected.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by
Barclays or a third party ("Information"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration
is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes ("ESG Regimes"), unless
otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers
or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification,
label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are
reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
