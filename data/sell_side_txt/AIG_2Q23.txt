2Q23 Earnings Review: PF Capital
Glimpse
NA Commercial pricing accelerates to 10% from 9% and
remains above loss cost trends of 6.5%. Although mid-year 25-
35% property catastrophe reinsurance pricing could dampen
underlying combined ratio expansion. PML reductions post
Validus sale are significant leading to greater capital efficiency.
Management expects PF AIG ex CRBG SHE ex AOCI to be $40bn on a bottom up approach:
"Based on the size, risk profile and profitability of
our General Insurance business and holding
company needs today, we estimate a pro forma
GAAP equity base, excluding AOCI, of
approximately $40 billion for AIG ex-Corebridge.
This is inclusive of about $4 billion in deferred tax
asset NOLs that we exclude for adjusted common
shareholders' equity calculation."

We understand that $40bn PF SHE ex AOCI for Remain Co. reflects to AIG's legal entity balance
sheet view and does not take into consideration an implied valuation for its remaining 65%
stake in CRBG, as that piece is not in AIG's starting point. In other words a bottom-up approach
as this is how AIG manages its capital for these businesses. We like to do some work (stay tuned)
on a top down approach since we expect CRBG's market value to converge with BV ex AOCI.
(Conversely, less relevant on an including AOCI basis given CRBG trades at a slight premium vs.
AIG on trailing P/B.)
AIG Remain Co FCFs: We think $2bn of GI operating dividends a year is a good run rate, after
taking into account debt servicing (guaranteed by AIG) of just over $500mn, that implies a FCF
just lower than $1.5bn. For illustrative purposes, if we assume 1.1x-1.2x P/B ex AOCI on $40bn of
PF SHE ex AOCI, and discount that back by one year, that implies a moderate 3-4% FCF yield.

Reduced PMLs post Validus sale. (1) net PMLs for all perils worldwide to decline by 45% at the
1 in 250 return period; (2) worldwide hurricane by 60% at the 1 in 250 return period and by 70%
at the 1 in 100 return period; (3) North America hurricane by 70% at the 1 in 100 return period;
(4) Japan earthquake by 50% at the 1 in 250 return period; (5) all perils in EMEA by 85% at the 1
in 250 return period and 75% at the 1 in 100 return period. In addition, AIG will likely purchase
an adverse development cover (ADC) to minimize potential future reserve exposure on the 95%
of in-force reserves that it will be economically responsible for. Under an ADC construct we
think the reinsurer would be the beneficiary of favorable PYD. Related research: Validus Re Sale
to RNR: Reduces Volatility, Yet Hard Market Timing Less Ideal 22 May 2023.
Validus impact to 2Q results: Accretive to the NA commercial combined ratio by >100bps in
2Q23. NA Commercial increased 18% y/y (+13% ex Validus)
Catch up PCG prop cat treaty & 2Q reinsurance renewals: While AIG's XOL property
catastrophe treaty renews in January, 20% of its overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in
2Q. Management successfully placed all its policies and mentioned that the market was more
orderly compared to 1/1. Mid-year cat pricing increased 25-35% y/y in the US (driven by
Florida) while international pricing was up 20-50% (driven by Australia and New Zealand). AIG
purchased additional retrocessional protection for Validus Re and a low XOL reinsurance
placement for a PCG ahead of wind season. Recall, at 1/1 renewal, AIG dissaggregated NA
commercial and PCG shared limits, resulting in a net reduction in PCG catastrophe reinsurance
coverage, therefore this incremental purchase feels like a catch up.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
We view AIG as a wait-and-see
proposition as it goes down the
complex path of deconsolidation as
well as ongoing initiatives to
achieve expense savings objectives.
Upside case
USD 68.00
Eventual successful
deconsolidation that yields a fair
market value resulting in a rerating
of AIG RemainCo. Our upside case
of $68 assumes ~9.5x our '24 EPS
estimate.
Downside case
USD 50.00
Adverse reserve development
accompanying expansion of
underwriting risk appetite too fast
too soon. Our downside case of $50
assumes ~7x our '24 EPS estimate.

NA Commercial Pricing Acceleration
NA commercial rate increases of 8% (vs 7% last quarter) and exposure growth of 2% (vs 2% last
quarter) sums up to 10% pricing increases (vs 9% last quarter), which is well ahead of loss cost
trends of 6.5% (unchanged). International Commercial rates increased 9% (vs 8% last quarter)
while exposure increased 1%.

NPW growth. GI NPW increased ~10% y/y thanks to growth in both the North American (up
17%) and International (up 3%) segments. NA Commercial increased 18% y/y (+13% ex Validus)
due to growth in retail property (>50% y/y), Validus (32% y/y), and Lexington (18% y/y) thanks to
growth in property (+38% due to retention, strong rate increases, and a >30% y/y increase in
submissions) and casualty (+41% due to strong retention and >90% increase in submissions).
International Commercial NPW increased by 6% y/y driven by property (+34% y/y), Talbot (+17%
y/y), and global specialty (up mid-single digits y/y). New business was up 10% y/y in NA
Commercial (ex Validus) and up 5% y/y in International Commercial. Conversely, financial lines
shrunk (7.4)% y/y - the brunt of which was experienced in NA while International is not
experiencing the same rate issues.
Forward Looking Statements
Corebridge. AIG ownership currently stands at 65.3%. AIG shared a base case of completing
another secondary offering by year end. CRBG announced yesterday that it has entered into a
definitive agreement to sell Laya Healthcare Limited to AXA for €650mn in cash. On the AIG
earnings call management had said that it expects the proceeds from this sale to be used for a
special dividend to CRBG shareholders. Management is also assessing the disposition of the UK
Life business that is part of CRBG.
Capital allocation. Proceeds from recent transactions (i.e., Validus, Crop Risk Services,
Corebridge) will predominately be used for share repurchases (repurchase program capacity
$7.5bn), which management expects to accelerate starting in 4Q23 and into 2024. This will drive
the share count to $600-650mn post deconsolidation of Corebridge. We note that management
3 August 2023
5
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
repurchased an additional $400mn shares in July 2023. Some of the proceeds will be used to
retire debt as AIG aims to reduce the leverage ratio to the low 20s.
Investment yields. Net investment income, on an APTI basis, was up 31% y/y and up 7% q/q on
a consolidated basis, helped by increases in all segments. Average new money yields are 5.46%
(~210 bps higher than the yield on sales and maturities). In General Insurance, fixed maturity
and loan portfolio yields increased by 93 bps y/y and 23 bps q/q. In Life and Retirement, the
yield increased 75 bps and 15 bps, respectively.
Private Client Select (PCS) launched as MGA. (1) ultra/high net worth business NPW forecast
to grow >75% in 3Q and 4Q; (2) earned premium growth expected to continue to accelerate in
3Q and 4Q - which will provide operating leverage and lower the GOE ratio in 3Q and 4Q; (3)
stranded costs from the transition of PCG to an MGA are expected to be eliminated over the next
18 months; (4) accident loss ratio for a high/ultra-high net worth business to improve due to
improved pricing in the admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitted
market.
Strategic portfolio optimization. Currently management is focused on: (1) investing in the
ultra/high net worth business in Personal lines, which management expects to reap benefits in
the back half of 2023 and into 2024; (2) digital workflow investments in Japan to scale products
across its wide distribution of agents, which AIG has been working on over the last 12-18
months; and (3) investments into the global action health business - although not material. AIG
stated that it likes the Talbot and Western World underwriting businesses that is not going to
RNR as part of the Validus Re sale.
Path to ROCE in double digits. Management reiterated it's 10%+ guidance. It is important to
keep in mind that when AIG talks about achieving double-digit ROCEs, that reference is on a
deconsolidated entity not an outlook on the current structure where AIG remains a majority
owner of CRBG. A leaner operating structure is a key tenet to get there. Last quarter, AIG
reiterated that it expected parent expense structure to be ~1-1.5% of premiums upon
deconsolidation
2Q Highlights
Underlying combined ratio of 88.0% (50 bps improvement y/y) vs. our estimated 88.4%.
· GI NPW increased ~10% y/y thanks to growth in both the North American (up 17%) and
International (up 3%) segments. We expect to learn on the earnings call the Validus
contribution to NA premiums. Property NPW increased 25.5% y/y and Specialty NPW grew
20.7% y/y. Conversely, financial lines shrunk (7.4)% y/y.
· Commercial Lines. NA Commercial AYLR of 60.5% (vs. our 61.0% estimate) deteriorated 60
bps q/q yet improved 2.8 pts y/y. International Commercial AYCR deteriorated by ~170 bps
y/y but improved by ~60 bps sequentially.
· Personal Lines. NA Personal Lines AYCR was again unprofitable at 107.1% in 2Q23, 107.6%
in 1Q23, 105.3% in 4Q22, and 99.7% in 2Q22).
Life and Retirement Spread expansion & growth: Within Individual Retirement (IR), base net
investment spread increased to 2.70% in 2Q23 vs. 2.60% in 1Q23. While FA sales were down 8%
y/y and down 44% q/q, FIA sales hit a record and were up 59% y/y and up 13% q/q. PRT sales
were strong at $1.9bn and up from $1.5bn in 1Q23.
Key Results
3 August 2023
6
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
EPS Beat: AIG's 2Q23 operating EPS of $1.75 was above our $1.48 estimate and $1.60 Street
consensus estimate. The beat was driven by better than expected cat losses, PYD and GI
underlying combined ratio vs our estimates.
BVPS (common) slightly fell to $58.49 in 2Q23, from $58.87 in 1Q23.
VII: Alternative returns were $58mn (pre-tax) worse than AIG's expectations.
Cat losses: $250mn (net of reinsurance) vs. our $306mn estimate.
Capital Management: Parent liquidity (ex CRBG) was $4.3bn at 6/30/23, up from $3.9bn at
3/31/23, reflected $1.2bn of proceeds from the CRBG secondary offering, $264mn from the
CRBG special dividend and $180mn from the CRBG share repurchase. AIG repurchased $554mn
of shares (vs. our $800mn estimate) and completed a senior debt redemption. On Aug. 1, AIG's
board approved a $7.5bn buyback program.
In June, AIG announced a secondary offering of Corebridge shares for proceeds of $1.2bn (see
our July 10 2Q23 Preview: Search for Proof Points note). AIG also participated in Corebridge's
buyback program by selling shares for $180mn.
Valuation
Our Equal Weight rating and $66 price target (was $58) are based on a 50/50 weighted average
of 9.2x (was 9x) our 2024 EPS estimate of $7.17 (was $6.96)and 0.65x (was 0.53x) our 2024 book
value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate of $101.25 (was $99.59).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Barclays | AIG, Inc.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
A: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has been lead manager or co-lead manager of a publicly disclosed offer of securities of AIG, Inc. in the previous
12 months.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
D: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. in the past 12 months.
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. within the
next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by AIG, Inc. and/or in any related derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from AIG, Inc. within the past 12 months.
L: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
N: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $66 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 9.2x our 2024 EPS estimate and 0.65x
our 2024 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given we expect lower ROEs.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a separation.
Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to walk away from
business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings or capital but
undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post separation may temper
AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
