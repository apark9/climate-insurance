Kinsale
2Q22: Strong Results, Favorable E&S Market a
Tailwind
KNSL's premium growth, investment income, and underwriting margins were
all better than expected in 2Q22, pointing to the longevity of the hard market
as well as the benefit of higher interest rates. We consider KNSL a high
quality E&S franchise and expect it to perform well through the underwriting
cycle. Also, we think KNSL's financial results are likely to exhibit positive
momentum over the medium term as it unwinds excess reserves on its balance
sheet, writes business at favorable prices/terms, and benefits from higher
interest rates. Still, we remain Neutral on the stock given its valuation as well
as the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle continues to
moderate (albeit more gradually than we had initially expected). Following the
quarter, we are raising our EPS estimates and price target.
· EPS upside. KNSL reported 2Q22 operating EPS of $1.92, well above our
$1.65 estimate and consensus of $1.62. Adjusting for the low tax rate this
quarter (16.5% vs. a more typical level of ~18% because of stock comp,)
KNSL's EPS would have been $1.89, with most of the upside versus our
model driven by underwriting margins (CR 76.8% vs. 80.0%E) and to a
lesser extent, investment income. Catastrophe losses (none vs. 1.0%E) and
reserve releases (-5.0% vs. - 3.5%E) were more favorable than our
assumptions. On a core basis, underwriting margins were also better, with a
lower expense ratio (20.5% vs. 21.5%E) more than offsetting a modestly
higher AY loss ratio (61.3% vs. 61.0%E). Net written premiums grew
+44.5% from 2Q21, above our +32.1% assumption. KNSL's results have
exceeded expectations for six consecutive quarters and we believe there
could be upside in our estimates from a lower combined ratio, higher
investment income, and premium growth.
· The operating environment remains favorable for KNSL, pointing to
ongoing momentum in its results. (1) Consistent with past quarters, the
company attributed strong premium growth to higher submission activity
from brokers and more favorable pricing as captured in its disclosure on
average premiums per policy ($14,200 in 2Q22 vs. $12,300 in 2Q21, ~13%
growth). (2) Once again, reserve releases this quarter were mostly from
accident years 2020 and 2021, which continue to develop more favorably
than KNSL's initial loss picks. (3) The increase in KNSL's investment
income appears to be mostly driven by business growth. Like other insurers,
KNSL has the option of boosting investment income by re-positioning into
higher yielding assets. (4) Expense leverage is working in KNSL's favor,
with recent earned premium growth (~40%) exceeding operating expense
growth of ~30%. (5) KNSL has secured debt financing to fund further
growth ($125 million note with $150 million upsize option, undrawn
$100 million credit facility with option to upsize to $130 million).

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small
commercial accounts. Our long-term outlook for KNSL is
upbeat given its large addressable market, superior technology
platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable
competitive advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full
and we are concerned about the risk of multiple compression
as the P&C pricing cycle continues to turn.

Please see Page 5 for tables
summarizing 2Q22 results.
KNSL will hold its earnings
conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern
on July 29, 2022.
The dial-in number for the call is
888-660-6493; code: 3573726.
The call replay will be available on
https://ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We affirm our Neutral rating. In our view, KNSL's premium volumes and margins
will continue to benefit from the firm E&S market. Also, we think that Kinsale's low
cost operating model is a sustainable competitive advantage across the pricing cycle,
especially against higher cost competitors like Lloyd's writers. On the other hand, the
stock's valuation seems full compared to commercial peers and specialist names
even after accounting for KNSL's growth potential and above-average margins.
Also, although favorable P&C market conditions have persisted longer than we had
initially anticipated and will have positive implications for Kinsale's balance sheet
reserves, we believe that the eventual turn in the P&C pricing cycle presents
downside risk to its above-average multiple.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
We expect the overall E&S market, where KNSL operates exclusively, to see strong
but moderating new business flows and price hikes over time, partly due to more
underwriters focusing on growth and greater appetite from admitted markets. Still,
we think KNSL can grow premiums at a healthy pace because of its relatively small
base as well as the fragmented nature of the pricing cycle whereby certain lines
(property, marine) are only beginning to benefit from harder prices despite a
slowdown in other lines and/or the broader market. With respect to profitability, we
expect the combination of price hikes - historical and prospective - and conservative
reserving to support healthy margins at KNSL over the medium term.
Low Expenses a Durable Competitive Advantage
KNSL operates with a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform that it
built from the ground up, in contrast to many of its peers that use unwieldy hybrid
systems consisting of legacy platforms and newer technologies. The net result has
been an operating model that has the capacity to take on significant business volumes
without sacrificing customer responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense
efficiency. With this model, our view is that KNSL will outperform higher cost
competitors (especially Lloyd's which is more than 20% of the E&S market) through
the pricing cycle. During softer markets, KNSL has the ability to grow premiums as
others pull back while maintaining above-average profitability. In hard markets,
Kinsale can operate as a price taker and generate an even larger excess return.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect price hikes to
continue moderating modestly through 2022 and 2023 as re/insurers re-position
themselves for growth and clients push back on rate-on-rate price hikes. This seems
to be reflected in multiples for commercial P&C names, which are essentially flat
versus pre-COVID levels, but less so for (most) specialist names like KNSL, which
are trading at a premium compared to historical levels. Given this, we see multiple
compression as a risk as pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in E&S
given its function as a safety valve for the P&C industry. While we believe that
KNSL will thrive even if prices soften and that some portion of recent market share
gains by the E&S industry are permanent, our view is that a reasonable valuation
analysis will have to look several years out because of KNSL's above-average
growth profile (our reference year is 2024), and would therefore have to account for
how conditions in the P&C market are likely to be at that future time.

Raising Estimates
We are increasing our EPS estimates (3Q22 from $1.58 to $1.63, 2022 from $6.75
to $7.08, 2023 from $7.87 to $8.16) to reflect modest revisions in our assumptions
for premium growth, margins/combined ratio, and investment income.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $230.00)
Investment Thesis
We maintain our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer
that operates exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small
commercial accounts. Our long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large
addressable market, superior technology platform, and low cost base, which we view
as a sustainable competitive advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at
current levels and we are concerned about the risk of multiple compression as the
P&C pricing cycle continues to moderate.
Valuation
We are establishing our December 2023 price target of $230, compared to our
prior December 2022 price target of $220. Our December 2023 target assumes a
3.8x P/BV target multiple on 2025 book value and a 20x P/E target on 2025 EPS.
These target multiples are well above peers', which we believe is supported by
KNSL's above-average premium growth (long-term low-to-mid teens growth versus
mid- to high-single-digit growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile
(80-85% combined ratio versus 85- 90% for peers). KNSL trades at 8.5x book value,
well above the specialty peer average (ex. PLMR) of 1.8x and commercial peers at
1.3x.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher
prices and greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If
current conditions persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our
forecasts and investor sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We
would expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds
growth expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned
pricing exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving
suggests margin improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin
improvement tracks higher than expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are
beginning to push back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are
deploying capital and positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to
turn, we believe there is a risk of multiple compression for insurers that have seen
an outsized benefit from higher prices.

· Adverse loss trends or social inflation re-emerge in casualty reserves.
Although unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and
low limits, the re-opening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up
liability claims.
· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has
a strong underwriting track record and it is entering new lines of business in a
very strong part of the cycle. Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage,
the impact of badly underwritten risks is likely to persist.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire
period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the
average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's)
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of
the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected
total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it
does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
