3Q24 EPS Beats on Cats and PYD,
Growth & Underlying Trends Mixed
We view the results as modestly favorable as AIG's reserve
development from recent accident years and catastrophe
experience held up better than expected. However, the
underlying accident year loss ratio performance was mixed and
expenses showed less progress on AIG Next than we expected.

Summary: AIG reported operating EPS of $1.23 which beat our estimate of $1.03 and consensus
of $1.10 driven in large part by less catastrophe losses and more favorable prior year
development than we expected. Within General Insurance the combined ratio excluding PYD
and cats came in at 88.3% which missed our estimate of 87.2% and the street estimate of 87.6%
due to higher than expected expenses in NA Personal Lines and International Commercial as
well as a miss on underlying loss ratios across International. On the pricing front, the press
release stated that Global Commercial Lines pricing (i.e. rate + exposure) increased 6% which
was an acceleration from 5% last quarter. It was also noted that this level of price is roughly in
line with loss cost trend suggesting a flattish loss ratio from here. Net Premium Written Growth
was -1% or 6% excluding Crop and Validus (both businesses sold) from the prior period. This top
line production was in line with our estimates with a beat vs. our estimates in North America
offset by lower NPW in International. We view the results as modestly favorable as AIG's reserve
development from recent accident years and catastrophe experience held up better than
expected; a benefit of the work management has done to reduce earnings volatility. However,
the underlying accident year loss ratio performance was mixed and expenses showed less
progress on AIG Next than we expected. We ultimately think the print will be viewed as more in-
line considering the different positives and negatives.

Prior Year Development: One of the bright spots of the result was favorable prior year
development of $165mn vs our estimate of $21mn and consensus of $34mn. Notably, more
recent accident years did not show a negative impact from casualty and were overall favorable.
It was however noted that there was a partial offset by a 2016 claim specific emergence on
European Excess Casualty as well as a legacy mass tort claim on US Excess Casualty. The US
Excess Casualty had to do with a specific claim on an older accident year which is largely
covered by the adverse development cover. While there are some nuances to the development
this quarter, we overall view this result favorably and are encouraged by AIG's better experience
on more recent accident years relative to the industry.

Capital: The capital update included $1.5bn of share repurchases which modestly missed our
estimate of $1.6bn and a holding company liquid asset balance of $5bn, down $0.3bn due to the
elevated repurchases relative to cash flow to the holding company this quarter.

North America Commercial: North America Commercial Lines reported underwriting income
of $96mn which beat our estimate of $71mn. The beat was driven by more favorable prior year
reserve development and a better expense ratio than we anticipated, partly offset by a miss on
the accident year loss ratio ex cats. We note that part of this dynamic was driven by a large
closeout transaction in the quarter that had the effect of increasing the loss ratio by 70bps,
although with a roughly offsetting impact going the other direction in the expense ratio. Net
Premiums Written decreased 3.9% which beat our estimated 9.0% growth.
North America Personal: North America Personal Lines reported an underwriting loss of
$59mn which missed our estimate of $49mn due to an elevated acquisition ratio. We note that
expenses have remained persistently high for this segment, particularly relative to discussion of
underwriting at the time AIG formed the MGA structure in this segment with Stone Point. We will
look to the call for more clarity on when we should expect this to begin showing more positive
momentum.
International Commercial: International Commercial reported underwriting income of
$320mn beat our estimate of $210mn driven by better than expected catastrophes as well as
favorable reserve development. However, the underlying loss ratio and expense ratio cause a
miss on the combined ratio excluding cats and PYD. Net Premiums Written increased 0.7%
which missed our estimated growth of 6.0%.
International Personal Lines reported underwriting income of $80mn which beat our estimate
of $14mn driven by lower catastrophes and general operating expenses.

Why OVERWEIGHT?
We are optimistic on AIG's balance
sheet strength and growth
prospects as it looks to re-lever its
balance sheet following years of
underwriting improvement and
expense cuts. The excess capital
levels over the next couple of years
should allow the company to
surprise to the upside on capital
deployment including distributions
through buybacks and dividends.
Upside case
USD 106.00
Our upside case reflects an increase
in ROE expectations to account for
improvement in profitability
stemming from current expense
management initiatives at play, in
addition to sustained benign claims
cost trend compared to the
industry.
Downside case
USD 76.00
Our downside case accounts for the
potential ROE drag if excess capital
remains idle in the balance sheet.

Model Update
We have updated our estimates to reflect the reported results and refined our projections. The
primary adjustments were related to lower growth than we anticipated in International,
modestly higher loss ratios ex cats and PYD, and higher expenses in Personal Lines persisting for
some time. These changes resulted in our 2024E/2025E/2026E EPS estimates changing from
$4.66/$6.78/$8.45 to $5.02/$6.70/$8.22. We remain Overweight and our target price is
maintained at $90.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $90 reflects a ~1.2x P/BV xAOCI multiple on our 3Q25E BV xAOCI estimate of $39.3 Billion which we derive
from a P/BV vs ROE regression, resulting in $78.0 standalone value, and adding $11.7 per share value from CRBG stake.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Downside Risks: We see the shares potentially
underperforming if AIG lets the greater levels of excess capital remain undeployed and ROE is constrained due to the ROE drag associated with it. This
could potentially cause negative EPS revisions. Additionally, if we are wrong about balance sheet strength and AIG's needs to adjusts reserves upward
it would likely weigh on the stock.

Russia: This material is not intended for investors who are not Qualified Investors according to the laws of the Russian Federation as it might contain
information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
