Oct. '22 Earnings: PIF Growth is Back;
Tests Underlying Results
PGR's underlying loss ratio has worsened in the last two
months (77.6% in Oct. & 77.2% in Sept.). It does not appear
PGR has reached rate adequacy yet, at least on an earned
basis. We think auto insurers have to push high single-digit to
low double-digit rate increases just to tread water amid
inflationary loss trends.

Any insurer can shrink their way to greatness. As counterintuitive as this may sound, it is much
easier to recognize margin expansion by shrinking when there are signs of pricing improvement.
Once an insurer begins to grow again, as in PGR's case now that PIF growth is back (+0.5%
personal auto), we worry that it may be challenging to operationally demonstrate the same
restraint and turn down business when appropriate. In 3Q22, PGR saw total new personal auto
application growth of 20% y/y, mostly driven by Direct +26%, followed by Agency +9%. There is
usually a new business penalty, and it takes a few policy terms to meet profitability hurdle rates.
It does not help that PGR is growing now while its underlying loss ratios are deteriorating.
PGR's underlying loss ratio worsened to 77.6% in Oct. from 77.2% in Sept. and 73.4% in August.
PGR's expense ratio fell to 18.3% in Oct. from 19.0% in Sept. and remains below pre-pandemic
levels (north of 20%). So while PGR's all-in combined ratio is just under its 96% target, we do not
think an expense ratio well below 20% (especially this quarter's 18.3%) is sustainable.

We are cautious regarding how swiftly underlying loss ratios can turn around, particularly given
PGR's stance that taking rating actions is behind the trend. In fact, auto insurers should be
pushing rate increases just for maintenance purposes, to keep up with loss trends that are still
accumulating; albeit at a moderating pace. PGR's underlying loss ratio three-month simple
average of 76.1% has a way to go to return to pre-pandemic levels (~68%). We think auto
insurers will approach rate adequacy in 2024. To be sure, not a return to 2019 levels.

CAT ALAE Debunked: Many investors viewed last month's underlying loss ratio with some
disbelief given PGR does not parse out its auto cat ALEA figure. On the earnings call, PGR
debunked that assumption as cat ALAE from auto is not a considerable contributor. A cleaner
print this month supports underlying loss ratio deterioration.
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +.05% in Oct. (better than our estimate of -0.4%),
mostly seen in auto agency (-3.6% vs. our -4.6%) followed by auto direct (+3.9% vs. our 3.1%).

Oct. operating EPS of $0.40 beat our $0.33 estimate as catastrophe losses were better than
expected. During Oct., PGR experienced some loss creep related to Hurricane lan (by $27
million, or 0.7 pts on its loss ratio for personal auto and by $3mn or 0.3 pts for Commercial
lines). PGR also experienced thunderstorm losses in the quarter. We had modeled higher loss
creep from Hurricane lan, as our catastrophe loss estimate was $124mn vs. PGR's $44mn.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 132.00
If PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. If PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~25x '23E EPS.
Downside case
USD 90.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~17x '23E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +.05% in Oct. (better than our estimate of -0.4%),
mostly seen in auto agency (-3.6% vs. our -4.6%) followed by auto direct (+3.9% vs. our 3.1%).
As PIF declines remain more evident in agency, we expect PGR's customer mix to continue to
shift toward direct over time. To recap, direct represents 57% of personal auto PIF in Oct. '22.

August and 90.0% in July.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers rose 7.7% over the 12 months from
Oct. 2021 to Oct. 2022. Used car and truck CPI trails all items at +2.0% vs. 7.2% in Sept. Our
focus is on an absolute basis where used car pricing remains significantly elevated (see figure 3).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life
AIG, Inc. (AIG)
Chubb Limited (CB)
Palomar Holdings, Inc. (PLMR)

splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $104 PT is based on 20x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2023E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
