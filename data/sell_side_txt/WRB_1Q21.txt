WRB: Focusing on Price and Exposure; Q1 EPS and Conference Call Round-Up
Our Call
Summary. WRB reported Q1 2021 EPS of $1.08 beating both our estimate of $0.87
and consensus of $0.81. The beat versus us stemmed from more favorable underwriting
results (incluidng a better expense ratio and higher level of favorable reserve develoment)
and stronger alternative investment income. Following WRB's conference call, we are
raising our 2021 EPS estimate to $4.05 from $3.80, while our 2022 and 2023 EPS
estimates are unchanged at $4.75 and $5.45, respectively. We are also maintaining our
price target of $92, which is based on 2.1x our 2022 book value per share estimate.
Shares of WRB should react favorably to the earnings beat and favorable pricing and
margin commentary provided on its conference call.
· Pricing remains in the double-digit but did decelerate sequentially. WRB saw
price increases of 12.8% in the Q1 excluding workers' comp. This does represent a
slowdown from 15.4% in the Q4 and 14.5% in the Q3, but still puts rate well in excess
of loss trend. The slowdown in the rate level sequentially is due to more business
fitting into the rate adequate bucket - given that rate is still in the double digits (we
would put WRB's rate at ~11% including workers' comp) it positions them to continue
to see margin improvement as we move through 2021. Further WRB said that it
expects rate increases to continue to improve given pressures from social inflation and
elevated industry catastrophe losses.
· Stronger submissions and economic improvement called out. WRB pointed to
a pickup in submission flow due to the strong economy and the standard market
pushing more business to the E&S market as they get concerned about their appetite
to write the business. The bullish views on the economy are good for the insurance
brokers (and this data point was also supported by the positive exposure growth seen
by TRV this morning) and the stronger view on the E&S market is a positive sign for
other players in the space, (including ACGL and CB), in our view.
· Underlying margin improvement driven by the expense ratio. The underlying
combined ratio was 88.4% versus our 88.9% estimate due to a better expense ratio,
while the underlying loss ratio of 58.9% (versus our 58.7%) improved by 2.1 points
from last Q1. WRB said it expects to see margin benefits continue in 2021 as it gets
rate on top of rate and in excess of loss trend. WRB is targeting a sub-30% expense
ratio which is better than the around 31.5% they were running at pre Covid-19.
· Premium growth picks up. WRB saw net written premium growth of 11.1% and came
in above our 8.7% estimate and improved from 8.2% in Q4. By segment, insurance net
written premium growth of 9.9% beat or 8.5% estimate and reinsurance growth of
18.2% beat our 10.0% estimate. Going forward the top-line should benefit from the
written price increases as well as audit premiums which should come through either
later this year or early in 2022.
· Workers' comp thoughts. WRB does not want to declare victory too early on the
workers' comp side given the favorable frequency trends, and is therefore not
changing its loss picks at the moment. The company also pointed to workers' comp
should start to bottom by the end of 2021 or by H1 2022.
· Additional color. See inside for additional thoughts on the quarter and please refer to
our initiation on 4/7 for additional thoughts on WRB.

Q1 2021 In A Nutshell
In a nutshell. WRB reported Q1 2021 EPS of $1.08 beating both our estimate of $0.87 and consensus
of $0.81. The beat versus us stemmed from more favorable underwriting results (including a better
expense ratio and higher level of favorable reserve development) and stronger alternative investment
income. Net written premium growth of 11.1% was higher than our 8.7% estimate and picked up
from 8.2% in Q4. The underlying combined ratio of 88.4% beat our 88.9% estimate driven by a better
expense ratio, with the underlying loss ratio coming in just above us (at 58.9% versus our 58.7%
estimate). Catastrophe losses (incl. Covid-19) of $35.8 million added 1.9 points to the combined ratio,
lower than our $50.0 million (2.7 point estimate). Covid-19 losses of $15 million were in-line with our
estimate while cats away from Covid of $20.8 million were lower than our $35.0 million estimate. WRB
repurchased $30 million (0.5 million shares) modestly higher than our $25 million (0.4 million shares)
estimate. The operating ROE was 12.7% and the net income ROE was 14.5%. Book value per share
increased by 1.9% in the Q1.

Additional Pricing Thoughts
Pricing slowed as more business is at adequate levels. WRB saw price increases of 12.8% excluding
workers' comp (they do not provide the price increase with workers' comp until the 10Q comes out
although we estimate that it was around 11% in the Q1). This compares to the 15.4% excluding
workers' comp (13.1% excl. comp) in the Q4 and 14.5% in the Q3 (+12.1% excl. comp). Exhibit 2 below
shows recent commentary that WRB has provided on pricing over the past two plus years. Further
WRB said that while the pricing level (excluding workers' comp) decelerated by 2.6% sequentially in
the quarter this is because more of the portfolio is achieving rate adequate levels and they are pushing
on the exposure side and are less concerned about pushing for more rate within that portion of the
business. WRB did not want to say how much of their business it at rate adequate levels but they did
say that it is a growing portion of the business.
Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period Pricing Comments
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting
meaningful rate increases. And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many
product lines where we have been getting rate on rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that
is very encouraging for what that means for margin.
Q1 2021
The market is clearly in the throes of firming, When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they
think that is very appropriate. And whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001
and 2002 and 2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is, no cycle looks like any other cycle.
When WRB looks at Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers
Q4 2020 compensation, is achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and
necessary. They are seeing meaningful firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess
and umbrella market, while property continues to be notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the
laggards has been primary GL and but over the past couple of quarters that seems to be building some
nomentum.
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are
becoming more acute. As far as workers' compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is
more likely than not to begin to firm as we make our way into 2021 or sometime next year. The loss
Q3 2020 ratios that WRB selected at the beginning of the year assumed that they would not be
outpacing loss cost trend by the level that they are. The rate increases throughout the year, by and
large, are above and beyond what was anticipated. Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and
specifically social inflation, WRB has deliberately decided to take a wait-and-see attitude.
We saw the firm market accelerate throughout 2019 and it continued to accelerate into 2020,
very evident in Q1, The evidence of this was demonstrated, at least in part by business leaving the
standard market, making its way to the specialty market and in particular, the E&S market. Rate
increases were at a level not seen in some number of years and there was a reduction in
Q2 2020 capacity that various carriers were offering, All of these things were being driven by two major
factors: (1) low interest rate environment and a knock-on effect for what that means for investment
income; and (2) loss cost trends, driven to a great extent by social inflation, which had been benign for
an extended period of time and then crept up on the industry when it was least expecting it and it has
proven to be much more of an issue.
Period Pricing Comments
The challenges that the market faces has stemmed from a low interest rate environment, frequency of cat
activity, and social inflation has gotten to the point where it is no longer solely being talked about but it is
actually being acted upon. This is a meaningful sea change that became very visible in the Q4, and
there is no sign of that slowing down, WRB said that they were excited about what was in front of us.
They were enthusiastic earlier in 2019, and the Q4 2019 built on that enthusiasm. Further WRB said that
while there are some that would suggest that they tend to be an optimistic organization, and that is a fair
statement, the data that they see in their business and the data the industry data supports this optimistic
view.
Q4 2019 th
The fear factor is on the rise, If a low interest rate environment and consistent global cat activity over the
past several years wasn't enough, it would seem as though social inflation is finally coming into focus
for the broader audience. People are beginning to realize that it is real and it is here. Frequency of severity
can no longer be ignored, both in the property space, but even more so in the casualty space.
Q3 2019 P
We are seeing rate increases across the board with the exception of workers' comp, which certainly
is the one major product line moving in the other direction. Granted, all these other product lines and the
rates they're getting, they're not moving up all in perfect lockstep, but directionally WRB was pleased to see
Q2 2019 things moving in a positive direction. Further WRB saw an increasing number of examples of business getting
kicked out of the standard market and making its way into the specialty/E&S market and in addition to that
an increasing demand for facultative reinsurance, These are all historically signs or classic indicators of a
firming market particularly when you have all of these pieces lining up the way they seem to be.
Ex comp, WRB achieved 6.4% rate increase. WRB achieved this with its renewal retention ratio remaining at
a similar level to what it was over the past several years, From WRB's perspective, with the exception of
Q1 2019 workers' compensation, every major commercial business line is in some point of firming, All
product lines do not march in perfect lockstep with one another, but from WRB's perspective directionally,
they are moving together, with comp being the exception.
Q1 2020
Rate increases that continue to progress in response to past conversations around social
inflation and keeping up with loss costs.

Read-Throughs From WRB Earnings
See below for an overview of read-throughs across our coverage following WRB's Q1 2021 earnings.
. Rate increases should benefit other commercial line names in Q1 and beyond. WRB pointed to
seeing continued rate increases in the Q1 with rates up 13% ex-workers' comp. Coupled with the
positive pricing commentary from TRV, other commercial line names should see margin benefits
from a hardening market in the Q1. In addition, WRB pointed to rate increases persisting (and
remaining above loss trend) throughout 2021, which should also bode well for commercial line
margins this year and perhaps into 2022.
· Stronger submissions and economic improvement. WRB pointed to a pickup in submission flow
due to the strong economy and due to the standard market pushing more business to the E&S
market as they get concerned about their appetite to write the business. The bullish views on the
economy are good for the insurance brokers (and this data point was also supported by the
positive exposure growth seen by TRV this morning) and the stronger view on the E&S market
is a positive sign for other players in the space (including ACGL and CB), in our view.
· It saves to be more efficient. WRB pointed to targeted a sub-30% expense ratio compared to the
around 30.5% they were running at pre Covid-19 and to the 29.5% in the current quarter (which
saw around 50 basis points of savings from Covid-19). We think the better expense ratio reflects
perhaps some Covid-19 savings persisting and also the expectation that the top-line growth
should pick-up which would also help the expense ratio, This could be a sign that perhaps expense
ratios across the group end up at a better level post-Covid when compared to pre-Covid levels.
. Covid-19 loss totals starting to slow. WRB posted $15 million of Covid-19 related losses in the
Q1, in-line with our estimate and down from $28 million in Q4. The relatively low losses from WRB
ties to our overall thought that Covid-19 related losses should slow for P&C insurers in the Q1
relative to other quarters of 2020.
· Alternatives outperformed in the Q1. Similar to TRV, alternative investments outperformed at
WRB and we would expect this to be a common theme for insurers (both non-life and life insurers)
this earnings season.
Additional Thoughts On The Quarter
See below for an overview of additional thoughts on Q1 2021 earnings versus our estimates.
· Premium growth above us. Gross written premium growth of 11.4% beat our 8.8% estimate
(and improved from +9.3% in Q4) and net written premium growth of 11.1% also came in above
our 8.7% estimate (and improved from 8.2% in Q4). By segment, insurance net written premium
growth of 9.9% beat or 8.5% estimate and reinsurance growth of 18.2% beat our 10.0% estimate.
Earned premium growth of 9.4% was also above our 8.5%.
. NII beat on stronger alternatives. Net investment income of $158.6 million was ahead of our
$131.2 million estimate due to stronger alternative investment income than our forecast. Core
portfolio income of $100.6 million was just below our $101.9 million estimate, while investment
funds of $38.9 million was ahead of our $16.3 million and arbitrage trading accounts of $19.1
million was also above our $12.9 million estimate. The investment yield on the core portfolio was
2.02%, or down 7 bps from the 2.09% in the Q4 and also down from the 2.22% in the Q3.
. Other revenues come in below us. Revenues from non-insurance businesses was $87.4 million
versus our $92.5 million estimate (although non-insurance expenses also came in below us),
insurance service fees was $25.8 million ahead of our $23.0 million estimate, and other income of
$0.3 million just missed our $0.5 million estimate.
. Combined ratio ahead on lower cat losses and better expense ratio. The combined ratio of 90.1%
beat our 91.6% estimate. The insurance combined ratio was 90.6% relative to our 91.7% estimate
and the reinsurance combined ratio of 87.4% also came in lower than our 90.8% estimate. The
loss ratio was 60.6% versus our 61.4% estimate, while the expense ratio of 29.5% beat our 30.2%
estimate and WRB pointed to target a sub-30 expense ratio even when we come out of Covid-19
(with Covid-19 having benefited its expense ratio by about 50 basis points). Catastrophe losses
including Covid-19 of $35.8 million (1.9 points) were below our $50 million (2.7 points) estimate,
while reserve releases of $4 million (0.2 points) were ahead of our $1 million (0.1 points) estimate.
Catastrophe losses included $15 million of Covid-19 related losses, similar to our $15 million
estimate.
· Underlying results beat us on better expense ratio, loss ratio just higher than us. The underlying
combined ratio was 88.4% versus our 88.9% estimate, due to a stronger than forecasted expense
ratio, while the underlying loss ratio of 58.9% just missed our 58.7% estimate, but did improve

W.R. Berkley Corporation
by 1.6 points from last Q1. We do not get underlying ratios by segment until the filing of the
company's 10-Q/10-K filings.
· Capital return just above us. WRB repurchased 0.5 million shares for $30 million, which was ahead
of our 0.4 million shares for $25 million estimate, but down modestly from $34.5 million in Q4.
Including dividends, total capital return was $51 million, or 25.3% of operating earnings of $201.8
million.
Summary Of Estimate Changes
See below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q1 2021 earnings. We are raising our
2021 EPS estimate to $4.05 from $3.80 mostly to reflect the stronger Q1 2021 earnings results
versus our prior estimate. We are maintaining our 2022 and 2023 EPS estimates of $4.75 and $5.45,
respectively.

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for WRB: $92.00 from NC
Our price target of $92 is based on a 2.1x multiple of our year-end 2022 book value estimate. Our price target also represents a 19.3x
multiple against our 2022 EPS estimate.
Risk for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe and/or Covid-19 losses.
Investment Thesis
WRB
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases
in 2021 which should translate into underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is currently reflected in consensus
expectations.
