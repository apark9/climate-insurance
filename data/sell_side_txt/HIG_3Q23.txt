3Q23 Earnings Review: Best in class
commercial underlying loss ratio
Group benefits record quarterly core earnings. Best in class
commercial underlying loss ratio of 57.1% (3.5pts and 4.0pts
better than TRV and CB, respectively) & commercial ex WC
pricing remains above loss trends. While auto continues to be a
drag on results, we saw q/q improvements and a near 20%
increase in pricing.

Our key focus is on overall profitability. We expect continued improvements in underlying
margin expansion (HIG believes commercial ex WC pricing remains on top of lost cost trends),
especially as HIG grows property writings where we think rate is more robust than other lines.
Still, we anticipate a slightly higher cat load from commercial property growth, less favorable
PYD as WC margins erode over time and its A&E ADC limits beginning to exhaust (some recovery
in 4Q24 and no recovery in 4Q25.) Still, auto robust rate increases are encouraging (will take
longer to earn in on 12 month policies) and group disability is a standout. Likewise,
NII continues to grow, especially from higher premium leverage. PT to $85.
Loss Cost Trends: On the WC side, medical severity trends have been lower than the 5% per its
pricing/reserving assumptions. We are expecting the loss cost environment to moderately
worsen going forward; there will likely be new catalysts for the industry to push for further rate
increases.

Profitable growth areas: 1.) Commercial property to approach $2.5bn of premiums this year,
we estimate representing ~20% of total commercial premiums. HIG's underweight position in
commercial property and its YTD catastrophe loss experience below its market share makes
increased catastrophe exposure manageable. Still, we are raising our estimated cat load
slightly. 2.) Small commercial premiums to approach $5bn in FY23, a 9% increase y/y. Within
small commercial, E&S premiums to near $200mn for FY23, while serving as a boost is not at
scale in our view. Small commercial underlying combined ratio reached a trough at 83.9% back
in 3Q21, has risen in recent quarters standing at 89.7% in 3Q23, although still strong. 3.) Group
benefits ongoing premium growth of 8% driven by strong persistency, new business, and higher
exposures.

Middle Market NPW up 5% y/y, a slower pace than 8% commercial NPW growth y/y. While
exposure growth is positive, it is less robust than in 1H23, as seen by audit premiums. Middle
market may become a more competitive environment (i.e. CB grew NPW 16.3% in middle
market in 3Q y/y). HIG's discipline is intact as middle market & large commercial underlying

combined ratio is at 88.1% (improved 5.6 pts y/y) and is better than small commercial at
89.7% (although middle & large margins had benefited from favorable property losses.)
Favorable PYD of $43mn mostly driven by WC and package releases somewhat offset by GL. On
the latter, HIG is not seeing anything indicative of a new trend, a couple of large umbrella losses
and one large national account spread over several years. TRV and CB also took GL reserve
charges in the 3Q print. HIG conducts its asbestos review every 4Q. In our 4Q22 earnings
note we wrote that HIG could see some ADC recovery in 2024 with full gross A&E losses
materializing in core earnings starting in 2025. (We are modeling $120mn of net adverse PYD in
4Q24 and $169mn in 4Q25, respectively.) We think HIG has a buffer in its WC reserves that could
fortify its reserve position.

Why OVERWEIGHT?
HIG has sound fundamentals
following transformation, which
should continue to drive a stronger
book multiple. ROE convergence
with peers should make current
valuation look inexpensive.
Navigators acquisition is becoming
more accretive given boost from
hard pricing in specialty lines. HIG
has accelerated the pace of its
expense savings plans.
Upside case
USD 95.00
Our upside case reflects stronger
than expected underwriting margin
expansion and commercial P&C
pricing levels and improving group
benefits margins. Our upside case is
~1.5x '24 BVPS ex AOCI.
Downside case
USD 65.00
Our downside case assumes
unsuccessful underwriting margin
expansion and expense savings as
well as a slowdown in the
commercial P&C renewal rate
environment and recessionary
pressures. Our downside case is
1.0x '24 BVPS ex AOCI.

Personal Lines - Rates, Underlying Margins, and PIF
Auto rates. HIG achieved auto pricing increases of 19.7% in 3Q23 (from 13.7% in 2Q23) and
expect similar rate increases in 4Q. HIG reiterated achieving targeted profitability in early
'25. We believe both written rates and approved rates will take time to earn in, especially
considering that the bulk of HIG's policies are 12 months (though more recent marketing efforts
for Prevail are centered on 6-month policies).
Auto underlying combined ratio improved sequentially to 108.5% in 3Q23 from 111.8% in
2Q23, although deteriorated vs. 102.6% in 3Q22. While auto is a drag on results, HIG's balanced
business mix and niche type of focus on AARP means it is less weighted on auto.
Homeowners rates. HIG continues to push for rate with a 14.1% written rate increase in 3Q23
(down from 14.4% last quarter) that is the combination of higher rate and inflation guard. HIG
believes its homeowners pricing is better than lost trends.
Homeowners underlying combined ratio was within HIG's expectations improving to 78.1% in
3Q23 from 79.6% in 2Q23 and improved from 80.4% in 3Q22.
The underlying loss ratio for Personal Lines decreased to 74.7% in 3Q23 from 76.1% in 2Q23,
although up from 70.5% in 1Q23 and 68.8% in 3Q22. The expense ratio improved by 2.9 pts y/y
due to lower marketing spend.
Policies in Force (PIF) slightly down. PIF declined (1.3)% q/q for Auto (vs. down 1.4% q/q last
quarter) and (1.5)% for Homeowners (down 1.1% q/q last quarter). We view this PIF decline in
auto positively as it means HIG is not actively growing a loss leading LOB.

Commercial Lines pricing ex workers' compensation (WC) is accelerating slightly to 8.0% in
3Q23 from 7.5% in 2Q23 and 6.8% in 1Q23. Commercial lines pricing inc. Property pricing is up

positive while public D&O pricing remains challenged. While WC pricing pressures persist, HIG is
expecting continued improvements from frequency trends. Medical severity is performing
better than HIG's loss picks.

Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio of 87.8% (0.5 point improvement q/q and 1.5
point deterioration y/y) is at the middle of management's full-year 2023 guidance range of
87%-89%. Broken down by segment:
· Middle & Large Commercial underlying combined ratio of 88.1% in 3Q23 improved by 5.6 pts
y/y.
· Small Commercial underlying combined ratio at 89.7% in 3Q23 deteriorated 1.2pts y/y.
· Global Specialty underlying combined ratio of 84.3% in 3Q23 improved 0.2pts y/y. Property
pricing has been >20% YTD, and international casualty is >10%.
Outlook: Business mix is shifting, with more commercial property writings we may see
improved underlying margins in our view, though cat loads should increase somewhat.

YTD3Q23 vs. FY2023 Target Financial Plan
We track YTD3Q23 progression against full-year 2023 guidance:
· HIG's personal lines underlying CR of 99.3% in YTD3Q23. In April, management implied a
higher guide for underlying combined ratio in FY2023 than what it shared in February
(of 93%-95%) with the auto loss ratio potentially rising 4 to 6 pts higher than management's
target for the full year.
· Commercial lines underlying CR of 88.2% in YTD3Q23 was at the high end of the 2023 guide
of 87%-89%.
· Group Benefits core earnings margin for YTD3Q23 came in at 7.6%, above the company's
6%-7% target range for 2023.
· Core ROE of 14.9% vs. management's 14-15% target for 2023. We forecast 14.5% for 2023 and
14.8% for 2024.

Forward-Looking Commentary/Model Updates
· Small commercial premiums to approach $5bn in FY23, a 9% increase y/y. Within small
commercial, E&S premiums to near $200mn for FY23.
· Commercial property premiums approaching $2.5bn for FY23 or a 25% y/y increase. As such,
we raised our commercial at load expectations by 25bps in our forecast period.
· Commercial ex WC pricing remains on top of lost cost trends, reinforcing HIG's confidence of
achieving margin expansion for 2023.
· Personal auto pricing increases of nearly 20% in 3Q - should continue in 4Q. In 4Q, HIG
expects to achieve auto new business rate adequacy in over half the states, representing two-
thirds of new business premium. HIG reiterated achieving auto profitability by 2025.

· Personal lines seasonality: Auto underlying combined ratio in 4Q tends to be 6-8 pts worse
than YTD3Q, conversely, homeowners underlying combined ratio in 4Q tends to be 5-6 pts

· HIG expects FY23 yield ex LPs to be 80bps better than FY22; FY24 should be 25bps better than
FY23.
· Buybacks: $350mn in 4Q23E, same as 3Q23.

on a 50/50 weighted 9.5x (unchanged) '24E EPS and 1.3x (unchanged) 2024E book value per
share ex AOCI.
3Q23 Variance
Core EPS. Operating EPS of $2.29 beat our $1.86 estimate and beat consensus estimate of
$1.97, driven by better catastrophe losses, NII and core group benefits margin vs. our estimates.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $85 price target on HIG is based on a 50/50 weighted 9.5x '24E EPS and 1.3x 2024E book value per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.

information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
