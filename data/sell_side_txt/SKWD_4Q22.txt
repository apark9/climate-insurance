4Q22 Review: Tilting "Skyward"
SKWD is off to a good start in its first reporting season as a
public company. We can envision greater upside for the stock as
long as we continue to see GWP growth, improvements in its
AYLR and no adverse PYD.

Our first impressions of the 4Q print were better than expected expense ratio and higher NII.
Following the earnings call, we gained greater clarity of its ceded Re strategy where SKWD is
weighing in the merits of reinsurance by each risk class and is not constrained. While Global
Property GWP was a lesser standout than other business classes this quarter, we expect to see
more momentum through the course of the year. The degree of AYLR improvements from here
will predicate upon rates remaining ahead of loss trend, which SKWD is still seeing, just not at
the same high watermark as 2-3 quarters ago.

Rates vs. Loss trends: Pure rates in high single digits are "meaningfully" above loss cost
inflation. Pricing came up a few ticks in 4Q22 vs 3Q22.
Mid teens submission flow y/y.
Premium Growth >35% is select segments: Transactional E&S, professional lines, captives
and Surety divisions. Transactional E&S remains a greenfield operation for SKWD, as it is not at
scale yet, expect hyper growth to continue. SKWD is scaling up its surety business, in which it
acquired Aegis Surety in 2021. Captive business (where a large portion of risk is self-insured) is
chunky/more opportunsitic. Finally, on professional lines, SKWD does not play a heavy hand
within the public D&O space, it is holding the line into 2022. SKWD is finding miscellaneous
classes of professional lines business to be attractive on a risk-adjusted return basis, like
cannabis.

Ceded Re Strategy: At 1/1 renewals, SKWD entered into a whole account QS treaty for
commercial auto with some optionality on changing the structures of its the portfolio specific
auto liability reinsurance covers during 2H23. On the flipside, at 1/1, SKWD elected to retain
more XOL professional lines risk. SKWD's reinsurance renewals are staggered throughout the
year, we expect to hear more iterations. 5/1 is SKWD's large cat reinsurance renewal. With a
larger balance sheet post IPO raise, we think SKWD could retain more risk when it finds it more
compelling to do so on an economic basis. SKWD is expecting lower net retained premium for
1Q-2Q23. On a seasonality perspective, net premium retention is lower in 1H and higher in 2H.
SKWD is not seeing a compression in ceding commissions since its IPO launch nor is it expecting
pressure in 2023. We would not rule out some compression. Quota share heavy businesses are
Global Property and Captives.

Why OVERWEIGHT?
E&S writers trade at a premium to
admitted writers. SKWD's multiple
could increase over time as the E&S
becomes a larger piece of their
overall mix from its current ~50%,
achievable within transactional E&S
and property. SKWD's stock
performance could hinge more on
execution than peers given a
shorter operating history under the
current management team.
Upside case
USD 24.00
Over time, multiple expansion
could come from the shift of
business mix towards the E&S
market and we expect underwriting
profitability to improve in
2023/2024. Our upside case of $24 is
based on a ~12x P/E '24 and 1.6x
TBVPS for common shareholders ex
AOCI '24.
Downside case
USD 18.00
A slowdown in the E&S market and
unforeseen reserving issues from
their LPT transaction could lead to
sentiment risk compared to peers.
Our downside case of $18 is based
on a ~9x P/E '24 and 1.2x TBVPS for
common shareholders ex AOCI '24.

4Q22 Highlights
Operating earnings Beat: SKWD reported 4Q22 adjusted net operating earnings of $11.6mn
which was better than our estimate of $10.9mn. The beat was driven by better than expected
net investment income.
1 March 2023

Barclays | Skyward Specialty Insurance Group, Inc.
4Q22 GWP growth: SKWD GWP grew/declined by 18.1% y/y (vs. our 18.6% estimate). SKWD"s
continuing business GWP was up 21.4% y/y vs. our estimated 22.3%.
According to Andrew Robinson, CEO: "We continue to realize strong pure rate in excess of
expected loss cost trends, and our double-digit growth in each and every one of our eight
underwriting divisions during 2022 provides us a terrific launch point for continued growth and
margin expansion in 2023."
We think SKWD's greatest opportunity for premium growth is within its transactional E&S and
Global property segments.
Better than expected Expense Ratio: SKWD's expense ratio in 4Q22 of 28.4% was below its
3Q22 result of 29.1% and better than our estimate of 29.1%. Underwriting performance: SKWD
combined ratio was 92.4% vs. our estimate of 93.3%. AYLR (ex LPT and non-LPT) was 63.2% vs.
our estimated 63.3%. Total company AYCR ex cats was 91.6% vs. our 92.4% estimate, also ex
LPT and non-LPT.
SKWD reported $5.3mn of net investment income vs. our estimate of $4mn. The average
duration fo assets is 4 years and SKWD's reinvestment rate is 5% on its core fixed income
portfolio. We had expected SKWD's NII contribution from its opportunistic fixed income to be a
greater drag to overall NII. SKWD's opportunistic fixed income piece hurt overall NII by $2.3mn
and its core fixed income portfolio yield was 3.7% in 4Q22 vs. 2.2% in 4Q22.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Greater variability of net investment income
stemming from its "opportunistic fixed income fund" (i.e. 19% of its investment portfolio and 60% of NII for YTD3Q22). This fund is originated and
managed by Arena, another Westaim subsidiary. Albeit, SKWD is winding down the opportunistic fixed income fund. Higher dependence on
reinsurance than established peers. SKWD is not immune to the secular challenges posed by the commercial auto insurance market (25% DPW for
YTD3Q22). SKWD was able to achieve sub 30% GWP growth in its core businesses over the last 2 years, with a notable step down in growth to sub 10%

funding future growth or back filling historical growth that had already consumed statutory capitalization.
