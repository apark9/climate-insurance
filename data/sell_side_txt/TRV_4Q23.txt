TRV: Opening the Umbrella; Conference Call Roundup
Our Call
TRV shares traded up dramatically on the day as they beat on the bottom and top line
and saw the strongest BI margins on record. Although we see it as a good print, we do not
view the level of BI underlying margin improvement as sustainable.
The stock from here: Travelers shares responded well to the strong underlying results.
While we recognize it was one good quarter, we are not modeling for the level of BI
underlying margin improvement to persist in 2024. Our numbers move up by 5% in
2024 (as higher underwriting income is counter-balanced by modestly lower investment
income), and as a result we view the shares as adequately valued (1.93x 12/31 BV and
10.7x our 24 EPS estimate) post the move today.
Estimate and price target changes:Our 2024 EPS estimate goes to $19.30 (from
$18.45), 2025 EPS goes to $21.05 (from $20.80), and we introduce an initial 2026 EPS
estimate of $22.90. Our estimates reflect better underwriting results, which more than
offset modestly lower investment income (our quarterly fixed/short-term investment
income ranges from $632-678M in 2024 relative to the $630-675M revised guidance).
Our price target is now $211 (from $182) based on 10x our 2025 EPS estimate.
Read thrus: (1) underlying margins could be strong for the group in Q4 (although it is
unclear what the benefit of non-cat weather was for TRV), (2) cats should be muted as
TRV saw extremely low losses, (3) other companies could seek to get more reinsurance
protection as they can offset the higher costs with continued price, and (4) reserves
continue to pose a risk, especially for the soft market years as TRV added more to its GL
and umbrella reserves (the level of which was not quantified).
BI underlying margin: The BI underlying CR improved 2.7 points Y/Y due to the higher
earned pricing, a mix shift to property, and impact from non-cat weather which was
modestly favorable to both the prior year and their expectations. When asked if the
better BI margin is sustainable moving forward, they did not want to provide specific
guidance. We are not expecting the 2.0 points of improvement we saw in '23 to persist in
2024 and are looking for 20bps of margin deterioration in '24.
Reserves: Travelers saw overall reserve strengthening and overall net favorable
development within Business Insurance. With that being said, the company did add to its
general liability and umbrella reserves, which was more than offset by releases in workers'
compensation resulting in overall favorable development of $56M in BI. We expect
reserve movements within casualty lines to be in focus as we move through earnings
season. Other: See inside for highlights of key issues for TRV.

Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the hard
commercial market as pricing should continue to have legs given
inflation and higher weather volatility. Although we are positive on
the commercial lines space as a whole, we are Equal Weight TRV due
to its smaller account exposure, higher workers' comp focus as both
are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes, and personal
lines exposure, particularly auto, which is well above target margins
of mid-90s.

Base Case | $211.00
. Our price target of $211 is based on just
over 10x our 2025 EPS estimate.
· Implies around a ~1.6x multiple of our
projected 2025 book value estimate of
~$136.
Upside Scenario | $232.00
. Our upside scenario is $232 and
assumes a multiple of ~12x our 2025
EPS estimate and 1.85x our 2025 book
value estimate of ~$136.
· A continued firm commercial pricing
environment with no material changes
to loss cost trends
. No material reserve builds
· Catastrophe losses returning to
normalized levels
· Share repurchase also returning to
normalized levels in 2024
Downside Scenario | $158.00
. Our downside scenario is $158 and is
based on 7.5x our 2025 EPS estimate
and over 1.16x our 2025 book value
estimate of ~$136.
· Commercial pricing softens causing the
RRC in BI to slow
. Loss cost trends rise, and we see further
additions to reserves
· Personal lines loss trends get worse,
causing TRV to push for another round
of elevated rate increases
Upcoming Catalysts
+ Commercial pricing survey data from MarketScout and Ivans to
track movement in rate across various commercial lines, including
workers' compensation
+ Commentary from other peers around loss cost trends and rate
adequacy in lines including commercial and personal insurance lines

What the Companies Are Saying-TRV
Outlook
Overall, Travelers said they were confident with how they are positioned for 2024 and beyond. The
company did not want to provide much in the way of future margins, but did say that their view of
pricing and loss trend has not really changed. Further, the quota share with Fidelis was renewed for
2024 and is expected to provide a modest benefit to underlying margins.
Pricing
Renewal rate change (RRC) slowed to 7.4% (from 7.8% in Q3) reflective of a lower percentage of
National Property written premium in Q4 (16.8% of premiums vs 19.1% in Q3). TRV highlighted that
they saw meaningful rate increases in all lines other than workers' comp, with the strongest increases
in property, umbrella and auto. Within casualty, the RRCs in all lines were comparable or better than
the Q3. With National Property, rates did decelerate in the quarter given the strong returns of the
business, but TRV said both the RRC and RPC remain strong.
Guidance
Guidance provided by TRV includes:
· Fixed income/short-term investment guide lowered: TRV updated its guidance for fixed income
and short-term investment income for 2024. TRV is now looking for fixed income and short-
term investment income to be around $2.6 billion after-tax for FY 2024, which is down from prior
guidance for more than $2.6 billion. The guide assumes quarterly NII ranging from $630-675
million, down from the prior guide of $630-690 million.
. Expense ratio guidance: The overall expense ratio should be in the range of 28-28.5% for FY 2024.
. Personal lines RPC guide: Within personal auto, the RPC should remain in the mid-teens through
H1 as they continue to seek rates on a state-by-state basis. Within home, the RPC should
moderate to the low-double-digits in 2024 as TRV will continue to seek rates in response to
elevated losses, but their automatic increase in limit factors will return to more normal levels,
reflective of progress they have made with aligning insured values and replacement costs.
. Share buyback view for Q1: TRV expects buybacks to be around $250 million in Q1 (vs. VA
consensus of $380m and our previous fcst of $450m) as the capital strategy is unchanged but
balances the need to use capital for growth and the recent Corvus deal.
Highlights of TRV's call included
commentary around pricing (in
BI and PI), reserve movements,
and its underlying loss ratio in BI.
Guidance was given around: (1)
fixed income investment income,
(2) expense ratio, (3) personal
lines RPC , and (4) expected
buyback for Q1 2024.
Investments
Travelers updated its outlook for after-tax investment income from fixed income and short-term
investments to range from $630 million in Q1 2024 to $675 million in Q4.
Liquidity and Capital
TRV has $1.5 billion of capital at the holding company (up from just under $1.5 billion at the end of
2022, but down when compared to $1.7B at end of Q3) with all of their capital ratios at or better than
target levels. They did say that they have a modest improvement in capital from the new S&P capital
model. Overall, the capital strategy is unchanged, and Travelers will look to balance capital for top-
line growth as well as the $435m deployed for the Corvus deal (deal closed on 1/2/24). As a result of
these dynamics, they now expect to buy back $250 million in Q1 2024. TRV has $6.0B left under its
repurchase authorization as of 12/31.

Overview of our estimate changes. The exhibit below highlights the changes we made to our earnings
model following Q4 2023 earnings.
· 2024 EPS goes up to $19.30 (from $18.45) to reflect better margins (loss and expense), primarily
in Bl and auto and higher premium growth, partially offset by lower buybacks and a higher tax rate.
· 2025 EPS goes up to $21.05 (from $20.80) to reflect better margins (loss and expense), primarily
in BI and auto and higher premium growth, partially offset by lower buybacks and a higher tax rate.
. We introduce a 2026 EPS of $22.90.

Business Insurance Rating Environment-RRC Down; Exposure Slows Modestly
. In Q4, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +7.4%, a deceleration from the +7.8% in
the prior quarter which was attributed to a lower concentration of National Property in the quarter.
Exposure growth was up 4.4%, down from the 5.2% in Q3, but remaining at strong levels. The
11.8% of RPC in Q4 was down from the record-high 13.0% we saw in the prior quarter. The exhibits

Pricing Highlights-Personal Lines
Personal Lines-TRV Sees Rate Slow in Auto and Accelerate in Home, Margins Improve in Both
Segments
· Within Personal Auto, TRV saw renewal premium change decelerate sequentially to 16.7% from
18.2% in the previous quarter; however, their auto underlying margin remained above 100% for the
seventh straight quarter (102.7% in Q4) but this did improve 790 basis points Y/Y. The underlying
margin was down 210bps sequentially, which is seasonality as the Q4 is usually 6-7 points worse
Q/Q. They expect personal auto RPC to be in the mid-teens through the first half of 2024, and
pointed out that the majority of their auto book reached written rate adequacy in the Q4.
. Homeowners' RPC accelerated sequentially to a new record-high 21.2% from the previous record-
high 19.2% in Q3. They expect RPC to moderate to the low double-digits in 2024.
. Auto PIFs flat sequentially, while home was down 1%. Travelers' new business in auto increased
7% Y/Y to $288 million, after also decreasing 7% Y/Y last quarter and marked the first quarter since
Q3 2022 to see a sequential increase. Auto PIFs were flat sequentially (modestly better than the

Valuation
Current valuation. The TRV shares are now trading at 1.93x Q4 2023 book value, which is above its 5-
year (1.49x) average, and its 10-year (1.43x) average multiple but below the peak level of 2.05x. The
P/B multiple continues to be elevated as reported book value has higher unrealized losses on TRV's
investment portfolio vs. historical averages; when excluding unrealized losses (net), shares are currently
trading at 1.61x Q4 adjusted book of $128.78, which is just above the 1.37x 5-year average ex AOCI.
On a price-to-earnings basis, the shares are trading at 10.7x our 2024 EPS and 9.8x our 2025 estimate
versus the 5-year average of 11.6x, 10-year average of 11.5x and the 5-year and 10-year peak of
14.2x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the hard commercial market as pricing should continue to have legs given inflation and
higher weather volatility. Although we are positive on the commercial lines space as a whole, we are Equal Weight TRV due to its smaller
account exposure, higher workers' comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes, and personal lines exposure,
particularly auto, which is well above target margins of mid-90s.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $211.00 from $182.00
. Our price target of $211 is based on just over 10x our 2025 EPS estimate.
· Implies around a ~1.6x multiple of our projected 2025 book value estimate of ~$136.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and reported / underlying margins coming in better
than expected.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
