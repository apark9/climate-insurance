AIG, Inc.
4Q22 Earnings: Can AIG rejuvenate
growth in '23?
NPW declined (5.9)%, constant dollar +1.4%. Ramping up
growth in '23 would largely depend on portfolio construction
and pricing conditions. AIG's Validus and Lexington arms
provide the group an edge. It remains to be seen if that can
counterbalance headwinds within financial lines pricing.

Lexington Growth Engine: We reviewed statutory filings, Lexington's DPW increased 16% from
LTM 3Q22 vs. LTM 3Q21 yet that is lower than the overall E&S market at 26% on the same basis.
Lexington remains the #2 E&S writer based on 3Q22 DPW. We think AIG will play catch up in 2023
as it is well through figuring out what is a Lexington policy vs. a retail policy.

50 bps Compression NA Commercial Pricing vs. Loss Trend: Pure pricing +3% plus exposure
growth of 3% sums up to 6% written pricing increases, 50 bps below AIG's 6.5% loss trend
expectation (unchanged from 3Q22). This is a worse outlook than CB (6.5% pricing vs. 6.5% loss
trend). However, AIG is constructive that pricing is reaccelerating heading into the new year.
Retail property up 24% in Dec and a similar lift in Lexington. Strong reinsurance cat rate
increases, up 30-100%, at Validus Re.

We anticipate GI underwriting margin expansion from here will come more from the expense
ratio side and from PCG remediation. The formation of Syndicate 2019 was AIG's first stab at
sharing PCG risk with a third party. Since the inception of that arrangement in 2020, PCG results
have been disappointing. AIG's next venture with Stone Point is another stab. If the ultimate
goal is for AIG to act more like a fronting company and earn fee income, then we can better see
contributions from AIG's better performing commercial lines segments.
Favorable PYD: While other commercial lines writers saw PYD erosion within casualty this
quarter, a piece of AIG's higher than typical favorable PYD this quarter was due to NA casualty. In
contrast, just focusing on casualty reserves (not overall PYD), TRV strengthened GL, primarily
umbrella for multiple AYs, reserves amid inflationary pressures in more losses reaching excess
layers of coverage. MKL experienced adverse PYD on certain GL and professional lines for AYs
2016-2019 as the impacts of economic and social inflation have created more uncertainty on
longer tail lines.

Path to ROCE in double digits: We are assuming the stating point is 6/7% adj. ROCE. It is
important to keep in mind that when AIG talks about achieving double digit ROCEs, that
reference is on a deconsolidated entity not a 2023/2024 outlook on the current structure where
AIG remains a majority owner of CRBG. We think AIG's goal of improving ROCE by 300-400 bps is
achievable, the question is the timeline. AIG anticipates higher interest rates adds another 100-
200 bps to its sustainable long term ROCE outlook. The last piece is not unique to AIG, if the rest
of the P&C industry can also add 1-2 pts to ROCE from higher interest rates, that shift would be
in parallel to others. Then AIG, as a pure P&C insurer, would still have a ROCE that lags its peers.

50 bps Compression NA Commercial Pricing vs. Loss
Trend
NA Commercial rates grew to +3% in 4Q22 vs +7% in 2Q22 and +8% in 1Q22. We only have AIG's
NA commercial pricing of 9% ex WC for 3Q22, obscuring q/q comparables. The drag to rates is on
the financial lines and WC sides. 4Q rates ex financial lines was +7% and +9% ex financial lines
and WC.
Pure pricing +3% plus exposure growth of 3% sums up to 6% written pricing increases, 50 bps
below AlGs 6.5% loss trend expectation (unchanged from 3Q22). This is worse than CB's
equilibrium of 6.5% pricing and loss trend. However, AIG is constructive that pricing is
reaccelerating heading into the new year. Retail property up 24% in Dec and a similar lift in
Lexington. Strong reinsurance cat rate increases, up 30-100%, at Validus Re. CB thinks that
"additional rate is required primarily to keep pace with loss costs, which again are hardly benign
in both long-tail and short-tail lines". Implying that loss trend may rise from here, even though
CB takes a current and prospective view of trend. As loss trend is not static, we would have to
evaluate the pace of rate increases relative to any changes in loss trends to be more
constructive on improvements in NA Commercial Lines AYLR.
Where we take some pause on premium growth from here: During the 3Q22 earnings call, AIG
mentioned putting more capital to work for underwriting capacity yet premium growth - even
ex FX - has been less robust. AIG was able to grow in prior periods without that same assertion
of deploying more capital for underwriting.

1/1 Reinsurance Update
Overall reinsurance costs increased <10% on an absolute and risk adjusted basis versus 2022.
AIG stands out relative to its peer group in terms of lower property catastrophe attachment
points. AIG is happy with its reinsurance placements, therefore its ceded reinsurance strategy
does not limit the company to grow in businesses where it sees attractive risk adjusted returns.
We point out that while AIG manages its property catastrophe risk relative to capital by legal
entity, S&P takes an enterprise view of capital. We think that AIG's catastrophe risk charge to
S&P capital had benefited from a larger balance sheet that included life operations. With a
smaller balance sheet, post separation, we see its PML growth to be more constrained.
We share noteworthy changes:
16 February 2023
5
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
Reinsurance updates: more per occurrence protection less aggregate protection. With less
aggregate cover, AIG could be subject to multiple reinstatement premiums if 2023 shapes up to
be a frequent cat year. There was less reinsurance capacity/appetite for aggregate cover at 1/1
renewals. AIG felt like it was not getting the appropriate risk-adjusted returns if it renewed last
year's aggregate limit. On a severity standpoint, AIG purchased more per occurrence limit in
'23 vs. '22 to protect against higher risk return periods.
2023 worldwide aggregate property catastrophe program protection decreased to $500mn
from $1.1bn in 2022. We do not know yet any changes to retentions, to recap it was $400mn for
2022. The second event attachment is an improvement over last year.
Dissaggregation of NA Commercial and Personal shared limits: Last year's occurrence XOL
treaty was a shared limit between commercial and personal lines. This year, limits are not
shared and AIG reduced the total limit of PCG catastrophe program. On a frequency standpoint,
commercial only NA per occurrence protection retentions increased to $500mn from last year's
$250mn (except Southeast/Gulf at $500mn) and Lexington attaching at $300mn (lack of y/y
comparison). We also assume that Lexington is writing more personal lines risk on non-
admitted paper that is subject to this attachment level. Still, very low attachment points vs.
companies of comparable sizes.
Rest of the world regional tower: Japan per occurrence protection attachment of $200mn is
unchanged y/y, Rest of World per occurrence protection attachment at $125mn in '23 is slightly
up from $100mn in '22.
Casualty treaties (XOL and QS) renewed close to expiring terms (on a risk-adjusted basis) and no
change on ceding commissions. In contrast, Validus Re business saw 1-2 pts of favorable ceding
commissions on casualty QS treaties.
Validus Re: 1/1 renewals added $500mn of incremental premiums y/y.
ROCE Expansion
It is important to keep in mind that when AIG talks about achieving double digit ROCEs, that
reference is on a deconsolidated entity not a 2023/2024 outlook on the current structure where
AIG remains a majority owner of CRBG. We think it can take many years for AIG to fully
deconsolidate CRBG, sure it will continue accessing the public markets at the end of each lock in
period, however, these offerings may be small chunks along the way.
We are assuming that the adjusted ROCE starting point in AIG's path to double-digit ROCEs on a
deconsolidated basis, is 6/7% (6.5% actual in FY22), another 300-400 bps gets the
deconsolidated company to ~10% and higher interest rates adds another 100-200 bps to its
sustainable long term ROCE outlook. The last piece is not unique to AIG, if the rest of the P&C
industry can also add 1-2 pts to ROCE from higher interest rates, that shift would be in parallel
to others. Then AIG as a pure P&C insurer would still have a ROCE that lags its peers.
The 300-400 bps of ROCE improvement path is comprised of:
· Underwriting results - which will have to come from the PCG side, in our view, from
remediation and capital market arrangements. Particularly if PCG eventually becomes a full
fee income structure where AIG is just fronting the business that is 100% ceded to third
party capital providers.
· Expense savings: Every $500mn of expense savings equates to 1 pt of ROCE improvement.
AIG expects AIG 200 will yield another $300mn of expense savings in '23. Upon fully
deconsolidation, $300mn of stranded costs within Corporate now will move over to CRBG.
16 February 2023
6
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
Finally, a separate debt capital structure at CRBG that reduced AIG Remain Co. debt by
$9.8bn should also reduce Hold Co interest expense by $500mn when fully separated. That
gets us to ~2.2 pts of ROCE improvement.
· Share repurchases - AIG is committed in utilizing CRBG proceeds to buybacks. It is
important to keep in mind that AIG has to do that, otherwise the company would see EPS
dilution as NCI grows. L&R is the higher ROCE business. AIG reiterated its objective of
reducing its share count to the 600-650mn range.
4Q Highlights
Favorable PYD Spotlight: On a net basis, AIG's net favorable PYD was ~$(150)mn for 4Q22, well
above our expectations and its typical quarterly run rate. On a full year basis, AIG ended the
year with $(430)mn of favorable PYD, just <4x larger than $(118)mn in FY21. For 4Q22, AIG
disclosed favorable PYD from NA casualty and workers compensation partially offset by
unfavorable PYD in financial lines E&O coverages. The majority (85%) of AIG's favorable PYD
came from greener accident years 2021 and 2020.
On a gross basis, BRK was a recipient of unfavorable reserve development under its ADC terms,
in the amount of $121mn (based on 80% cede). AIG retains the remaining 20% unfavorable PYD
subject to the ADC, or $31mn. AIG released $(141)mn of non-ADC reserves in the quarter plus it
recognized a $(41)mn amortization to arrive at its net favorable PYD of $(151)mn in 4Q22.
Therefore, the ADC consumed some adverse PYD that contributed to a higher than typical net
reserve releases in the quarter.
Underlying combined ratio of 88.4% (140 bps improvement y/y) vs. our estimated 89.3%.
International Commercial AYCR improved by 5.1 pts y/y but deteriorated by 1.2 pts sequentially.
NA Commercial AYLR improved 330 pts y/y, however on a sequential basis it deteriorated by 50
bps to 63.0% from 62.5% in 3Q22. We estimated a NA Commercial AYLR of 62.8%. GI NPW
declined (5.9)% y/y, with a drag mostly seen in international personal lines. On a FX constant
basis GI NPW grew 1.4%.
NA Personal Lines AYCR has been unprofitable in three out of four quarters (105.3% in 4Q22,
112.8% in 3Q22 and 94.9% in 4Q21) reflecting ongoing remediation in PCG - from admitted to
non-admitted. We would like to better understand the economics and efficiency of its upcoming
MGA formation with Stone Point where PCG will be supported by third-party capital providers,
following the heals of its reinsurance program with Syndicate 2019.
L&R: Within IR, base portfolio improved 9% sequentially outpacing fee decline. AIG continues to
grow spread business with FA sales up 78% y/y and up 8% q/q. FIA sales up 34% y/y and flattish
q/q. PRT sales were strong at $1.3bn yet down from $2.1bn in 4Q21. AIG's stake in CRBG is
currently 77.7%. AIG consolidates CRBG results (NCI reflects its the equity interest not owned by
AIG) until its ownership stake is <50%.
Key Results
EPS Beat: AIG's 4Q22 operating EPS of $1.36 was above our $1.18 estimate and $1.26 Street
consensus estimate. The beat primarily reflects better-than-expected favorable PYD and GI
underlying combined ratio vs our estimates.
BVPS (common) rose to $53.83 in 4Q22, from $51.58 in 3Q22, as interest rates were higher a
quarter ago.
VII: Alternative returns and reductions in call and tender income were $56mn (pre-tax) worse
than AIG's expectations.
16 February 2023
7
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
Cat losses: $239mn (net of reinsurance) vs. our $260mn estimate.
Capital Management: Parent liquidity of $3.7bn at the end of the quarter, down from $6.5bn at
the end of 3Q22 partly reflecting $1.8bn of debt redemptions in 4Q. $779mn of buybacks were
completed during the quarter (vs. our $880mn estimate).
Forward Looking Statements
· Capital Deployment: AIG will discuss on the 1Q23 earnings call plans to potentially raise its
common dividend that it has not done in years. AIG reiterated its objective of reducing its
share count to 600-650mn range, while achieving leverage at the 20% to 25% level post-
deconsolidation.
· Fixed income/loan portfolio yields: Expected to rise 10-15 bps in 1Q. Over time, yield uplift
from NII could add 1 to 2 pts to ROCE.
· CRBG is expecting spread expansion from compression beginning in 2023, reiterated from
3Q22 earnings.
· GOE - Other Operations: Adds $75-100mn of additional costs related to the separation in
2023, that is on top of $51mn of additional costs recognized in 2022.
· Starting in 2023, Gl International results will be reported on a calendar quarter basis
creating a one-month difference than 2022 on quarterly NPW comparisons but with minimal
impact for the full year.
· LDTI: Adoption in 1Q23 would increase shareholders equity (transition date Jan 1, 2021) by
$800mn-$1.3bn, and adjusted shareholders equity would increase by $1.2-$1.7bn.
Valuation
Our Equal Weight rating and $66 price target (unchanged) are based on a 50/50 weighted
average of 10x (unchanged) our 2024 EPS estimate and 0.7x (unchanged) our 2024 book value
per share (ex-AOCI) estimate. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group
given we expect lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $66 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 10x our 2024 EPS estimate and 0.7x
our 2024 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given we expect lower ROEs,
especially for GI standalone.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a separation.
Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to walk away from
business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings or capital but
undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post separation may temper
AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.
