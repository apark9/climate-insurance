TRV: Higher Loss Trend Spooks the Market; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 4/19 to discuss Q1 results. The call focused
on pricing and underlying trends. Our 2022 EPS goes down to $12.85 (from $13.35),
while our 2023 goes up to $14.50 (from $13.65) and 2024 EPS goes up to $16.20 (from
$15.10). Our 2022 estimate goes down as adjustments to our underlying margins (to
reflect higher loss trend within BI) more than offsets higher investment income from the
recent rise in yields and TRV's higher quarterly net investment income guide. For 2023
and 2024, our estimates go higher as greater investment income (from higher yields)
more than offsets weaker underlying margins. Our price target is unchanged at $180. TRV
traded down (-4.9% versus the S&P which was +1.6%), reflecting underlying loss ratios
falling short of expectations and the company adding to its loss trend assumption in the
quarter.
. The biggest take is the higher loss trend assumption. TRV spoke about elevated
severity with the inflationary environment and added to their loss trend assumption in
the quarter. Even with the higher loss trend, they do think that written rate continues
to exceed this elevated loss trend. While the core rate within Business Insurance
(known as the RRC) dropped to 4.4% in the quarter (putting it below loss trend, which
is now most likely close to 6%), Travelers said that a portion of its exposure counts as
price (they have not wanted to say exactly how much exposure is counting as price),
which helps put pricing above loss trend. The company saw around 100 basis points of
earned rate over trend in BI in the quarter, and we are modeling for that to decelerate
as we move through the year.
. Is this the end of the hard part of the commercial cycle? While commercial lines price
slowed in the quarter as more lines are adequate, the higher loss picks seen at TRV
could lead to higher written pricing from here (and prolong the time period that the
market stays above loss trend). Further, while courts are slowly reopening, Travelers is
still concerned about social inflation spiking as courts get back to pre-pandemic levels.
· What about personal auto? The personal auto results missed us, but were more than
overshadowed by the higher loss trend in BI. Within auto, TRV flagged frequency
returning to more normal levels and higher severity. They did say that they are aiming
to get their price in personal auto close to the double digits on an overall basis by the
end of the year. With the RPC at 3.1% in the quarter, they have ways to go to reach
this target. We remain cautious on the personal auto sector - for more see our recent
personal lines deep dive.
· Our updated thoughts on the group. While the slowdown in underlying margin
improvement, and higher loss trend assumption, is broadly negative for the group we
do think there are some positives to take from it. First of all this can add legs to the
harder market (MarketScout for instance saw strong rate increases in March relative
to the other months in the Q1 - see Exhibit 2 inside) and all peers may not be affected
to the same degree. TRV had been less conservative than peers in letting all the price
increases fall to the bottom line. Some of the more conservative underwriters (which
would include AIG, CB, and WRB) could still see a good level of margin improvement
even if they also increase their loss picks. We continue to remain bullish on the
commercial lines sector and think companies being disciplined with loss trend can help
to prolong the upturn.

Weaker Underlying Loss Ratio Overshadows Beat Versus The Street
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 4/19 to discuss Q1 results. The call focused on pricing,
and underlying trends. Our 2022 EPS is $12.85 (from $13.35), while our 2023 goes to $14.50 (from
$13.65) and 2024 EPS goes to $16.20 (from $15.10). Our 2022 estimate goes down as adjustments
to our underlying margins (to reflect higher loss trend within BI) that more than offsets higher
investment income from the recent rise in yields and TRV's higher quarterly net investment income
guide. For 2023/2024 our estimates go higher as greater investment income (from higher yields)
more than offsets weaker underlying margins.
The quarter in a nutshell. This morning (4/19), TRV reported Q1 core EPS of $4.22, missing our
$4.54 estimate, but beating consensus of $3.61 consensus. TRV missed us on weaker results from
alternative investments (we had expected a beat given the S&P performance in Q4). Away from
other investments, TRV saw a better combined ratio due to lower cats and better prior year reserve
development, while the underlying loss ratio fell short of us with weaker loss ratios in all segments. The
tax rate was also lower than us, coming in at 13.9%, lower than our 18.4% estimate as TRV benefited
from the release of $47 million of tax accruals (when adjusting for this the tax rate would have been
17.8%). The underlying combined ratio of 91.2%, missed our 90.3% estimate, with Business Insurance
beating us (on its expense ratio), while Bond & Specialty and Personal Lines (weak results in both auto
and home) missed us. Net premiums rose by 11.4%, beating our 4.9% estimate with all segments
seeing growth come in above our expectations. Net investment income was $637 million, missing
our $853 million due to other investments. Catastrophe losses were only $79 million, lower than our
$225 million. Favorable reserve development was $153 million, better than our $75 million estimate
due to a better level in Business Insurance and Bond and Specialty. Business Insurance saw favorable
development of $113 million (better than our $37 million) with favorable development in workers'
compensation being slightly offset by a $45 million environmental reserve charge. Repurchases were
$559 million (includes $59MM outside of board of director authorized repurchases), ahead of our
$400 million. Book value per share declined by 11% (due to the mark to market on the investment
portfolio), and the core ROE was 15.5%.
Exhibit 1 below shows TRV's actual results versus our expectations and you can go here to see our first
look note on the quarter: TRV: Q1 Misses Us on Alts; Weaker Underlying Loss Ratio Should Weigh on
Shares.

Takeaways for the Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us, and the laterals for the rest of the group are below.
Net-net, the biggest takes are that TRV is seeing elevated loss trend within Business Insurance, and is
also seeing high frequency and severity trends within Personal Insurance. Highlights of the laterals that
we see for the group follow below:
· Commercial lines pricing remains strong, but is decelerating, with renewal rates up 4.4% in Q1 in
Business Insurance, slowing from 5.1% in Q4 2021, 6.2% in Q3, and 7.0% in Q2. Further the
higher loss trend could potential add legs to the hard market, which could potentially be shown
by MarketScout seeing its strongest rates of the quarter in March (see Exhibit 2 below). Rates
staying above loss trend is a positive for the commercial insurers (AIG, CB, HIG, and WRB) and
specifically, AIG and CB, where workers' comp represent a smaller portion of their book, in our
view.

· Underlying margin in Business Insurance benefited from rate exceeding trend. TRV said that earned
rate exceeded loss trend by around 1.0 point, which is a slowdown from 1.5 points in Q4 2021 and
an even greater slowdown when compared to around 2% over the other three quarters of 2021.
While the slowdown in underlying margin improvement, and higher loss trend assumption,
is a negative for the group, TRV had been less conservative than peers in letting all the price
increases fall to the bottom line. Some of the more conservative underwriters (which would
include AIG, CB, and WRB) could still see a good level of margin improvement even if they also
increase their loss picks.
· Strong exposure growth. Exposure growth was a record 4.7%, which was higher than 4.3% in Q4,
and is a bullish sign for the insurance brokers. This adds to the good lateral we already have from
the good organic growth quarter from Truist. This appears to be a good sign for all insurance
brokers-given that TRV is more of a small-middle market insurer, it is the best take for AJG
and BRO, but does point to a good quarter for the group in general.
. No Covid-19 or Russia/Ukraine losses were called out. For Covid-19, this was the case over the past
year as well, and ties to our overall thought that Covid-19 related losses have largely subsided for
the P&C sector. TRV also said it has minimal exposure to Russia/Ukraine, given the majority of its
business stems from the U.S. We do not expect to see many, if any, Covid-19 losses from P&C
insurers in Q1, but could see some Russia/Ukraine losses for some (re)insurers with greater
international exposure.
· Personal auto frequency and severity trends pressure results. TRV's Personal Auto book was affected
by frequency trends that remain at pre-pandemic levels and also saw elevated severity. The
Personal Auto segment's underlying margin came in at 98.8%, which was better than the Q4
although the Q1 is seasonally a better quarter, and still puts the company above its pre-pandemic
margins. The weaker auto results at TRV (as well as PGR) point to a tough quarter for the
group. We remain cautious on the personal auto insurers (ALL [Underweight, $141.74] and
PGR [Underweight, $111.15]), reflective of neither getting enough price and the elevated/
frequency and severity trends. TRV is looking to take to continue to take rate in personal auto,
and does expect its RPC to rise and close to the double digits by the end of this year.

. Net investment income guide was raised. The company raised its guidance for fixed income
investment income of $440 million after-tax in Q2, $460 million in Q3 and $480 million in Q4., up
from the prior $430-440 million for every quarter of 2022. This is a good lateral for most (if not
all) insurers, in our view.
· Slightly above normal alternative investment quarter. Alternative-related investment income totaled
$142 million in Q1, down from $243 million in Q4, and below our $358 million estimate. We had
thought the stronger S&P performance (up over 10% in Q4) would lead to outsized alternative
results given the one quarter lag on private equity returns. Given TRV missed us, we could
potentially see other insurers miss our alternative investment assumption, but still think it will
be a better-than-normal quarter.
2022 Updated Soundbites
Highlights of its updated outlook for 2022. Exhibit 3 below highlights TRV's commentary and
expectations for 2022. TRV did not provide much specific 2022 guidance other than fixed income NII,
expense ratio, and general pricing expectations.
. TRV raised its quarterly fixed income NII to be $440 million after-tax in Q2, $460 million in Q3,
and $480 million in Q4. This is up from its prior guidance for quarterly fixed income investment
income to be in the range of $430-$440 million range on an after-tax basis for all of 2022.
. In Business Insurance, TRV saw 1.9 points of improvement Y/Y on the underlying combined
ratio with around 1.0 point coming from earned pricing that continues to exceed loss costs and
1.1 points from a lower expense ratio. TRV said that it adjusted its loss picks to reflect elevated
severity trends in the quarter. Within BI, rate exceeded loss trend by around 1.0 point, which is
down from 1.5 points in the Q4 and around 2.0 points in Q3 and Q2, a little less than 2.0 points in
Q1, and over 1.5 points in Q4 2020. We are modeling for that 1.0 point of earned rate over loss
trend to continue to decline from here as we move through 2022.
. In Bond and Specialty, TRV did not lay out specific guidance for the year.
. In Personal lines, TRV mentioned that frequency is returning to more normal levels and that they
are seeing elevated severity. TRV saw an average 7% rate in the quarter (in 23 states) with an
overall premium change of 3.1% (implying TRV is getting price in 44% of its personal auto book)
and that they expect to approach double-digit rate by the end of the year.
. With the aggregate reinsurance cover, TRV has accumulated $175 million toward the retention
as of the end of the Q1. With the aggregate cover, TRV gets $225 million of protection as part of
$500 million of coverage above a $2 billion retention.
. TRV reaffirmed its expense ratio target of mid-29s in the near term, essentially flat to 29.4%
2021, and continues to expect its expense ratio to move down to 29% over the next couple of
years. We are now looking for expense ratios of 29.2% in 2022, 28.9% in 2023, and 28.8% in 2024.

TRV expects their expense ratio to remain in the mid-29%
range in the near term and then gradually move down to
around 29% over the next couple of years.
TRV expects their expense ratio to be around 29,5% for
FY22 and then gradually move down to around 29% in the
next year or two.
Given social and other inflation, frequency and persisting low
rate environment, they will continue to see pricing gains to
improve profitability.
The change in their cyber underwriting (minimum

favorable impact on cyber claim frequency (cyber remains a
small portion of the book), is expected to be completed at

numbers).
Homeowners will continue to experience elevated weather
and non-weather loss activity and they will seek rate in
response while also taking into account labor and materials
inflation.
Expect to see increase pricing as higher severity persists.
They expect Q2 to be the seasonally higher quarter for
weather-related loss levels.
TRV did not provide specific guidance for premium volumes
for 2022, as expected. They did note they expect retention
levels to remain strong by historical standards into 2022.
TRV expects higher renewal premium changes going into
2022,
TRV expects renewal premium changes to accelerate in each
of the next 3 quarters and approach double digits by the end
of the year.
Expects the after-tax investment income from the fixed
income portfolio will be approximately $420 to $430 million
for each quarter of 2022.
Expects the after-tax investment income from the fixed
income portfolio will be approximately $430 to $440 million
(up $10M versus last quarter guidance) for each quarter of
2022.
Expects the after-tax investment income from the fixed
income portfolio to be up $440MM for Q2, $460MM for Q3,
and $480MM for Q4 (up from the $430-$440MM per quarter
guidance previously)
Expect their results from PE, hedge funds and real estate
partnerships that are reported on a quarter lag, which were
generally down during the first quarter, to show in Q2
results.
Company expects that over time the combination of
dividends and share repurchases will likely not exceed net
income.

Overview of our estimate changes. Exhibit 4 highlights the changes we made to our earnings model
following Q1 2022 earnings. Our 2022 EPS is $12.85 (from $13.35), while our 2023 goes to $14.50
(from $13.65) and 2024 EPS goes to $16.20 (from $15.10). Our 2022 estimate goes down as
adjustments to our underlying margins (to reflect higher loss trend within BI) that more than offsets
higher investment income from the recent rise in yields and TRV's higher quarterly net investment
income guide. For 2023 and 2024, our estimates go higher as greater investment income (from higher
yields) more than offsets weaker underlying margins.

Pricing Slowing in Commercial Lines
Business Insurance Rating Environment-TRV Rates Taper Down, but Remain Above Higher Loss
Trend
· In Q1, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +4.4%, decelerating from +5.1% last quarter,
and below +6.2% in Q3 2021, +7.0% in Q2 2021, and +7.9% in Q1 2021. Exposure growth was
+4.7%, versus +4.3 last quarter, +4.0% in Q3 2021, +3.1% in Q2 2021, and +1.7% in Q1. Exhibits 5
and 6, below, show the recent trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal
rate change. Travelers continued to point to written rate exceeding loss trend (even with its higher
loss trend assumption this quarter) and said that some part of the RPC acts as rate (although they
did not want to provide the exact portion of exposure that acts as price as it varies by quarter).
· TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC (in the summer of 2020), as the company was
unsure of how the economy would be affected by Covid-19. The company has yet to bring back
RPC forward guidance, but has pointed to margin improvement, as Business Insurance earned rate
remains in excess of loss trend. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains positive
in Q2 2022 with some flattening as we navigate through 2022, especially as we come up against
some tougher comps when the economy started to improve post the pandemic lows.

Personal Lines-TRV Continues To Take Price in Auto and Home As Severity Remains Elevated
· Within Personal Insurance, TRV saw an acceleration in rate in personal auto in the quarter, as it
pushes for price. The RPC in auto was +3.1%, picking up from +1.2% in Q4, +0.5% in Q2, and +0.6%
in Q1. On the auto side, TRV said that auto driving frequency is returning to more normal levels
and that it took rate in 23 states in the Q1 for an average rate changes of 7% (which was close to
the guidance they provided on the last call that they are anticipating rate in 25 different states)
with more actions planned in the subsequent quarters. They did emphasize it will take time for
these rate actions to earn into their results. The RPC, even with acceleration, is still modest at 3.1%
as severity remains in the double digits and TRV is getting price in only 44% of its personal auto
book. They did mention they expect rate to continue accelerating each quarter and reach double-
digits by the end of the year. This ties into our theme that we need to see more rate going through
more of the personal auto premium base, not just for Travelers, but across the auto insurance
industry. See our recent personal lines deep dive.
. Homeowners' pricing was relatively flat sequentially and up Y/Y at 12.3% in the Q1, compared to
8.6% last quarter, 8.8% in Q3 8.1% in Q2, and 7.5% in Q1. On the home side, TRV said it will look to
take more rate as a result of the higher severity in labor and material prices. They did point to the
second quarter being seasonally a higher weather-related loss quarter for homeowners' business.
· Travelers' new business in auto increased 4% sequentially, and was up 4% when compared to last
year, with auto new business premiums totaling $290 million, versus $279 million in Q4, $297
million in Q3, $299 million in Q2, and $278 million in Q1. Home new business was down 5%
sequentially and down slightly Y/Y at 2% in the quarter at $258 million, versus $273M last quarter,
$312 million in Q3, $335 million in Q2, and $263 million last Q1. Further, TRV did show PIF growth
in auto (see Exhibit 7 below) which is counter to PGR who has been pulling back as they haven't
been able to get enough price.

Profitability Impacted By Weaker Underlying Results
Underlying Results Came in Worse than Expected
· The consolidated combined ratio was 91.2%, worse than our 90.3% estimate, largely reflective of
weaker underlying results partially offset by higher level of favorable reserve development and
lower cats. Cats were only $160 million, better than our $225 million estimate, while favorable
reserve development of $163 million was better than our estimate for favorable development $75
million, due to better-than-expected PYD in Business Insurance (from workers' compensation)
and Bonds & Specialty. The underlying combined ratio of 91.2% was unfavorable to our estimate
of 90.3%, and 1.7 points worse than last year. The Underlying combined ratio missed us in Bond
& Specialty and Personal Insurance due to higher underlying losses, while beating us by 70 bps on
the BI side (due to a lower expense ratio mainly stemming from higher earned premiums, while
BI missed us on the loss side). On the BI side, we were almost a full point above consensus (92.5%
versus 91.5% consensus per Visible Alpha) so the underlying combined ratio of 91.7% actually
missed from a consensus standpoint. Within personal lines, the underlying combined ratio rose
by 7.4 points due to higher losses in both auto (main driver) and homeowners'. Auto was up 12.2
points versus the prior year quarter due to a combination of frequency returning to more normal
levels and higher loss severity as vehicle and replacement and repair costs remain elevated.
· Catastrophe losses totaled $160 million, below our $225 million estimate.TRV did note that
catastrophe losses primarily resulted from wind storms in multiple states. Through March 31,
they have accumulated $175 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention (under
its aggregate reinsurance cover TRV gets $225 million of protection as part of $500 million of
coverage above a $2 billion retention).
. Prior year favorable reserve development came in at $153 million, better than our estimate of
$75 million, due to a higher level of reserve releases in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty.
Business Insurance saw favorable development of $113 million, better than our estimate for
a release of $37 million, which was driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic
operations in workers' comp for multiple accident years (which more than offset a modest level
of environmental reserve strengthening). Bond & Specialty saw a release of $35 million (better
than our estimate for favorable development of $16 million), due to better-than-expected loss
experience in fidelity and surety for recent accident years, partially offset by higher than expected
loss experience in general liability for multiple accident years. Personal Lines saw favorable
development of $5 million (worse than our estimate for reserve releases of $22 million) with small
movements in both auto and home.

Investment Income, Capital Return And Other
Investment Income Beats Us; Raises 2022 Guidance On Higher Interest Rates
. Net investment income was $637 million pre-tax, worse than our $853 million estimate as we
assumed a higher alts return (as the S&P was up nearly 10% in the Q4 and alts are reported on a
one-quarter lag) while our fixed portfolio was virtually in line. Travelers' after-tax book yield on its
investment portfolio was 2.5%, below the 2.9% yield in Q4 2021. Fixed income investments added
$505 million pre-tax, right in line with our estimate, while alts were $142 million, lower than our
$358 million estimate. Short-term investments added $2 million, below our $3 million estimate.
. As a result of the higher trending interest rates, TRV now expects their net investment income
from their fixed portfolio to be $440M million for Q2, $460 million for Q3 and $480 million for Q4,
which is a revision up from the $430-440 million range per quarter for 2022 that they provided in
the Q4 2021 conference call earlier this year. They also mentioned their average portfolio turnover
is about 9% annualized.
Capital Management Ahead Of Expectations On Better Buyback Level; Raise Dividend
· TRV repurchased 2.9 million shares in Q1 for $500 million (at an average price of $172), better
than our estimate for $400 million of share repurchases, but lower than the $800 million in Q4
2021. They bought back an additional 0.4 million shares for $59MM outside the board of director
authorization (which we did not model). Dividends were $214 million, bringing total capital return
to $714 million (ex repurchases outside of authorization), compared to the $1,037 million of core
earnings. They also announced a 6% dividend increase to $0.93 (from $0.88), marking the 18th
consecutive year of dividend increases. Total capital return to shareholders was 68.9% of core
earnings in Q1 2022, versus 78.8% in Q4 2021 and 86.1% for all of 2021, and we are currently
forecasting 86.4% and 76.0% in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Premium Growth Benefited from Record Exposure Growth And Retention Levels
. Net premiums written rose 11.5%, well above our 4.9% estimate, and accelerating from the +10.1%
in Q4 2021.Results were ahead of us in all three segments (BI, Bonds & Specialty, and Personal).
Gross premiums written growth of 10.4% was ahead of our 6.8% estimate, and accelerated from
9.8% last quarter.
· Business insurance net premiums written were up 9.1%, beating our +5.1% estimate, and just
below +9.4% in the Q4. Bond & Specialty net premiums written were +22.0%, also beating our
+3.8% estimate, and accelerating from +13.1% last quarter. Personal Insurance net premiums
written were +12.3%, beating our +4.7% estimate and above the +10.1% last quarter. Within
Personal Insurance, auto net premiums written of +8.5% was above our +4.6% estimate and
accelerating from the +7.5% last quarter, while home net premiums written growth of +16.9% was
well above our +4.9% estimate, and also up when compared to +12.8% last quarter.

Equity Research
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Allstate Corporation (ALL)
Investment Thesis
We believe ALL's margins have peaked and the company should be impacted by elevated severity trends and a spike in frequency as driving
picks up, both of which should pressure its margins. As margins are constrained by the higher loss trends, we believe valuation could
contract and thus have an Underweight rating on the shares.
Target Price Valuation for ALL: $123.00
Our price target of $123 represents around a 1.30x multiple on our 2023 book value per share estimate of approximately $94.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for ALL
Risks to the upside include margins coming in above expectations if severity and frequency trends are better-than-expected, elevated
severity trends abating much quicker than expected, frequency benefiting from rising gas prices, and policy and premium growth coming in
above expectations.
The Progressive Corporation (PGR)
Investment Thesis
We have an Underweight rating on the shares. As Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out and driving picks up, frequency should revert back to
more normalized levels, which combined with elevated severity trends, should pressure margins for PGR, in our view. Further, PGR's policy
growth should continue to slow as they advertise less and look to lower their top-line growth in response to the higher loss trend. The
combination of weaker margins and slowing top-line growth should cause the PGR shares to underperform the insurance sector.
Target Price Valuation for PGR: $96.00
Our $96 price target is based on (1) about a 2.50x multiple of our 2023 GAAP book value estimate of around $38.35 per share and (2) just
above 16x our 2023 EPS estimate.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for PGR
Risks to the upside include continued favorable frequency trends, especially with rising gas prices, an improvement in severity trends, and
stronger-than-anticipated premium and policy growth.
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will benefit from one of the hardest commercial pricing environment since 2003. Although we are positive on the
commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers due to its smaller account exposure and higher workers'
comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation, lower
reserve releases, and Covid-19, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral
and rate its shares Equal Weight as a result.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $180.00 from NC
Our price target of $180 is based on around a ~1.53x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $117 and 12.4x our
2023 EPS estimate of $14.50.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
