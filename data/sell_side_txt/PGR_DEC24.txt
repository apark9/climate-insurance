Dec results: Strong underlying and
far better than expected
catastrophes lead to EPS beat
Underlying loss and combined ratios come in below
expectations, while cat losses are significantly lower then
anticipated. PIF growth strong again, but slightly below our
expectations.
December net EPS of $1.60 is well above our estimate of $1.27. The beat comes primarily due to
1) strong performance company wide, specifically in Property, Commercial, and Agency, 2)
much lower than expected catastrophe losses for the month, and 3) solid favorable prior-year-
development. Cat losses came in at $(67) million which was significantly below our $66 million
estimate, as favorable development associated with Hurricanes Helene and Milton exceeded
current month storm losses. Progressive also saw favorable prior year development to the tune
of $56 million, or 80 bps. Company wide underlying loss ratio came in below our expectations at
66.2% vs. our 66.4%. Underlying Combined ratio also came in 180 bps below our estimate,
printing 85.9% vs. our 87.7%. PIF growth continues to be very strong, although comes in a touch
below our estimates across the board. NPW growth missed our mark of 28.5% by 6.2 points,
coming in at 22.3%. NPE growth of 26.5% came in well above our estimate of 18%. Overall, a
solid print as PIF growth remained strong, catastrophes came in much better than expected,
and very strong company wide results (specifically in Property, Commercial, and Agency)
contributed to a bottom line beat.
Policies In Force: PIF growth was very strong yet again for the month of December, although
slightly below our expectations across the board. Company wide PIF growth came in at 17.7%
vs. our expectation of 18.0%. Agency saw growth of 17.3% y/y which compares to our 17.6%
estimate. Direct grew 25.1% y/y vs. our 25.5% estimate. Personal Lines showed growth of 18.8%,
slightly below our 19.1%. Commercial growth came in at 3.9% y/y vs. our 4.5% estimate. Lastly,
Property PIF grew 13.6%, slightly below our 14% estimate. Sequentially, Agency PIF grew 78k
and Direct PIF grew 132k.
Personal Lines: Underlying loss ratio came in at 67.7%, slightly above our 66.8% estimate.
Expense ratio came in at 19.5% which compares to our 21.1% estimate. NPW growth was 27.5%
vs. our 32.7%. NPE growth was 30.7%, well above our 23.6% estimate. Personal Lines posted
underwriting income of $767.9 million compared to our $590.3 million. On a segment basis
within Personal, Agency underlying combined ratio of 84.1% was better than our 85.7%
estimate and Direct's underlying combined of 89.6% was in-line with our 89.6% estimate.

Commercial Lines: Underlying loss ratio in Commercial Lines was 65.6%, significantly below
our 70.6% estimate. NPW growth of 0.5% came in weaker than our 7.5% estimate, although we
would note commercial lines NPW was lower due to a decrease in the monthly adjustment for
projected mileage in the TNC business which excluding this would have been 5%. NPE growth
however was 10.2%, above of -7.7% estimate. Underwriting income of $151.4 million came in
well above our $76.3 million estimate.
Property: Underlying loss ratio came in much better than expected at 31.5% vs. our 48%.
Expense ratio also came in at 30%, 100 bps above our estimate of 29%. Combined ratio was
61.5% vs. our 77% estimate, a strong beat. NPW growth was -7.8% y/y for December vs. our 14%
growth estimate, and NPE growth of 10.4% came in lower than our 11.9% estimate.
Underwriting income of $151.6 million was far above our $40.2 million estimate.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services,
if applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.

Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $261 reflects a 5.0x P/BVPS xAOCI multiple on our 2Q25E BVPS xAOCI estimate of $55.55 which we derive
from a P/BV vs ROE regression and assuming PGR trades at a 47% premium to the regression line.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside Risks: The greatest upside risk is that PGR
executes on its growth strategy better than we anticipate driving top line led beat and raises. Downside Risks: We see downside risk if PGR is not able
to meet high expectations for growth or if that growth leads to more margin pressure than expected.

Russia: This material is not intended for investors who are not Qualified Investors according to the laws of the Russian Federation as it might contain
information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
