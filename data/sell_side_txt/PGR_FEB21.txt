Steep underlying margins compression sequentially. PGR's reported an 88.9% underlying
combined ratio vs. 81.5% in January. PGR's underlying results are approaching pre-pandemic
levels as Feb '20 had an underlying combined ratio of 90.1%. As the economy reopens and
lockdown measures continue to be rolled back we see personal auto loss trend reverting to
the mean and frequency tailwinds continuing to cool (see Figure 4 and Figure 5).
February's cat losses were $86 contributing 2.7 points to the combined ratio, below our
catastrophe loss estimate for February ($100mn) that had included a normalized cat load in
addition to Winter Storm Uri piercing PGR's $80mn retention threshold on its reinsurance
occurrence XOL program.
PIF growth - Personal Auto: Personal auto PIF growth y/y missed our February estimates
with Agent of 8.5% (vs. 8.5% Barclays estimate) and Direct of 12.8% (vs. 13% Barclays
estimate). PGR continued making efforts to file rate decreases (Figure 6) during the back
half of 2020 and into 2021, notably relative to the rest of the industry. We think the market
is too focused on auto PIF growth. Our concerns remain more foundational in nature as
excessive growth in risker auto classes like commercial (y/y growth NPW in Feb was 32%)
could dilute PGR's ROE profile.
Estimates and valuation update. We believe PGR's stock performance reflects greater
skepticism on the trajectory of PIF growth and winding down benefits from frequency
trends. As such we are maintaining our price target of $85 and reiterating our Underweight
rating on PGR. We had taken a more conservative view than the Street regarding PGR's loss
trend reverting back to more normalized frequency loss trends considering a reopening of
the economy. We are maintaining that stance but dialing down the degree of reversion a bit
from our original assumptions. As such, we are updating our '21 EPS estimates from $5.34
to $5.68. Our valuation represents a weighted average of 15.0x 2021 EPS and 2.9x 2021 BV
ex AOCI of $29.40. Previously, our price target reflected a weighted average of 15.5x 2021
EPS and 2.9x 2021 BV ex AOCI of $29.29.

Stock Rating: UNDERWEIGHT
Price (17-Mar-2021)
USD 91.10
Price Target
N/A
USD 85.00
Why Underweight? Our call on PGR takes a longer
term view. PGR may need to hold more capital to
support an evolving business mix, which could lower
ROEs. We see PGR's business expansion beyond core
personal auto focus to be more defensive vs.
offensive. PGR's excess growth in commercial auto
runs against the industry grain and expands risk
appetite to riskier auto classes.
Upside case
USD 92.00
If PGR is able to leverage its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines, it could achieve
the same measurable success as its core personal
auto book. Our upside case of $92 assumes a 16x P/E
multiple on our '21 EPS estimate.
Downside case
USD 75.00
We think margins peak in 2020 and are not reflective
of longer term trends. Auto pricing reflects artificially
low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic. Our
downside case of $75 assumes a 13x P/E multiple on
our '21 EPS estimate.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

Allstate Corp. (ALL)
Progressive Corp. (PGR)

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage
services, if applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank

Valuation Methodology: Our $85 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted 15.0x P/E multiple on our '21 EPS estimate of $5.68 and 2.9x P/BV
excluding AOCI on our '21 BVPS ex. AOCI of $29.40.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR were
to meet its 96% combined ratio objective in newer business lines driving the recent expansion of its core business profile by leveraging its
multivariate pricing model. In addition, we think margins are peaking in 2020 due to environmental factors and not reflective of longer-term
trends but if PGR is able to avoid margin pressure over the long term it could maintain a stronger earnings growth profile than anticipated. While
auto pricing currently reflects artificially low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic, a reversion to more normal pricing points should prove
difficult to achieve. However, normalization of pricing could drive better performance in personal auto.
