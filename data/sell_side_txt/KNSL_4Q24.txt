Post 4Q24 Follow Up: Reducing EPS and Price Target;
Neutral
We are reducing our EPS estimates and price target for KNSL, from $412 to
$402. Our Neutral rating is unchanged. Kinsale reported 4Q24 earnings on
2/13/2025 and hosted a conference call the following day, on 2/14/2025.
· Trimming EPS estimates. We are lowering EPS (1Q25: $4.03 to $3.14, 2025:
$18.47 to $17.38, 2026: from $21.71 to $21.16). Our updated model
incorporates (1) $25 million of LA wildfire losses in 1Q25, as disclosed by
management (prior total catastrophe loss assumption for 1Q25 was $2 million),
(2) slightly lower net investment income, partly because of KNSL's plan to
increase its allocation to equities (dividend yields are < fixed income yields),
and (3) the flow through of lower premium growth in 4Q24 into future periods.
Other than the LA wildfire, our underwriting margin assumptions for 2025 and
subsequent periods are largely unchanged. Also, we are maintaining our
assumptions for gross premium growth (1Q25: +15%, 2025: +15%, 2026:
+12%). Consistent with past practice, we will arrive at a more refined view of
1Q25 gross written premiums towards the end of March using reporting from
state stamping offices and 4Q24 statutory premium data, which gives a
breakdown between casualty and property business.
· As KNSL's growth transitions from exceptional to very good, we think
that valuation approaches which incorporate equity, as opposed to being
solely based on earnings, will become more relevant. KNSL's operating
ROE has been running close to 30% in recent years (2022: +27%, 2023: +33%,
2024: +29%), driving a commensurate increase in equity. Over the same time
period, NPW growth has slowed, mainly due to normalization in the property
business (2022: +42%, 2023: +35%, 2024: +17%). If KNSL's prospective
growth travels more closely to recent levels as we expect (recognizing new
opportunities management is pursuing, a potential uplift in casualty pricing,
and KNSL's push to more actively trade off pricing and volumes - all of which
could add incremental growth), capital generation from the back book is likely
to far outpace the surplus needed to write business. Consequently, we would
expect net written premium leverage (a rough approximation of required
capital which does not account for factors such as KNSL's intent to grow its
exposure to equities) to decline by ~10 points per year from 100% at year-end
2024, suggesting excess capital generation of $200-300 million (~$9-13 per
share) annually. This assumes that 100% is the appropriate premium leverage
for KNSL (our view is that KNSL can operate at higher premium leverage) and
that KNSL maintains its current financial leverage of 11% (our view is that
KNSL has the flexibility to bring this to peer levels closer to 20%). Capital
return is at the discretion of management, and for now its preferred approach
is a modest share buyback program ($90 million authorization outstanding).
F.Morgan
· We continue to think that downside risk to EPS from slowing growth has
less tail risk than before. KNSL's recent growth trajectory (GPW growth of
+19% in 3Q24, +12% in 4Q24) is within the range of the long-run growth

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly
traded P&C insurer that operates exclusively in the E&S
insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts.
Our long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large
addressable market, superior technology platform, and low cost
base, which we view as a sustainable competitive advantage.
Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are
concerned about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C
pricing cycle moderates.

trajectory management believes the company can grow, and so our view is that potential
downside in expectations is less than before. Also, investment income (new money yield
is still greater than the portfolio yield), share buybacks, and modest improvement in
underwriting margins (reserve releases, expense leverage) could serve as offsets to
slower premium growth, as has been the case in the past two quarters.
· 4Q24 summary: earnings higher, with better margins more than offsetting lower
premiums. 4Q24 operating EPS was $4.62, above our $4.42 estimate and consensus of
$4.34. Underwriting income was better than our model (+$0.30 per share after taxes),
with lower attritional claims (+$0.27), lower catastrophe losses (+$0.08), higher fee
income (+$0.02), and higher reserve releases (+$0.01) more than offsetting higher
expenses (-$0.05) and a modest shortfall in earned premiums (-$0.03). Net investment
income was slightly below our estimate (-$0.02 per share). Gross written premiums
(GPW) rose +12.2% to $443.3 million, below our +17.0% estimate ($462.4 million) and
consensus of +17.4% ($464.0 million, midpoint of $443-487 million range). KNSL's
combined ratio in 4Q24 was 73.4%, better than our 75.8% estimate and consensus of
76.9%. Compared to our model, the favorable variance was driven by lower attritional
losses (52.7% vs. 54.8%E), higher reserve releases (-2.6% vs. - 2.5%E), and lower
catastrophe claims (2.1% vs. 2.8%E), partly offset by a higher expense ratio (21.1% vs.
20.7%E). The core combined ratio (73.9% vs. 75.5%E) was better as well.
· We are Neutral. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates exclusively
in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our long-term
outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior technology
platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive advantage. Still,
the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned about the risk of
multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates. Having said this, if KNSL's
near-term growth trajectory comes in above our expectations, we could become more
constructive on the stock.

Investment Thesis
KNSL held its earnings conference call on
February 14, 2025. The call replay is
available on https://
ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We are Neutral. Overall, we expect KNSL's premiums and margins to benefit from
favorable trends in the E&S market, which continues to generate healthy growth at
attractive pricing/terms even after several years of above-trend growth. Despite more
competitive conditions, the property market remains compelling in aggregate, especially
in small commercial where pricing continues to increase. In the meantime, casualty
pricing is experiencing another uptick as more insurers recognize adverse development.
Independent of the market environment, we think that Kinsale's low-cost operating
model is a sustainable competitive advantage, especially against higher cost insurers like
Lloyd's writers. During periods of softer pricing, KNSL's lower expense ratio will allow
it to be more competitive on pricing while still generating above-average growth and
margins. Also, the combination of strong capital generation in recent years, slowing
premium growth, and below-average financial leverage implies that KNSL is likely to
have excess capital that will be returned to shareholders via share buybacks or
dividends. We remain Neutral on the stock, however, as we think its valuation is full
compared to commercial peers and specialist names even after giving credit to KNSL's
growth potential and above-average margins. Furthermore, while favorable P&C market
conditions are likely to persist through 2025 and will have positive implications for
KNSL's reserves and future earnings, the eventual turn in the P&C pricing cycle is a
downside risk to the stock's above-average multiple. Less favorable development on
older accident years could also decrease the quantum of future reserve releases. Having
said this, if KNSL's near-term growth trajectory comes in better than our expectations,
we could become more upbeat on the stock.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
In our view, the E&S market - where KNSL operates exclusively - will eventually see
moderating new business volumes and price hikes as more underwriters focus on growth
(a negative for pricing) and admitted markets increase their appetite for risk (recapturing
business from E&S). We also expect retail brokers to eventually divert business back to
admitted markets to recapture the economics they are sharing with wholesalers. Still,
our view is that KNSL can continue to grow premiums at a healthy pace given its small
base, the fragmented pricing cycle (whereby certain lines such as property excluding
high value homeowners' are seeing pricing deceleration while others such as casualty
are seeing another upward inflection), and its ability to be competitive on pricing
because of its meaningful expense ratio advantage. With respect to profitability, our
view is that the combination of price hikes and conservative reserving will support
healthy margins at KNSL for the foreseeable future. However, we think that reserve
releases will diminish in the near term given that more mature accident years (2015-
2019) are likely to have less redundancy than before, and that more recent accident
years (2020 and onwards) - where presumably embedded margins are thicker - are still
un-seasoned. Also, to the extent that the gap between nominal pricing and loss trends
continues to narrow, there is less scope for attritional loss ratios to improve.
Low Cost Base a Sustainable Competitive Advantage
KNSL has a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform built from ground up -
in contrast to peers that use unwieldy systems built off legacy and newer technologies -
which allows it to handle significant business volumes without sacrificing customer
responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense efficiency. As a result, KNSL

maintains an industry leading expense ratio, and we expect it to outperform higher cost
competitors through the pricing cycle. During softer markets, KNSL can grow
premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-average profitability, and in hard
markets, Kinsale can be a price taker and generate excess returns.
KNSL is in the process of updating its technology platform towards a "target state"
(about half-way through as of January 2025 at the company's investor day) with more
modular architecture and where insured data can be accessed across multiple
applications simultaneously. Management expects these upgrades to deliver cost
efficiencies, incremental revenues, and analytical capabilities. The amount of funding
for this initiative was not sized by Kinsale, but management noted that it should be fully
absorbed in the current run-rate expense ratio.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle Is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect price hikes to
eventually moderate as re/insurers re-position themselves for growth. Given this, we see
multiple compression as a risk since pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in
E&S because of its function as a safety valve for the market. Although we think some
portion of E&S share gains is permanent and that KNSL will thrive even if prices
soften, a reasonable valuation analysis will have to look several years out because of
KNSL's above-average growth profile and would thus have to account for conditions in
the market at that time.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale (Neutral; Price Target: $402.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial accounts. Our
long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable market, superior
technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive
advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels, and we are concerned
about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle moderates.
Valuation
We are lowering our December 2025 price target from $412 to $402 to reflect our lower
EPS estimates. Our price target assumes a 4x multiple on 2026E BV and a 19x multiple on
2026E operating income. These target multiples are well above peers', which we think is
supported by KNSL's above-average premium growth (mid-teens growth versus mid- to
high-single-digit growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile (high 70s to
low 80s CR versus 85-90% for peers). KNSL trades at 6.7x BV, well above specialty peers
of 2.3x and commercial peers at 1.7x. On 2025E earnings, KNSL trades at 24x versus 16x
for specialty insurers and 12x for commercial insurers.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher prices and
greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If current conditions
persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our forecasts and investor
sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We would
expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds growth
expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving could lead to
margin improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin improvement tracks
higher than expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push-back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market, and clients are
pushing back more strongly on price hikes, while more insurers are deploying capital
and positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to turn, there is a risk of
multiple compression for insurers that have seen an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation could reemerge in casualty reserves.
Although unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and low
limits, the reopening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up liability claims.
· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has a
strong underwriting track record, and it is entering new lines in a strong part of the cycle.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
Coverage Universe: Singzon, Pablo S: Bowhead (BOW), Fidelis Insurance (FIHL), Goosehead (GSHD), Hagerty (HGTY), Kinsale (KNSL),
Palomar (PLMR), TWFG Insurance (TWFG), The Baldwin Group (BWIN)
