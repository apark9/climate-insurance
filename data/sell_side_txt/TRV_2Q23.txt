Earnings Revised - July 20, 2023

The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
TRV: It's Raining Rate; Conference Call Round-Up
Our Call
TRV shares traded up modestly as the stronger-than-expected BI margin benefited from
1.5 points of favorable property results plus the company saw adverse development in BI.
The stock from here: TRV traded up on the day given the better-than-expected BI
margins and re-acceleration of BI RPC including both RRC and exposure. While the
improvement in rate was good there were a few other issues weighing on the stock, in our
view: (1) the BI RPC benefited from property accounting for 21% of domestic premiums
in the quarter (vs 13% in Q1), (2) there was ~$350M of unfavorable development in BI ex.
WC releases and (3) personal auto is still not at written price adequacy.
Estimate and price target changes: Our 2023 EPS estimate goes to $12.30 (from
$13.50), 2024 EPS goes to $18.15 (from $18.35) and our 2025 EPS goes to $20.50
(from $21.00) to reflect weaker personal auto results, higher interest expense, a higher
cat load and lower repurchases in 2H 2023. Our price target is unchanged at $185 based
off 10.2x 2024E EPS and 1.66x 2024E book value.
Read thrus: (1) Continued firming in commercial pricing aided by seasonally higher
property renewals, (2) exposure re-accelerated, which should bode well for the brokers,
(3) personal auto severity remains stickier than expected with loss costs in the low double
digits, and (4) TRV added to its reinsurance program and pointed to repurchases being
lower in the second half given the outsized cat losses to start the year, which we could
potentially see from others.
BI margin benefited from favorable non-cat losses. BI saw an underlying combined ratio
of 89.4%, a 3 point improvement Y/Y, with a 2.5 point benefit from favorable property
losses, implying 50bps of core improvement. The 50 bps was driven by earned rate
exceeding los trend. BI saw $101M of PYD, including $350M of strengthening ex comp
driven by other liability lines led by umbrella. Even with the reserve strengthening, TRV
said they did not change their 5.5-6.0% loss trend assumption.
Personal auto still struggling: TRV did not reach its target of written price adequacy
by mid-year given loss costs is stickier than expected, with severity remaining in the low
double digits. They expect the auto RPC to continue to rise from here, but they did not
provide a timeline on when they expect to reach price adequacy. The higher severity is
being a higher mix of accidents that involve BI coverages, which is offsetting some PD
easing, particularly from wholesale prices.

Takeaways for the Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us, and the laterals for the rest of the group are below.
Net-net, the biggest takes are that TRV continues to see pretty poor personal auto results (although
the margin did improve sequentially), commercial lines continue to see strong rate including sequential
accelerations in both rate and exposure, and investment income continues to be a strong tailwind for
earnings as they raised their NII guide. TRV also saw a sizable reserve increase for other liability lines
within BI, and we expect there to be a focus on reserve movement we see from other insurers this
quarter. Highlights of the laterals that we see for the group follow below:
· Commercial lines pricing momentum continues. TRV said that its renewal rates in BI were +7.2%
in Q2, accelerating sequentially from +4.7% in Q1 showed a continued firm market. We suspect
the higher property renewal (21% of total domestic BI premiums in the quarter vs 14.6% in Q1) in
the Q2 had some impact on the higher rate but TRV said every line in BI saw a sequential increase
vs the Q1 showing broad-based strength. The strong pricing and strong new business growth in
commercial in addition to TRV saying loss costs have not significantly changed is a positive for
the commercial peers, and the seasonally higher property renewal in the Q2 should boost rates
and exposures for the group.
· Exposure growth accelerates sequentially. Exposure growth saw a sequential uptick in BI in Q2
as TRV saw exposure growth of 5.6% vs the 4.7% in Q1. When looking at the RPC, the higher RRC
and exposure growth led to an RPC of 12.8%, which was a record-high for TRV. The re-acceleration
of exposure growth should be a good sign for all insurance brokers. Further, TRV is more of a
small-middle market insurer (RPC was up a point in Select and more than two points in Middle
Market), it is the best take for AJG and BRO, but does point to a potentially good quarter for
the brokerage group in general.
· Personal auto continues to see elevated margins. TRV printed a 103.5% personal auto underlying
combined ratio, remaining above the company target of mid-90s to perhaps a range above the
upper-end of the mid-90s. RPC was 16.1% in the quarter, accelerating from 14.0% in the prior
quarter but TRV noted they are still not at written price adequacy, which they previously guided
to, given severity has remained stickier than their expectations with loss trends in the low double
digits. These results highlight personal auto carriers are still higher severity than they originally
expected, pushing out the timeline on when carriers can return to target margins.
· Adds to its reinsurance coverage. TRV increased their coverage under the NE property treaty
by fully placing the $850M layer above the attachment point of $2.5B (vs last year they placed a
$750M layer above a $2.25B attachment point). They also added a new hurricane cat excess of
loss reinsurance program in their personal insurance property book that provided 50% coverage
for the $1.0B layer above the attachment point of $1.75B. They said the margin impact of this
new program was de-minimis and the overall impact from higher reinsurance program across all
programs should little or no impact on expected margins given the rate they are taking (which is
offsetting the higher costs). We expect other insurers to potentially add to their programs for
the back half of this year given cats are on a record-pace to begin the year.
· Point to repurchases being lower in the second half. With the higher cat losses to start the year
and going into wind season, TRV pointed to repurchases being lower in the second half vs the
first half. We could see other companies pullback on repurchases in the back half to preserve
capital, especially depending on the updated reinsurance programs at mid-year renewals where
retentions are higher.
. After-tax fixed Income NII revised up. The company raised its fixed income net investment guide
to $570M for Q3 (from $555M) and $595M in Q4 (from $570M). We believe this could perhaps
point to modestly higher investment income at other players, although we do not expect much
to provide specific NII guidance as most carriers don't provide specific guidance (CB guides one
quarter ahead).

What the Companies Are Saying-TRV
Outlook. When asked about their loss cost assumptions of 5.5% to 6.0%, TRV pointed to loss costs
not being significantly different even after adding to their umbrella reserves within Business Insurance.
They did not give a specific margin guide but did agree with the statement that if their loss costs are
fairly unchanged and RPC is accelerating, they should be able to improve their margins. TRV pointed
to reinsurance costs being higher at mid-year renewals and highlighted a new program they added
that will provide protection for hurricane losses for their personal insurance property boo. The new
program provides 50% coverage above a $1.75B attachment point up to $1.0B coverage and covers
all US coastal states from Texas to Maine, excluding Florida. The overall higher reinsurance costs and
the new reinsurance treaty should have little to no impact on margins as they are passing on the higher
costs through rate.
Pricing. Within personal lines, TRV guided to RPC in auto accelerating from here for the remainder
of the year (16.1% in Q2) and home RPC remaining at the high-teens for the remainder of the year
(19.2% in Q2). They did not provide a timeline for when auto would reach written price adequacy within
personal auto given it depends on how quickly rates get approved, how fast inflation comes down, and
how loss experience trends from here.
Guidance. The exhibit below highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2023.
· Fixed income investment guide raised. The only precise guidance that Travelers provides is
around its quarterly view for fixed income plus short-term investment income, on an after-tax
basis. TRV is now looking for fixed income and short-term investment income to be $570 million
after-tax in Q3 and $595 million in Q4. This is up from the previously guided $555M for Q3 and
$575M for Q4.
. Personal lines RPC guide. Within personal auto, TRV said they are not at written price adequacy
as of mid-year as previously guided to given severity has remained stickier in the low double digits.
They expect RPC to climb from the 16.0% in Q2 for the remainder of the year while they expect
home to remain in the high-teens (was 19.2% in Q2).
. Lower repurchases in the back half. Given the outsized cats they have seen to start the year,
TRV pointed to repurchases being lower in the back half of this year when compared to the first
half of the year when they bought back $862 million. TRV has $6.2B left under its repurchase
authorization as of 6/30.
Investments. TRV raised their fixed income and expects after-tax investment income of $570M in Q3
(up from $555M prior) and $595 million in Q4 (up from the prior $575 million). The non-fixed income
portfolio delivered positive returns (4.0% in the quarter), which was higher than the 2.8% in Q1 but
below the 10.2% return in the prior year quarter. As of 6/30, real estate and real estate partnerships
accounted for 31% of their non-fixed portfolio (vs 33% in the prior quarter) but remains a miniscule
portion of the entire portfolio at 2.2% of their total invested portfolio.
Liquidity and Capital. TRV has $2.0 billion of capital at the holding company (up from just under $1.5
billion at the end of 2022 and the $1.6B at end of Q1) with all of their capital ratios at or better than
target levels. They issued $750M of 30-year senior notes (5.45% annualized coupon) in May (priced
5/22) to fund business growth bringing their debt to capital ratio to 23.3%, which is still within their
target range of 15-25%.

Highlights of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of our estimate changes. The exhibit below highlights the changes we made to our earnings
model following Q2 2023 earnings.
· 2023 EPS goes down to $12.30 (from $13.50) to the higher cats/PYD in the Q1 results, a higher
interest expense, and a higher share count given lower repurchases in the second half of this year,
partially offset by a lower tax rate in the Q1 results and better underlying margins in Business
Insurance.
. 2024 EPS goes down to $18.15 (from $18.35) to reflect a higher cat load, a higher share count
(as a result of lower repurchases in 2023), and higher interest expense partially offset by modestly
higher Nll and better underlying margins in Business Insurance.
. 2025 EPS is revised down to $20.50 (from $21.00) to mainly reflect a higher cat load, a higher
share count (as a result of lower repurchases in 2023), higher interest expense, and a modestly
higher assumed expense ratio.

Pricing Highlights-Personal Lines
Personal Lines-TRV Continues to See Rate Acceleration, Margins Remain Elevated
· Within Personal Auto, TRV saw renewal premium change continue to accelerate sequentially at
16.1%, which was up from the 14.0% last quarter; however, their auto underlying margin remained
above 100% for the fifth straight quarter (103.5% in Q2) and was up 1.7 points Y/Y highlighting
the need for additional rate (and the lag in these rates earning through) and was modestly higher
vs the 103.4% in the Q1, which is a seasonally favorable quarter. TRV said they are not at written
price adequacy, missing their previous guide of being close to or at written price adequacy, which
is not surprising given the monthly results we have seen from PGR in the Q2. They expect RPC
to continue to rise from these levels for the remainder of the year but did not give a timeline on
reaching price adequacy. They said severity has proven stickier than previously expected, currently
in the low double digits.
· Homeowners' RPC decelerated modestly sequentially to 19.2% from the record-high 19.9% in
Q1 but remains at strong levels. They expect the RPC in home to remain in the high-teens for the
remainder of the year.
· Auto PIFs decline sequentially, while home modestly up. Travelers' new business in auto
decreased 7% Y/Y to $297 million, after decreasing 4% Y/Y last quarter and marked the third
straight quarter with Y/Y declines as TRV continues to pull new business away from states where
they are not getting enough rate and abiding by stricter underwriting standards. This is also
reflected in the PIF numbers, as auto PIFs declined 0.7% sequentially, which was the second
straight sequential decline after Q1 saw the biggest sequential drop since Q1 2014. Home new
business was up 2% Y/Y at $321 million and up from the flat Y/Y growth in the prior quarter. From
a PIF standpoint, home saw a 0.5% sequential increase, which was a slowdown from the 1.4%
sequential increase last quarter.

Valuation
Current valuation. The TRV shares are now trading at 1.81x Q2 2023 book value, which is above its 5-
year (1.47x) average, and its 10-year (1.41x) average multiple but below the peak level of 2.05x. The

investment portfolio vs historical averages; when excluding unrealized losses (net), shares are currently
trading at 1.42x Q2 adjusted book of $121.71, which is modestly above the 1.37x 5-year average ex

Equity Research
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the hard commercial market as pricing should continue to have legs given inflation and
higher weather volatility. Although we are positive on the commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers
due to its smaller account exposure, higher workers' comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes, and personal
lines exposure, particularly auto, which is well above target margins of mid-90s. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation,
lower reserve releases, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral and rate
the shares Equal Weight as a result.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $185.00 from NC
Our price target of $185 is based on around a ~1.7x multiple of our projected 2024 book value estimate of around $111 and just over 10x
our 2024 EPS estimate of $18.15.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and reported / underlying margins coming in better
than expected.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
