Unchanged
AIG still seems to be busy talking to many market constituents from private buyers
to rating agencies to bankers in the many months since its announced intent to
separate L&R. All we know at this point is that AIG will not have to raise equity
capital and an initial 19.9% minority sale is still sticking. We see it as a good sign
that subsidiary capital is strong enough to stand on its own two feet. This leaves
some room for potential buybacks and M&A, a different tone from being more
narrowly focused on delivering its debt load. AIG had also been busy talking to their
reinsurance partners as it has updated its treaties to reflect its re-underwriting
efforts and over-indexing to the market. With greater retention levels we expect to
see more recognizable premium growth, albeit the ultimate level should still be
impacted from recessionary pressures. Still, we think until now reinsurers have
benefitted the most from AIG's price increases.
If there is any voice left AIG will be toasting Brian Duperreault off with salutations
of 10 quarters of steady improvements in underlying underwriting results. Despite
this achievement, we still think it will take more time for AIG to achieve AYCR (ex cat) of
<90% by exit '22. We are concerned that AIG strengthened reserves in recent accident
years notably '17 and '16 that are out of scope with its ADC. Also, prior management
had to raise loss picks in the midst of those calendar years to provide an extra boost.
Tempering our view is compounded rate increases and remediation since then. Even so,
AIG's re-underwriting efforts at this stage feel a bit transient.

Estimates and valuation: We are raising our price target to $43 from $41 and
maintaining our EW rating on AIG. We are slightly updating our '21 EPS estimates from
$4.12 to $4.20 to reflect $500mn of anticipated buybacks in 1H21. Our valuation
reflects reflecting a 50/50 weighting of 10x P/E multiple on our '22 EPS estimate of
$4.60 (+$0.17) and 0.66x P/BV on our '22 BVPS of $61.80 (-$0.95).

Price Target
USD 43.00
Why Equal Weight? We view AIG as a wait-and-see
proposition in response to its state of transition.
Conceptually breaking off L&R makes sense, we just
anticipate several first order and second order
consequences. We anticipate many moving parts to
reach a pro-forma capital structure.
Upside case
USD 51.00
A successful separation of L&R comes with the least
org. distractions and does not require significant calls
on capital. We like management's vision of orderly
pace starting with an initial minority IPO or private
sale. Our upside case of $51 assumes 11.1x our '22
EPS estimate.
Downside case
USD 35.00
Adverse reserve development accompanying
expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too
soon. Our downside case of $35 assumes 7.6x our
'22 EPS estimate.

Low
Downside
AIG reported 4Q20 operating EPS of $0.94 above our $0.90 estimate and the $0.93
consensus estimate. The beat to our estimate was $41mn of due to higher than expected
returns on alternative investments. On an after-tax basis, notable items include: $484mn of
excess alternative returns or $0.56 EPS impact and $32mn of better than expected valuation
on fixed maturities under the fair value accounting option or $0.04 EPS impact.
The combined ratio for the General Insurance business of 102.8% was above our
expectations due to higher catastrophes (including COVID); however, the underlying
combined ratio was better than our expectations benefiting from both the AY loss ratio and
acquisition ratio side reflecting mix shift and rate momentum.
L&R Separation
AIG is open to a minority IPO or sale to private buyers but is still sticking to its 19.9% initial
sale target. We think AIG will only entertain offers from serious buyers but it seems that
18 February 2021
2
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
some that have come through the door pass the quality test. When choosing a private buyer
AIG is more motivated on the long-term prospects of the L&R platform rather than a means
to an end. So not a yard sale but an enterprise that is still focused on origination, in our
view. AIG is also considering execution certainty and pressures from rating agencies and
regulators.
Capital Management
AIG did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we had anticipated. Despite strong
parent company liquidity of $10.5bn at YE '20 and $9bn at February 1st (after factoring in its
debt redemption) and some latitude for buybacks with $500mn earmarked for 1H21, it will
carry lesser emphasis. AIG will likely prioritize capital to delever its debt. AIG's sentiment
that it does not have to raise equity capital and that subsidiary capital on its own is strong is
reassuring at this stage. Even so, we anticipate AIG is holding dry powder ahead of the L&R
separation in case there is any calls on capital. At least we have seen that happen with other
life insurance separations.
Underwriting Performance
. The reported combined ratio for NA commercial lines was 112.4% versus our
97.3% all in estimate. The underlying combined ratio for NA commercial lines
was 93.6% versus our 93.8% estimate. The driver for the higher ratio was higher
catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio improved 4 points relative to the
prior year period and reflected improved business mix along with rate increases.
· The combined ratio for NA personal lines business was 133.2% versus our
119.1% all in estimate. The underlying combined ratio for NA personal lines was
102.6%, versus our 115.0%, an increase of 10.4 points from the prior year
period. Results were worse than expected due to higher catastrophes in
particular Covid-19 impact on the travel business and change in business mix.
. The combined ratio for International commercial lines was 92.1% versus our
101.6% all in estimate. The underlying combined ratio for International
commercial lines was 89.2% versus our 92.5% estimate an improvement of 4.9
points from the prior year period. Both ratios this quarter were favorable to our
expectations helped likely by improved business mix with rate increases.
· The combined ratio for International personal lines was 95.0% versus our
95.2% all in estimate. The underlying combined ratio for International personal
lines was 94.1% versus our 93.6%. Results were better than expectations due to
lower cats. On an underlying basis, while unfavorable to our estimate,
demonstrated a couple point improvement year-over-year due to lower claims
frequency and change in business mix
. Life & Retirement pretax earnings of $1.207B were ahead of our $787M
estimate benefiting from strong alternative investment income. By business line,
Group Retirement, and Institutional Markets were well ahead of our expectations
driven by higher net investment income. Life Insurance earnings were impacted
by covid-19 mortality and spread compression but NII was also strong in this
segment.
4Q20 NWP better than expected lead by commercial insurance growth
except liability
· North America net written premiums (NWP) were $2.4B in the quarter, down
11% year-over-year, and above our $2.3B estimate. Specifically, commercial
lines NWP were up 10% year-over-year to $2B, modestly below $2.1B estimate,
18 February 2021
3
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
but were aided by strong rate trends and improving retention. Personal lines
NWP were $369 down 55% year-over-year, slightly below our $375M estimate
reflecting the impacts of lower travel business and risk sharing with Syndicate
2019 on PCG.
· International net written premiums were $3.2B flat year-over-year but above our
$2.9B estimate. Specifically, commercial lines NWP were $1.7B up 7% year-over-
year and above our $1.4B projection. Personal lines NWP were $1.5B, down 6%
year-over-year, besting our $1.4B estimate.
· On a line of business standpoint, commercial premiums were up 8.5% year-
over-year driven by a 13.9% increase in Financial Lines, a 17.2% increase in
Specialty, and 21.4% increase in Property which more than offset a 16.2%
decline in Liability premiums. Personal lines premiums were down 22.3% year-
over-year
Renewal rates reflect positive trends in the market
On the earnings call, management discussed the renewal rate changes that they saw in the
fourth quarter. Commercial lines rates grew 15% year-over-year. We are encouraged that
terms and conditions have tightened in the quarter. Management is constructive that rate
momentum is sustainable across all business lines (except workers' compensation).
Rates for NA commercial lines grew 21% year-over-year a strong continuation from the
20% increase in the 3Q. This was driven by rate increases in lines such as excess casualty
which had 45% increase (up from over 30% in 3Q) and financial lines up over 25% (similar
rate increase to 3Q) led by a 35% increase in D&O. Retail property and Lexington wholesale
property saw increases of 30% and Lexington casualty had a 25% increase.
International commercial lines experienced rate increases of 14% year-over-year in the 4Q
consistent with the robust 14% increase in the 3Q. Rate increases in commercial property
were 15% (up from 12% in the 3Q), financial lines up over 20% (similar to the 3Q) driven by
D&O, global energy experienced a 30% increase, and Talbot received over 15% increases.
Validus materially increased NPW at January 1 signings. Although individual quarter rate
increases are helpful to follow in a vacuum; more telling is the rate on rate impact that AIG
and its peers should continue to experience in commercial lines, in our view. Importantly,
management believes that rates that the company is achieving are outpacing the lost cost
trends.
Breadcrumb Trail ... Forward Looking Management Comments
· AYCR (ex cat) <90% exit '22: Drivers include rate above trend, portfolio repositioning,
greater retention of business (i.e. less reinsurance), and expense ratio savings from AIG
200.
· GI Premiums Mix: International proportion should outweigh domestic business
although North America commercial growth should lessen the skewness somewhat.
· Earned Premiums: Greater recognition of earned premium in '21 from rate increases.
· Reinsurance renewal update: Reduction in property catastrophe reinsurance limit
(unspecified amount) in response to re-underwriting actions that had lowered gross
PMLs. Also, last year's treaty was placed before AIG executed its 75% ceding
arrangement with Syndicate 2019 for $1bn of PCG business, thereby lowering the need
to replicate the same reinsurance structure. While severity protection is down, on the
bright side frequency protection has improved. For NA (except the Southeast and Gulf
region) the retention level per-occurrence dropped from $500mn to $200mn. The NA
18 February 2021

Barclays | AIG, Inc.
the retention level per aggregate protection dropped to $500mn from $750mn. AIG
purchased a CAT program for PCG which did not increase its net limit. Note, Validus is
growing and is out of scope of these treaties. In the past Validus had relied on retro for
protection. We are not updating our expectations for our catastrophe ratio given these
moving parts.
· L&R spread compression: 8 to 16 bps annually
· COVID-19 Life Mortality Sensitivity Analysis: $65-$75mn per 100,000 deaths
· Buybacks: AIG will return at least $500mn in 1H21. AIG also repurchased $92mn of
shares to offset warrant dilution before the January 19, 2021 exercise date.
· Corporate: Lower interest expense and GOE. However, this segment gets noisy with
continued volatility in asset management and in the consolidation and elimination lines
. AIG 200: $650mn of annual run rate savings by YE '21 and $1bn aggregate run rate
savings by YE '22. Total investments offset some of these savings with $500mn
earmarked for '21 and $570mn earmarked for '22. Total investments are $1.3bn.
Estimate Changes
We are raising our operating EPS from $4.12 to $4.20 for 2021 and from $4.43 to $4.60 for
2020. Our estimate changes reflect the reflect $500mn of anticipated buybacks in 1H21.
Raising Price Target to $43, maintain Equal Weight
We are raising our Price Target from $41 to $43 based on higher earnings estimates. We
now base our Price Target on 2022 estimates rather than 2021 as we see 2022 as a more
normalized year for EPS. Our $43 Price Target is based on a 50/50 weighting of 10.0x our
2022E operating EPS of $4.60 and a 0.66x multiple to our 2022E book value per share ex

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

Chubb Limited (CB)

Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $43 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average P/E of 10x our 2022 EPS estimate
of $4.60 and 0.66x YE22 estimated book value per share (ex-AOCI) of $61.80. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group
given we expect lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a
separation. Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to
walk away from business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings
or capital but undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post
separation may temper AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.
