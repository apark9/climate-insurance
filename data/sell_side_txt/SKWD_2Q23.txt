2Q23 Review: Rate Acceleration
Double digit pure rates (highest on record since CEO arrival) and
strong GWP continuing in July. Rate increases are broad based,
with the greatest uplift seen in Global Property.

Rates vs. Loss trends: Pure rates in double digits (vs. high single digits last quarter) are
above loss cost inflation. 2Q marks the highest pure rate achieved since Mr. Robinson joined the
organization in May 2020. Every underwriting division was at or above where it was last quarter.
Specifically, global property rates increased significantly. Exposure growth was in the low-to-
mid single digits (vs a couple of points last quarter). Loss cost inflation across the book is ~5-6%
with personal injury exposed classes in the high single-digits. Importantly, the rate above loss
cost is not reflected in SKWD's loss picks.

Per our subsequent conversation with the CFO, we understand SKWD establishes its loss picks
every Sept. for the upcoming calendar year. Mechanically this means if the denominator, NPE, is
rising from higher rates, then SKWD increases the numerator to arrive at its established loss
picks, which feels conservative. SKWD typically waits 3 years to reflect positive trends in its
current vs. initial loss ratios.
Strong GWP growth: 2Q GWP grew by 29.4% y/y as five out of eight underwriting divisions
delivered 20%+ y/y growth and all eight divisions grew y/y. Submission counts were up ~20% y/y
and in-force unit count increased 14% y/y and 3% q/q. Management shared that July continued
to be a positive environment for growth and they are "hopeful" it will continue.

Net premium retention. Retention decreased to ~51% in 2Q23 vs. ~ 58% in 2Q22 due to
business mix shift and growth in Global Property and Agriculture where SKWD has lower
retention. Management expects retention to be lower in H1 2023, higher in H2 2023, netting
slightly higher in FY2023 vs. FY2022.

AYLR 210 bps improvement y/y due to business mix changes and runoff of higher loss ratio
exited business. SKWD has not shared prior period loss ratios of exited businesses. For
conservatism, SKWD is not emphasizing rate ahead of loss trends as a key driver of underlying
margin expansion. AYLR of 60.7% beat our 61.1% estimate. We think SKWD's 60.7% AYLR
achievement is not an anomaly and we can see continued underlying margin expansion from
here.

Sub-30% expense ratio guidance reiterated; we expect upside. SKWD's 28.0% expense ratio
in 2Q23 was helped by better than expected NPE earning in. Management maintained it's sub-
30% expense ratio guidance. The company will continue to invest in the business and expects a
higher run rate in the back half of 2023.

Cat loads. 2Q catastrophe losses of $6.8mn were worse than our modeled $1.8mn. The losses
were related to 3 events: a tornado that hit a high value building, an HVAC/equipment storage
area that incurred losses, and a hail related loss. SKWD will inevitably pick up some cat
exposure from growing its Global Property business. In contrast, property within its
Transactional E&S business is more prone to fire perils than cat-like perils. We increase our cat
load estimates to reflect growth within global property.
Ceded Re Strategy: Incrementally, we learned that its risk adjusted reinsurance pricing for
property catastrophe risk at 5/1 was 15-20%. This added reinsurance costs does not compress
underwriting margins given prop cat is a relatively smaller portion of overall transactional E&S
and global property pricing.
Reinsurance risk management. Exposure to reinsurance is predominately in the loss portfolio
transfer (which is fully collateralized) and captives divisions. SKWD works with a trusted set of
banks and captive managers to mitigate third party risk and also takes full credit for them
statutorily.
Valuation. We reiterate our Overweight rating and $29 PT which is based on a 50/50 weighted
12.5x (unchanged) P/E multiple on our '24 EPS estimate of $2.39 (from $2.32) and 1.85x
(unchanged) P/TBV excluding AOCI on our '24 TBVPS excluding AOCI of $15.48 (from $15.40).

Why OVERWEIGHT?
E&S writers trade at a premium to
admitted writers. SKWD's multiple
could increase over time as the E&S
becomes a larger piece of their
overall mix from its current ~50%,
achievable within transactional E&S
and property. SKWD's stock
performance could hinge more on
execution than peers given a
shorter operating history under the
current management team.
Upside case
USD 32.00
Over time, multiple expansion
could come from the shift of
business mix towards the E&S
market and we expect underwriting
profitability to improve in
2023/2024. Our upside case is based
on a ~13x P/E '24 and 2.1x TBVPS for
common shareholders ex AOCI '24.
Downside case
USD 20.00
A slowdown in the E&S market and
unforeseen reserving issues from
their LPT transaction could lead to
sentiment risk compared to peers.
Our downside case is based on a
~8x P/E '24 and 1.3x TBVPS for
common shareholders ex AOCI '24.

2Q23 Highlights
Operating earnings miss: SKWD reported 2Q23 adjusted net operating earnings of $16.0mn or
$0.42 per share, which was worse than our estimate of $19.2mn or $0.49 per share. The Street
was at $0.39 per share. The earnings miss is due to higher than expected catastrophe losses.
2Q23 GWP growth: SKWD GWP grew by 29.4% y/y (vs. our 14.4% estimate). Double-digit
premium increases were broad based, seen across transactional E&S, global property and
agriculture, professional lines, and surety and captives.
Underwriting performance: SKWD's combined ratio was 92.0% vs. our estimate of 91.1%.
Expense ratio in 2Q23 of 28.0% was better than our estimate of 29.0% amid a higher than
expected commission/fee income contra expense. Management's view is for a more sustainable
expense ratio near 30% going forward given the investments it is making for growth (as shared
in 1Q). Accident Year Loss Ratio (AYLR), ex cats, LPT and non-LPT, was 60.7%, 210 bps y/y
improvement and better than our estimate of 61.1%. Total company Accident Year Combined
Ratio (AYCR), ex cats, LPT and non-LPT, was 88.7% vs. our 90.1% estimate. 2Q catastrophe
losses of $6.8mn were worse than our modeled $1.8mn.
Net Investment Income (NII): SKWD reported $8.6mn of net investment income vs. our
estimate of $10.1mn. The positive $7.0mn contribution from core fixed income outweighed the
$2.4mn drag from opportunistic fixed income. Opportunistic fixed income was impacted due to
a reduction in FMV of LLPs during 2Q23 and 1H23 vs. same periods last year. In 2Q23, SKWD
invested ~$116mn in the core fixed income portfolio at 5.2% without increasing duration. The
embedded yield on the portfolio is >4%. The yield on short-term investments was >5%;
management continues to deploy this liquidity into core fixed income.
Operating ROE (annualized) of 12.4% was worse than our estimated 14.9% due to higher
catastrophe losses.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: For our $29 PT, we are using a 50/50 weighted 12.5x P/E multiple on our '24 EPS estimate and 1.85x P/TBV excluding AOCI on
our '24 TBV ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Greater variability of net investment income
stemming from its "opportunistic fixed income fund" (i.e. 19% of its investment portfolio and 60% of NII for YTD3Q22). This fund is originated and
9 August 2023

Barclays | Skyward Specialty Insurance Group, Inc.
managed by Arena, another Westaim subsidiary. Albeit, SKWD is winding down the opportunistic fixed income fund. Higher dependence on
reinsurance than established peers. SKWD is not immune to the secular challenges posed by the commercial auto insurance market (25% DPW for
YTD3Q22). SKWD was able to achieve sub 30% GWP growth in its core businesses over the last 2 years, with a notable step down in growth to sub 10%
level anticipated in 2023E. As the bulk of IPO proceeds are pushed down to the operating companies it remains to be seen if these proceeds are truly
funding future growth or back filling historical growth that had already consumed statutory capitalization.

Barclays Israeli branch previously held an investment marketing license with the Israel Securities Authority but it cancelled such license on 30/11/2014

information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
