TRV: Strong Start to P&C Earnings; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
TRV hosted a conference call on 1/21 to discuss Q4 results. The call focused on the
impact from the ongoing pandemic, loss trends, pricing, and capital. Our 2021 EPS
estimate rises to $10.85 (from $10.35) and 2022 rises to $11.95 (from $11.55)
reflecting better underlying loss ratio trends (principally within Business Insurance and
personal auto). We also made modest changes to our cat losses and premium growth
assumptions. Our initial 2023 EPS estimate is $12.80 and our price target rises to $150
(from $145) and is based on 1.15x our 2022E book value. TRV shares outperformed
today thanks to its EPS beat and positive outlook around margins and their benefit from
the hardening market, in our view.
TRV is the first company to report earnings under coverage, and provides several read-
throughs for the group: (1) pricing momentum, (2) underlying margin improvement,
(3) return to capital management, and (4) stronger alternative NII combined with
an unchanged NII guide for 2021. We believe that TRV is poised to benefit from the
hardening market given that 65% of its business comes from commercial lines. However,
TRV has more smaller and medium account exposure that some peers (AIG and CB) and
does have high workers comp exposure (which is the only line not seeing positive pricing).
As we begin to see more margin improvement from increasing rates, we would expect
valuation metrics to expand for the P&C sector. Against this backdrop, our top ideas
are ones that we believe are best positioned to take advantage from the strong pricing
environment, and see the greatest level of margin improvement. This includes stocks that
we think could positively surprise with Q4 earnings including Overweight-rated primary
writers CB, ACGL and HIG.
· Underlying margin improvement picked up and positive lateral for the group.
Rate exceeded loss trend in Business Insurance (BI) by 150-200 basis points. Moving
forward, the company noted that it expects the favorable rate environment to persist
and result in expanding margins in BI. We think this is one of the more important
takeaways from TRV's earnings and a positive lateral for the commercial insurers (AIG,
CB and HIG) and supports our overall thesis on the group for incremental margin
improvement to show up in Q4 2020 numbers - for more see our recent note: P&C
Insurance: No Hard Market Love.
. Level of direct Covid-19 losses slowing. TRV saw $31 million of pre-tax direct losses
(down from $133 million in Q3) attributable to Covid-19, which was split evenly
between BI and Bond & Specialty. However, these losses were more than offset by a
lower level of auto claims which resulted in a net benefit of 2.5 points in the Q4. This
benefit could wane, however, as driving returns to more normalized levels.
· Investment income headwinds seem to largely be in estimates. TRV benefited from
stronger alternative investment results (which we could see across the sector in the
quarter). Further, the quarterly NII guide was unchanged for 2021 to us showing that
the impact of lower interest rates is largely in estimates at this point (see our recent
note: P&C Insurance: Margin And NII Deep Dive).
· A return to buyback is a positive. TRV did return to share repurchases, buying back
$201 million in the Q4 after not repurchasing any shares in Q3 and Q2. We believe
the return to buyback sends the signal that the worst of the Covid-19 uncertainty is
behind us.

Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 1/21 to discuss Q4 results. The call focused on the impact
from the ongoing pandemic, loss trends, pricing, and capital. Our 2021 EPS estimate rises to $10.85
(from $10.35) and 2022 rises to $11.95 (from $11.55) reflective better underlying loss ratio trends
(principally within Business Insurance and personal auto). We also made modest changes to our
expense ratio, cat loss, and premium growth assumptions. Most of other assumptions, including
investment income, are unchanged. Our initial 2023 EPS estimate is $12.80 and our price target rises
to $150 (from $145) and is based on 1.15x our 2022E book value. TRV shares outperformed today
thanks to its EPS beat and positive outlook around margins and their benefit from the hardening
market. We were surprised other primary insurers did not respond favorably to TRV earnings but we
believe part of this was due to the adverse BI ruling against Zurich. The majority of cases to-date have
sided with the industry and we continue to not be overly concerned from a BI perspective.
The Quarter In A Nutshell. This morning (1/21), TRV reported Q4 core EPS of $4.91, beating both
our $3.85 estimate, and the $3.18 consensus estimate. TRV's results beat on better underlying results
and stronger favorable reserve development (a good portion from workers' comp) and extremely low
cat losses. NPW rose by 2.7%, in-line with our estimate and the Q3. NII was $677 million, better than
our $593 million estimate with the upside mostly due to other investments. The underlying combined
ratio of 88.7% beat our 89.9% estimate with all segments beating us (the net Covid-19 impact is given
on the conf call). Cats were only $29 million, lower than our $115 million estimate. TRV repurchased
$201 million shares, ahead of our $150 million estimate and the first time the company has bought
back shares since Q1 2020. Book value per share rose by 5.2% and the core ROE was 20.5%.

2021 Outlook
2021 outlook. Exhibit 2 below highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2021. TRV did
not provide specific 2021 guidance, which is consistent with previous quarters in 2020 after TRV
pulled its outlook in Q1 2020 for renewal premium change and its underlying margins as a result of
the uncertainty associated with the potential impacts associated with Covid-19. TRV did provide an
outlook for net investment income, and also provided helpful color around other line items in the
model. TRV still expects 2021 fixed income NII to be in the $420-430 million range per quarter
on an after-tax basis in 2021. TRV did not call out any alternative investment income trends. For
catastrophe losses, TRV highlighted it renewed its cat treaties for 2021 with some modest changes
(more details below). TRV did not point to a specific level of share repurchases and noted that it
cannot perpetually return 100% of earnings in the form of dividends and repurchases as it needs to
hold some capital for growth. However, we believe the return to buyback sends the signal that the
worst of the Covid-19 uncertainty is behind us. In Business Insurance, TRV highlighted about $16
million of direct Covid-19 related losses (and only a very minimal frequency benefit), but did say that it
expects the favorable rate environment to persist and result in expanding margins. For reference, rate
exceeded by 150-200 basis points in Q4 for BI. Bond and Specialty expects to see its 2021 underlying
combined ratio improve a little bit from the ~87% it saw in H2 2020. Personal lines results benefited
from favorable frequency and the company continues to observe lower claim frequency as a result
of fewer miles driven due to the ongoing impact from the pandemic, but margins are not likely to be
as strong moving forward. We estimate that 8 of the 12 points of improvement in auto was related
to favorable frequency. On the expense ratio, TRV highlighted that they are comfortable with the
expense ratio being around the 30% range.

Pricing momentum continuing in commercial lines. Business Insurance renewal rate change was
+8.4%, improving from +8.1% in the Q3, +7.4% in the Q2 and +6.0% in the Q1. We had expected about
100 bps of improvement, although there was a good amount of improvement in Select and Middle
Market, while National Property rates slowed in the quarter. Exposure growth was -1.1%, in-line with
Q3. TRV also noted that it achieved higher rates in all business lines away from workers' comp. Further,
TRV saw 3% premium growth in the quarter driven by strong renewal rate change across the book and
continued strong retention in all three segments.

Takeaways For The Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us and the laterals for the rest of the group are below. Net-
net, the biggest take is confirmation in the positive pricing environment and the potential for the P&C
group to see a good amount of underlying margin improvement in 2021.
Commercial lines pricing continues to firm and picked up in the Q4 with renewal rates up 8.4% in
business insurance, improving from 8.1% in the Q3. TRV said that it continues to achieve higher rates
broadly across its book as rate increases in all lines (away from workers' comp) were higher in Q4. This
continued rate firming is positive for the commercial insurers (AIG, CB and HIG) and specifically
AIG and CB where workers' comp represent a smaller portion of their book, in our view.
1. Underlying margin in Business Insurance benefited from rate exceeding trend. TRV said that earned
rate exceeded loss trend in the range of 1.5-2.0 points in Business Insurance, which is a good level
of improvement from 1 point in Q3 2020 and trails the past hard market levels. This supports
our thesis that the margin improvement/earnings estimates across the street will pick up with
earnings (see our recent note: P&C Insurance: No Hard Market Love). TRV also said that it expects
the favorable rate environment to persist and result in expanding margins in Business Insurance.
To us, this points to strong underlying margins for the group in the Q4, with the potential for
greater improvement in 2021 as higher rates are earned in. This would be a positive as well for the
commercial lines insurers, including AIG, CB and HIG.
2. Covid-19 losses slowed and were more than offset by favorable frequency trends. TRV's saw $31 million
of pre-tax gross losses attributable to Covid-19 (down from $133 million in Q3), which was split
evenly between BI and Bond & Specialty. TRV noted that the net impact from Covid-19 was a
2.5 point benefit to its underlying combined ratio primarily coming from Personal Insurance, as
it experienced a lower level of auto claims in both Personal Insurance, and also saw a frequency
benefit within BI. For full-year 2020, Covid-19 benefited underlying margins by about 1 point. TRV
did note that Bond & Specialty's underlying margin deteriorated by 3.7 points and was attributable
to the impact of higher loss estimates for management liability coverages which were primarily
losses attributable to Covid-19 related economic conditions. However, TRV expects to see its 2021
Bond & Specialty underlying combined ratio improve a little bit from the ~87% it saw in H2 2020.
Overall, this should be a benefit to commercial insurers as we expect to see additional Covid-19
related losses for these names but the potential for improved underlying margins from lower
claims frequency could help offset ongoing pandemic related losses.
3. Personal auto continues to see favorable benefits from the ongoing pandemic, but margins could
normalize. TRV's Personal Auto book saw continued benefits to its margin from lower claims
frequency as a result of fewer miles driven. The Personal Auto segment's underlying margin came in
at 88%, improving by almost 12 points with about 1/3 of that related to favorable re-estimates for
prior quarters in 2020 and the remaining 8 points likely due to favorable frequency benefits from
Covid-19. However, TRV said that it would not expect margins to be as strong moving forward and
is reflected in its recent pricing actions. We think this is a positive lateral for the personal auto
insurers (ALL and PGR, and HIG within its auto business) for Q4 results who should continue
to benefit from favorable frequency trends in auto, but a negative lateral longer-term as TRV
doesn't expect margins to be as good in 2021 as miles driven normalizes.
4. Net investment income guide is unchanged, which points to the impact of lower rates stabilizing. TRV
maintained its 2021 quarterly fixed income related NII guidance and still expects to report between
$420-430 million per quarter on an after-tax basis, which to us shows that the decline in interest
rates is largely captured within numbers right now. This forecast assumes the benefit of higher
average levels of invested assets to be more than offset by a lower average yield given the lower
rate environment. We expect the low rate environment to be a headwind to all insurers (life and
non-life), although we think this is largely captured in estimates at this point (see our recent
note: P&C Insurance: Margin And NII Deep Dive).
5. Strong alternative investment quarter. Alternative related investment income totaled $182 million
in the Q4, up from $173 million in Q3 2020 and $77 million in Q4 2019. This result is impressive,
particularly given the fact that alt returns were much better in the Q3 then the Q4 (for example
private equity returns were up 2% in Q4 compared to 24% in the Q3). We think alternative related
investment income could surprise to the upside, for both P&C and life insurers, based on TRV's
strong results.
6. Repurchases returned in the Q4 for TRV but still expect more cautious approach from the group. TRV
repurchased $201 million shares in the Q4 after not repurchasing any in both Q3 or Q2, but it did
still sound a bit more cautious on repurchases as some of its capital will be used for growth. We

expect all insurers, P&C and life, to pick up their level of buyback activity in the Q4, especially
given the lower valuations across both the P&C and life insurance sectors.
Covid-19 Thoughts
TRV's Q4 Covid-19 losses offset by favorable frequency. TRV's Q4 results included $31 million of
pre-tax losses attributable to Covid-19, which was split evenly between Business Insurance and Bond
& Specialty. We are forecasting $40 million of Covid-19 related losses (not including the frequency
offsets) in both the Q1 2021 and Q2 2021 with losses split evenly between BI and Bond & Specialty.
TRV noted that the net impact from Covid-19 was a 2.5 point benefit to its underlying combined
ratio primarily coming from Personal Insurance as it experienced a lower level of auto claims in both
Personal Insurance and Business Insurance. There was only a small favorable (in the tenths of points)
frequency benefit for Business Insurance in the Q4 from Covid-19.

Note: $ in millions, except per share data. Note: The Covid-19 loss per share impact is the tax effected loss over each companies' respective
share count. NM indicates values that were not meaningful as their respective operating earnings were negative. Not all companies provided
the quarterly breakdown of Covid-19 losses and their Covid-19 losses to-date are reflected as a total in the cumulative impact column on the
far right columns of the table. The average book value and EPS impact for the group reflects the average of those companies that provided
quarterly Covid-19 data. TRV's overall results have seen frequency benefits that have served to offset the Covid-19 losses.

Highlights Of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of our estimate changes. Exhibit 4 highlights the changes we made to our earnings model
following Q4 2020 earnings. Our 2021 EPS estimate rises to $10.85 (from $10.35) and 2022 rises
to $11.95 (from $11.55) reflective of better underlying loss ratio trends (principally within Business
Insurance and personal auto). We are also introducing our 2023 EPS estimate of $12.80. We also
made modest changes to our expense ratio, cat loss, and premium growth assumptions. Most of other
assumptions, including investment income, are unchanged. See below for more details on our margin
assumptions by segment.
· Within Business Insurance, we are expecting approximately 180 points of rate rate over trend
in 2021 and another 1.3 points in 2022. In 2021, we are assuming a net benefit from Covid-19
of 0.2 in H1 2021 (as gross losses are offset by frequency benefits) with no additional Covid-19
adjustments in H2 2021.
. Within Bond & Specialty, we are assuming a 2021 an underlying margin of 84.5% for the full-year
with a margin of 87.1% in H1 2021 and 82.2% in H2 2021
· Within Personal lines, our personal auto margin assumes a 7 point frequency benefit in Q1 2021
and 5 point benefit in Q2 2021 with no additional frequency benefits in H2 2021.

Pricing Accelerating In Commercial Lines
Business Insurance Rating Environment -TRV Rates Increased As Expected, While Exposure
Declined
· In the Q4, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +8.4% accelerating 30 bps from the
+8.1% (revised lower) in Q3 2020, +7.4% in Q2 2020, and the +6.0% in Q1 2020. Exposure growth
was - 1.1%, unchanged from Q3 2020 (revised up from -1.9%) and better than the -1.9% in Q2
2020 (revised up from -2.7%) and the -0.4% in Q1 (revised up from -0.8%). See Exhibits 4 and 5
below, which shows the recent trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal
rate change.
· TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC as the company is unsure of how the economy
will be impacted from Covid-19. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains
negative in the Q1.

Margins Benefited From Lower Cats And Favorable PYD
Underlying Results Beat With Strong Results In Business Insurance And Personal Auto
· The consolidated combined ratio was 86.7%, beating our 91.0% estimate largely reflective of
a higher level of favorable reserve releases and lower cat losses. Cats of $29 million were well
below our $115 million estimate (and included a release of $40 million from cats from earlier in
2020), while favorable reserve development of $180 million beat our $35 million estimate as
it experienced favorable development in all segments (with the majority from workers' comp
within Business Insurance). The underlying combined ratio of 88.7% beat our 89.9% estimate, and
improved 3.3 points from last year and included a 2.5 point benefit from Covid-19. Underlying
results beat us in Bond and Specialty, Business Insurance, and Personal Insurance
. Catastrophe losses of $29 million and were primarily related to Hurricane Zeta. Recall, TRV's Q4
2019 cat losses included a $101 million benefit from recoveries under its aggregate cat treaty,
however, the coverage this year was exhausted in Q3 2020 and resulted in no recoveries under the
treaty in Q4 2020. The Q4 2020 cats included ~$40 million of favorable development from loss
estimates for events that occurred earlier in the year.
. Reserve releases were $180 million, better than our $35 million estimate due to higher releases
in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty. Most of the upside came from Business Insurance
which saw favorable development of $124 million (significantly better than our $2.5 million and
the highest quarterly level for the segment in three years) as releases in workers' comp were only
partially offset by strengthening for GL for a runoff book of business (for policies from more than
20 years ago).

The Travelers Companies, Inc.
Investment Income And Other
Investment Income Beats Us; 2021 Guidance Unchanged
. Net investment income was $677 million pre-tax, better than our $593 million estimate. Travelers'
after-tax book yield on its investment portfolio was 2.8%, modestly below the 2.9% yield for
Q3 2020. Fixed income investments added $500 million pre-tax, higher than our $487 million
estimate, while alts were $182 million, also higher than our $100 million estimate. Short-term
investments added $3 million, below our $15 million estimate.
. TRV continues to expect its fixed income investment income to total $420-430 million after-tax
for each quarter of 2021 as it is forecasting the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets
to be more than offset by a lower average yield given the lower interest rate environment.
Capital Management - Still Seems Cautious
· TRV repurchased $201 million for 1.4 shares in the Q4, better than our estimate for $150 million
of share repurchases. Dividends were 218 million, bring to total capital return to $419 million,
which compares to the $1.3 billion of core earnings. Total capital return to shareholders was
55% of core earnings in 2020 and we are currently forecasting 87% and 82% in 2021 and 2022,
respectively.
Premium Growth In Line
. Net premiums written rose 2.7%, similar to our 2.6% estimate and in line with the Q4 2020. Results
were ahead of us Bond & Specialty, but missed us in Business Insurance and Personal Lines. Gross
premiums written growth of 3.2% was ahead of our 2.7% estimate and accelerated from 2.8%
laster quarter.
. Business insurance net premiums written were down 1.9% versus our down 1.5% estimate and
down 1.4% in the Q3. Bond & Specialty new premiums written were +12.0% versus our +4.0%
estimate and the +3.6% last quarter. Personal Insurance net premiums written were +7.6% versus
our +6.1% estimate and +6.5% last quarter. Within Personal Insurance, auto net premiums written
of 1.9% missed our +5.0% estimate and decelerated from 4.1% laster quarter, while home net
premiums written growth of 13.0% was ahead of our 10.0% estimate but was lower relative to
14.0% last quarter.
Cat Treaty Renewed
. TRV renewed its cat XOL treaty on terms in line with its expiring treaty and continues to provide
coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. TRV
also renewed its underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty that it first purchased in
2019, and noted this treaty will continue to address qualifying PCS-designated events in North
America for which it incurs losses of $5 million or more, however, the 2021 renewal includes a
$5 million deductible per event. In prior years, PCS designated events that cost more than $5
million counted towards the treaty from dollar one. TRV's treaty covers $500 million (of which
$350 million of qualifying losses are covered by the treaty and $150 million are retained by TRV)
in excess of its aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. The aggregate retention for 2021 increased
from $1.55 billion in 2020 largely reflecting recent years experience and anticipated growth in its
property book.
· TRV noted that hurricane and earthquake events both have a $250 million per occurrence cap
consistent with prior years. In addition, for 2021 wildfires are also capped at $250 million per
event.
. Based on its assumptions around cat and non-cat weather for 2021, TRV expects the full year
impact of the aggregate treaty on its underlying combined ratio to be roughly 0.5 points,
and anticipates only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio. Both of these impacts are
consistent with the assumptions in made in each of the past two years.

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for TRV: $150.00 from $145.00
Our price target of $150 is based on around a 1.15x multiple of our projected 2022 book value estimate of around $129 and 12.6x our
2022 EPS estimate of $11.95.
Risk for TRV
Risks to achieving our price target include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in
loss costs, and a rise in D&O claims.
Investment Thesis
TRV
We believe that TRV will benefit from one of the hardest commercial pricing environment since 2003. Although we are positive on the
commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers due to its smaller account exposure and higher workers'
comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation, lower
reserve releases, and Covid-19, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral.
