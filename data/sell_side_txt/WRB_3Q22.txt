WRB: Leaning Into The Hard Market; Q3 EPS and Conference Call Round-Up
Our Call
Summary. WRB reported Q3 2022 EPS of $1.01 beating our $0.83 and consensus
of $0.85. The upside was driven by: (1) stronger net investment income (in the core
portfolio and its investment funds and arbitrage trading account), and (2) lower corporate
expenses (including $41.1 million of foreign exchange gains), partially offset by slightly
higher cat losses and prior year adverse development. Catastrophe losses came in at
$94.1 million, modestly higher than our $83.0 million estimate, and prior year adverse
reserve development was $39.1 million vs. our estimate for adverse development of
($0.5) million. WRB said that the adverse development (primarily hit the insurance
segment) and stemmed from two isolated and unique events related to Covid-19 and
they would not expect it to recur.
· Mostly unchanged estimates and price target. Following WRB's conference call, we
are raising our 2022 EPS estimate to $4.40 from $4.19, while our 2023 and 2024 EPS
estimates and unchanged at $5.05 and $6.05, respectively. Our price target remains
$85. Shares of WRB are indicating down most likely due to the slightly lower premium
growth and adverse development in the quarter. Given the conservatism at WRB,
combined with their ability to benefit from the harder post Hurricane lan market, we
continue to have an Overweight rating on the shares.
· Pricing got better in the quarter. WRB saw price increases of 7.3%, excluding workers'
comp, improving from 6.8% in Q2. WRB did not want to provide color on pricing in
each specific business line, but did allude to some good opportunities emerging as
they look to flex into short-tail lines on both the insurance and reinsurance side as the
market gets better post Hurricane lan. From their tone throughout the call our sense
is conditions remain strong within the E&S market.
. Color on the adverse reserve development. Berkley saw just around $39 million of
adverse development in the quarter (typical quarterly reserve movements are very
modest for WRB), which they attributed to a couple of Covid-19 claims that they did
not expect to recur. Based on some articles that we have seen we expect the losses
were associated with event cancellation claims from the pandemic.
· Underlying margin was just better than us. The underlying margin (of 86.6%) just
beat us due to an expense ratio that was 10 basis points better than us. Further,
the insurance segment fell short of us, and reinsurance beat us. Our sense is WRB
continues to conservatively set its reserves as the company said that their price
increases are abot 100-200 basis points better than loss trend, but they are not
declaring victory prematurely.
· Premium growth in double digits, but did slow. Net premium written growth was
10.8%, which did represent a slowdown from prior quarters due to lower growth
within professional lines as WRB positions its book in the most profitable business
lines. Further, given how WRB is talking about the potential market improvement in
2023 and its ability to pivot into areas (short-tail lines) that could benefit the most
from Hurricane lan, we think they have the potential to continue to show strong top-
line growth from here.
· See inside for additional takes from the quarter and the conference call incuding
highlights of pricing commentary given by WRB over the past couple of years.

Q3 2022 Beats On Net Investment Income
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q3 2022 EPS of $1.01 beating our $0.83 and consensus of $0.85. The
upside was driven by: (1) stronger net investment income (in the core portfolio and its investment
funds and arbitrage trading account), and (2) and lower corporate expenses (including $41.1 million
of foreign exchange gains), partially offset by slightly higher cat losses and prior year adverse
development. Catastrophe losses came in at $94.1 million, a bit higher than our $83.0 million estimate,
and prior year reserve development was $39.1 million unfavorable vs. our estimate for adverse
development of ($0.5) million. WRB said that the adverse development came from a couple of unique
claims related to Covid-19 and primarily hit the insurance segment (WRB does not give the exact
amount of adverse development by segment until they file their 10-Q). Based on some articles
that we have seen, we expect the losses were associated with event cancellation claims from the
pandemic.Investment income came in at $202.8 million, significantly better than our $147.8 million
estimate.
The underlying combined ratio of 86.6% was just better than our 86.7% estimate, driven by a better
expense ratio (of 28.0%, versus our 28.1% estimate), with the underlying loss ratio coming in at 58.6%
(in-line with our estimate). WRB bought back a modest $6.6 million shares in the quarter (the first
time they have bought back shares since Q3 2021), but it did come in below our $50 million estimate.
The operating ROE was 17.5%, and the net income ROE was 13.8%. Book value per share declined
(2.8%) QoQ.

Highlights of WRB Pricing Thoughts
Healthy pricing trends persist with overall rates accelerating in the Q3. WRB saw price increases of 7.3%, excluding workers' comp
(the price increase with workers' comp will be available with the 10-Q). This improved from 6.8% in Q2, but did represent a slowdown
from 8.3% in Q1 and 9.3% in Q4. Overall, WRB described market conditions as remaining favorable, and echoed comments they made
from a conference presentation in September that they would be willing to potentially increase their property catastrophe reinsurance
exposure if conditions get better (which they are expected to) at January 1, 2023. Exhibit 2 below shows recent commentary that WRB
has provided on pricing since the start of 2020.
Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period
Pricing Comments
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Q3 2022
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to see
resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth target,
which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust. In
workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity and
erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from that.
Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable momentum, up
45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing
is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured
in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious and most of
the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive on WC
pricing in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this stage,
particularly in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any current opportunities.
Q4 2021
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a
growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably attractive.
And we don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related
specialty writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and
even more so in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's
definitely encouraging.
Q3 2021
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers;
compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been
factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate
increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year. The
simple fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that are available in
the business. And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about possibly how we re-prioritize
exposure of growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q2 2021
Period
Pricing Comments
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the prior two being the
early 2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to
take advantage of the hardening market environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three
years, while most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the E&S
market, driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased audit
premiums; and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are at or approaching rate
adequacy with the exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the example
of professional liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more recently and
workers' comp is in a soft market.
June 2021
Non-Deal
Roadshow
(6/21/21)
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting meaningful rate increases.
And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many product lines where we have been getting rate on
rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.
The market is clearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think that is very appropriate. And
whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and 2002 and 2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is,
no cycle looks like any other cycle. When WRB looks at Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers'
compensation, is achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are seeing
meaningful firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella market, while property continues to be
notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL and but over the past couple of quarters that
seems to be building some momentum.
Q4 2020
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are becoming more acute. As far as workers'
compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is more likely than not to begin to firm as we make our way into 2021 or
sometime next year. The loss ratios that WRB selected at the beginning of the year assumed that they would not be outpacing
loss cost trend by the level that they are. The rate increases throughout the year, by and large, are above and beyond what was
anticipated. Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and specifically social inflation, WRB has deliberately decided to take a
wait-and-see attitude.
Q3 2020
We saw the firm market accelerate throughout 2019 and it continued to accelerate into 2020, very evident in Q1. The evidence of
this was demonstrated, at least in part by business leaving the standard market, making its way to the specialty market and in
particular, the E&S market. Rate increases were at a level not seen in some number of years and there was a reduction in
capacity that various carriers were offering. All of these things were being driven by two major factors: (1) low interest rate
environment and a knock-on effect for what that means for investment income; and (2) loss cost trends, driven to a great extent by
social inflation, which had been benign for an extended period of time and then crept up on the industry when it was least
expecting it and it has proven to be much more of an issue.
Q2 2020
Q1 2020 Rate increases that continue to progress in response to past conversations around social inflation and keeping up with loss costs.

Exhibit 3 below shows WRB's pricing trends (excluding Workers' Compensation) relative to
MarketScout since 2017. In Q3, WRB's rate (ex. WC) was 7.3% vs. MarketScout of 3.9%. This compares
to Q2 2022 WRB rate of 6.8%, Q1 2022 of 8.3% and the 2021 average rate of 10.5%. WRB did not
want to provide too much color by business line in terms of what drove the sequential acceleration in
pricing, but they did say that Hurricane lan should drive better pricing in property lines and perhaps
that could expand to other lines, away from property, as well.

Additional Thoughts On The Quarter
See below for an overview of additional thoughts on Q3 2022 earnings versus our estimates.
· Premium growth slowed, but remained in the double digits, with a good forward view. Gross
written premium growth of 10.6% was below our 15.6% estimate, while net written premium
growth of 10.8% also came in below our 14.9% estimate (and slowed from 16.9% in Q2). By
segment, insurance net written premium growth of 11.5% missed our 15.7% estimate, due
to lower growth in professional lines (-1.6% as compared to our +5% estimate) and in other
liability (+13.3% versus our 20.0%) and commercial auto (+13.1% versus our 20.0% estimate),
while reinsurance growth of 6.8% was below our 10.0% estimate as strong growth in property
reinsurance (+18.9% versus our -10%) was more than offset by weaker growth in casualty (0.7% as
compared to our 15.0% estimate) and monoline excess (0.6% growth as compared to our 10.0%
estimate). Earned premium growth of 17.3% just about in-line with our 17.4% estimate.
Net investment income above us. Net investment income of $202.8 million significantly beat our
$147.8 million estimate due to better results within the core portfolio, investment funds, and its
arbitrage trading account. Core portfolio income of $156.1 million was above our $140.6 million
estimate, while investment funds of $36.0 million was significantly above our $4.4 million, and
arbitrage trading accounts of $10.7 million beat our $2.9 million estimate. The investment yield on
the core portfolio was 3.0%, up from 2.57% in Q2, 2.14% in Q1, 2.04% in Q4, and 2.00% in the last
Q3.
· Other revenues above us. Revenues from non-insurance businesses was $119.0 million versus our
$110 million estimate, insurance service fees was $27.9 million, above our $24.0 million estimate,
and other income of $0.1 million slightly beat our $0.5 million estimate. Expenses from non-
insurance businesses of $116.2 million was higher than our $106.2 million estimate.
. Combined ratio missed on higher cats and adverse reserve development. The combined ratio of
92.1% missed our 90.1% estimate due to higher catastrophe losses and the adverse development
in the quarter. The insurance combined ratio was 91.2%, a miss versus our 88.6% estimate and the
reinsurance combined ratio of 98.6% beat our 101.1% estimate. The loss ratio was 64.1% versus
our 62.0% estimate, while the expense ratio of 28.0% just beat our 28.1% estimate, and it seems
like WRB could maintain an expense ratio close to the Q2 level. Catastrophe losses of $94.1 million
(3.9 points) were higher than our $83.0 million (3.4 point) estimate. Adverse development of $39.1
million was significantly worse than our $0.5 million estimate. WRB said that the strengthening
was associated with two Covid-19 claims and that they did not expect it to recur.
· Underlying results beat us on better expense ratio. The underlying combined ratio was 86.6% just
better than our 86.7% estimate, due to a slightly better expense ratio, while the underlying loss
ratio of 58.6% was in-line with our estimate. The insurance underlying combined ratio (assuming all
the adverse development hit the segment) of 87.0%, missed our 86.5% estimate due to a higher
loss ratio (59.0% versus our 58.5% estimate). The reinsurance underlying combined ratio came
in at 84.9%, beating our 88.0% estimate due to a better loss and expense ratio. The reinsurance
underlying loss ratio was 56.5%, better than our 59.0% estimate. In getting the segment underlying
combined ratio we attribute all the adverse development to the insurance segment (WRB said the
vast majority hit the insurance segment and does not give the exact numbers until the 10-Q/10-
K).
· Capital return below us, with a modest level of buyback. WRB bought back a modest 0.1 million
shares for $6.6 million, versus our 0.8 million shares for $50 million estimate, and no repurchases
over the past three quarters. Including dividends (regular and special), total capital return was
$26.8 million, or 9.5% of operating earnings of $281.8 million.

Estimates Mostly Unchanged. See Exhibit 5 below for an overview of our estimate changes following
Q3 2022 earnings. Following WRB's conference call, we are raising our 2022 EPS estimate to $4.40
from $4.19, while our 2023 and 2024 EPS estimates and unchanged at $5.05 and $6.05, respectively.
For our forward numbers lower underwriting income is being offset by higher investment income as
WRB reinvests its portfolio at higher yields. Currently, we model a core fixed income portfolio yield for
2023 and 2024 of 3.57% and 4.14%, respectively, vs. the fixed income yield in the quarter of 3.01%.

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB currently trades at 3.04x Q3 2022 book value, which compares to the 5-
year and 10-year average multiples of 1.99x and 1.69x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 2.35x
and 10-year minimum is 1.28x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 3.04x, which is where the shares are
currently trading, although we note that for the P&C sector price-to-book valuations are fuller given
the unrealized losses we have seen in this rising interest rate environment. For WRB, we exclude AOCI,
the shares are trading at just around 2.50x adjusted Q3 book. On a P/E basis, WRB is trading at 14.4x
our 2023 EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year average multiples of
18.8x and 16.9x, respectively. It is above the 5-year minimum, which was is 12.9x (during the low point
of the pandemic) and above the 10-year minimum of 10.4x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 25.0x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases
in 2022 which should translate into a good level of premium growth and underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is
currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $85.00 from NC
Our price target of $85 is based on a 2.9x multiple of our year-end 2023 book value estimate. Our price target also represents a ~17.0x
multiple against our 2023 EPS estimate. The 17x is a premium to the standard commercial players given that WRB is showing better
growth. Further, it is a discount to its peak historical multiples, further supporting the choice of multiple in our view.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe and/or Covid-19 losses.

W.R. Berkley Corporation
Equity Research
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
