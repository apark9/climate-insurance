Feb '23 Earnings: Unfavorable PYD
Mostly Stems from Personal Auto
Higher settlements, aging, and inflationary factors contributed
to adverse PYD. Despite CPI type of inflation being past its
trough, insurance severity trends are lingering longer. We pay
more attention to absolute inflation.
Unfavorable PYD: PGR reported 3.5 pts of unfavorable PYD, following 6.5 pts of unfavorable PYD
in January. The majority (70%) of the $145mn of unfavorable PYD was in the personal auto
segment related to property damage, collision, and comprehensive coverages given higher
settlements and changes to re-estimates including inflationary factors. We estimate that
adverse PYD contributed 3.1 pts to personal lines loss ratio. The balance of adverse PYD came
from commercial auto (25%) and property. These collective two-month actions are a negative
read on ALL (we model $140mn or 1.2 pts of adverse PYD on ALL's 1Q23 estimates).
The cost & sustainability of growth: Personal auto PIF grew +2.4% sequentially (Feb '23 vs.
Jan '22), stable compared to +2.4% sequentially (Jan '23 vs. Dec '22). On an annualized basis,
that would imply PIF growth of 29% (keeping monthly growth constant over 12 months), though
there are seasonality adjustments needed. We question the sustainability of growth, as PGR's
premiums to surplus is ~3x. On a y/y basis, PGR recognized positive personal auto PIF growth
over the last five months (+8.1% in Feb, +5.4% in Jan, +2.6% in Dec, +1.7% in Nov. and 0.5% in
Oct.). PGR's pricing may appear more competitive as the insurer believes taking rates is behind
it, a sentiment that we think is premature. PGR may be leaving rate on the table. PGR's overall
premium growth levels (+31% NPW y/y) consume capital, and it is generating lower organic
capital through earnings than its historical trend.
PGR's underlying loss ratio three-month simple average of 71.5% (70.6% Feb., 68.5% Jan., 75.4%
Dec.) has a way to go to return to pre-pandemic levels (~68%). More importantly, PGR is on the
trajectory to reach double-digit PIF growth by March or April. We would like to see a reversion to
its pre-pandemic underlying loss ratio of 68% on a sustainable basis with no PYD noise in order
to justify growth that is faster than marketplace conditions.
PGR's expense ratio was roughly stable at 20.6% in Feb vs. 20.2% in Jan and increased from
17.3% in Dec. To recap, PGR's pre-pandemic expense ratio ran just north of 20%. We note, PGR's
reported combined ratio in February was 95.1%, below the 96% target.
PGR's pre-tax net investment income (ex expenses) this month was $128mn vs. our $133mn
estimate. Lower equity market returns (-2.4% common stock yield) and fixed income returns (-

1.2%) weighed on NII in the quarter. As of February 28, 2023, PGR held a marginal $74mn of
fixed income securities and $1mn of common stock related to liquidated financial institutions.
February operating EPS of $0.41 slightly missed our $0.42 estimate, reflecting adverse PYD
tempered by higher premium growth than expectations. We also had modeled catastrophe loss
of $38mn vs. PGR's $17mn.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 152.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~21x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 90.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~13x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +8.1% in February (above our estimate of +7.0%),
as auto agency PIF (+3.0% vs. our +2.8%) and auto direct (+12.3% vs. our 10.4%). outperformed
our estimates. PGR is on the trajectory to produce double-digit PIF growth by March or April.

Underlying loss ratio - Improvements still needed to
justify if growth is rational
PGR's underlying loss ratio of 70.6% in Feb was worse than 68.5% in Jan. We think February is
somewhat more favorable on a seasonality standpoint, just not as favoable as January,
supporting a better underlying loss ratio than 75.4% in Dec. PGR's expense ratio was roughly
stable at 20.6% in Feb vs. 20.2% in Jan and increased from 17.3% in Dec. Collectively, PGR's
underlying combined ratio of 91.2% has deteriorated from 88.7% in Jan, 92.7% in Dec, and
93.7% in Nov.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
Our focus is on an absolute basis, where used car pricing remains significantly elevated (see
Figure 3). Likewise, if we compare used car & truck pricing to Jan '19 levels, it is up 31.0% vs. all
items at 19.5%. We pay lesser attention to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban

Consumers, which rose 6.0% over the 12 months from Feb 2022 to Feb 2023. Used car and truck
CPI trails all items at -13.6% in Feb vs. - 11.6% in Jan.
Manheim pricing was +4.1% m/m. We put less weight on Manheim pricing -7.3% y/y basis. More
importantly, if we compare Jan '22 to Jan '20, Manheim pricing is still up 49%. Compounded
auto pricing during that period has not caught up - not anywhere close. There is still significant
rate catch-up needed to see that inflection point. It will be like an "x"; loss costs go down, then
pricing goes up - where the two intersect in our view can take a bit longer, especially given how
long it is taking auto pricing to actually "earn" in.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within
the next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or
an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $125 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended ~11.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.7x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.

Valuation Methodology: Our $123 PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double-digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
