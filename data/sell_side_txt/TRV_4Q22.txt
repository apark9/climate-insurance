TRV: Strong BI Margin Overshadows Personal Lines Trouble; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
Travelers stock traded up due to the stronger Business Insurance (BI) margin, which was
a debated topic since the preannouncement last week. Personal auto results are bad,
whereas BI seems to have a tailwind on the commercial property side.
Estimate and price target changes: Our 2023 and 2024 EPS estimates are now $14.60
and $17.20 (from $15.35 and $17.95). We are also introducing a 2025 EPS estimate
of $18.90. Our estimates reflect weaker personal auto results, lower fixed NII, counter-
balanced by slightly better Business Insurance results. Our price target is now $181 (from
$180), reflective of higher group multiples.
Read thrus: (1) commercial results remain good, with momentum in commercial
property, (2) personal auto results are bad with loss trend the culprit (still double-digits),
(3) the investment income guide was modestly lower for FY 2023 with an average fixed
income NII of $535 million, down from $540 million, and (4) reinsurance rates went
up-TRV increased its retention by 17% ($3 billion to $3.5 billion) and while they did not
want to say how much their reinsurance costs went up, they did rise.
Positive BI discussion: Within BI, terms & conditions in property improved over the
course of the quarter, which will be a tailwind to profitability. Umbrella saw some
unfavorable development in the quarter, as loss costs were worse than expected, as more
losses reached excess layers given inflation. Within workers' comp, renewal rates got more
negative in the quarter despite RPC remaining in the mid-single digits and increasing Y/Y,
reflective of the strong profitability of the business.
Personal auto discussion not so good: the underlying combined ratio in auto of 110.5%,
included about one-point of current accident year adjustments and TRV did say that
the Q4 is typically about 6-7 points higher than the FY (FY 2022 was 103.9%). They also
noted bodily injury severity came in higher than their expectations in Q4. TRV expects to
get to rate adequacy in a majority of their states by mid-year 2023, although they did not
say what they are assuming for forward loss trend.
The stock from here: TRV traded up on the stronger Business Insurance results, which
was a concern since the preannouncement last week. However, the personal auto results
were extremely weak and show a good delta between where TRV is and their ultimate
margin target. Numbers should be lower following the quarter due to weaker personal
lines margins and modestly lower NII and we believe the stock could be range-bound at
least until we see how results transpire from the rest of the group.

Takeaways for the Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us, and the laterals for the rest of the group are below.
Net-net, the biggest takes are that TRV continues to see pretty poor personal auto results, seemed
positive about the commercial property market, and brought down their investment income guide
modestly in 2023. Highlights of the laterals that we see for the group follow below:
路 Commercial lines pricing could benefit from commercial property momentum. TRV said that its
renewal rates in BI were +4.5% in Q4 as compared to 5.1% in the third quarter, 4.9% in Q2, and on
par with the Q1. TRV did say that commercial property rates improved as they moved through the
quarter, while the decline in workers' compensation rates got greater in the quarter. The positive
commercial property color combined with TRV taking a quota share on the Fidelis book is a
positive for the commercial peers.
路 Personal lines continue to struggle. TRV printed a 110.5% personal auto underlying combined
ratio and even when we adjust for one point of current year adverse development, it still was a
pretty poor result. The company targets a mid-90s to perhaps a range above the upper-end of
the mid-90s and we believe the Q4 result shows how far they are from hitting the target. These
results highlight personal auto carriers are still struggling to get enough rate to offset the
elevated severity loss trends.
路 Exposure growth remains strong. Exposure growth remained at strong levels seeing an uptick
of 5.6% in Q4, up from 5.0% in Q3, 5.3% in Q2 and even more when compared to 4.1% in Q1,
which is a bullish sign for the insurance brokers. This appears to be a good sign for all insurance
brokers-given that TRV is more of a small-middle market insurer, it is the best take for AJG
and BRO, but does point to a good quarter for the group in general.
. After-tax fixed Income NII revised down modestly. The company modestly lowered its fixed
income investment income guidance by about $20 million over the course of 2023, which we
believe reflects interest rates dropping modestly since the last time they provided guidance. This
is a small movement, and we believe could perhaps point to modestly lower investment income
at other players, although we do not expect much to provide specific NII guidance (CB guides
one quarter ahead and HIG should provide some commentary on its investment income with its
2023 guidance).
路 Stronger-than-expected alternative investment quarter. From the preannouncement last week
we knew that TRV would see decent results from its alternative investment income. While they
saw about a 2.3% return, which is below normal levels, that is still a good result given the lag within
the PE portfolio. Further, ALL also saw better results than we had expected from its performance-
based investments. Given TRV results we expect other insurers could beat our alternative
investment income assumptions, as we had modeled for flat results in the quarter.

What the Companies Are Saying-TRV
Outlook. They did not quantify how much their reinsurance costs rose, but said it would not have a
meaningful impact on margins and the removal of aggregate XOL property treaty should be a modest
25bp headwind to the underlying combined ratio. The uptick in retention on their reinsurance ($3.5
billion from $3.0 billion) should not have a significant impact on the business as it is rising in parallel
with premiums. TRV also announced a 20% quota share with Fidelis to take advantage of the hard
market in property, which should increase their international BI NPW by $550-$600 million in 2023
and said even the worst-case underwriting scenario would lead to manageable losses for TRV. In
personal auto, they said bodily injury severity was higher than expected in the Q4 and that severity
trends remain in the double digits for both property and auto (with frequency reaching pre-pandemic
levels) with the auto underlying including about a point of current accident year reserve reestimates.
Their target range for auto remains near the range of mid-90s, but they did not provide a target date
on reaching those margins given the uncertainty around severity.
Pricing. In Business Insurance, TRV characterized the pricing environment as very strong and the
RPC at 10.1% is spot on with the eight-quarter average and has been very stable, with some small
movements between rate and exposure. For personal auto, they expect to be adequate from a written
basis by mid-year 2023, which is unchanged from last quarter. For personal lines, they expect the RPC
to continue to rise from these levels in both auto and home. TRV also said workers' comp RPC was in
the mid single digits, but loss trend were negative with the net of the two buckets skewing toward the
negative, but overall said they remain positive on the line and will be cautious with pricing.
Guidance. The exhibit below highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2023.
. Fixed income NII lowered for the back of 2023. TRV is now looking for fixed income and short-
term investments to average $535 million on an after-tax basis in 2023 (with range of $515 - 560
million); this is down from $540 million (with a range of $515 - $570 million with Q3 earnings).
. Personal lines frequency/pricing. TRV mentioned that frequency is at pre-pandemic levels and
also pointed to higher bodily injury severity and higher vehicle and repair costs as driving the
weaker personal auto results. They expect written pricing to reach adequate levels in a majority of
their states by the middle of 2023.
路 Expense ratio of about 28.5-29%. TRV is looking for an expense ratio in the range of 28.5-29% for
2023. The full-year 2022 expense ratio came in at 28.5%, relative to the guide of under 29%.
Investments. TRV modestly lowered their guidance for fixed income NII (post-tax) to $515 million in
Q1 to $560 million by Q4 (an average NII of $535 million per quarter), from their last guide of $515
million to $570 million. They did not provide a specific reason on the modest guide down, but it could
be related to the pullback in rates since the beginning of December (the 10-year is down 23 bps since
end of November). The non-fixed income portfolio saw an after-tax yield of 1.9%, which was down
from the 2.5% last quarter and well below the 15.2% yield in 2021, as markets have pulled back.
Liquidity and Capital. TRV has $1,452 million of capital at the holding company level with all of their
capital ratios at or better than target levels (debt to capital ratio is 21.6% in target range of 15-25%).
When asking about potentially changing capital return plans (i.e., dialing back repurchases), given the
higher retention on their reinsurance program (raised to $3.5 billion from $3.0 billion), they said it does
not have a significant impact on their view of capital adequacy. They did say they returned more capital
in 2022 given the strong capital position coming out of 2021, but they do not expect to continue to be
able to return nearly 100% in terms of operating earnings between buybacks and dividends.

Overview of our estimate changes. The exhibit below highlights the changes we made to our earnings
model following 4Q 2022 earnings.
路 2023 EPS goes down to $14.60 (from $15.35) to reflect worse underlying margins in personal
auto and modestly lower fixed investment income given the guide down to $560 million by Q4
(versus previously guided $570 million) and to account for the change in rates YTD, partially offset
by better BI margins.
路 2024 EPS goes to $17.20 (from $17.95) to reflect worse underlying margins in personal auto and
lower net investment income, partially offset by better BI margins.
. 2025 EPS is introduced at $18.90.

. In Q4, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +4.5%, decelerating from the +5.0% in the
prior quarter. Exposure growth was up 5.6%, which was an acceleration from the 5.0% in the prior
quarter, and shows exposure growth still has legs given inflation despite recessionary concerns. The

Pricing Highlights-Personal Lines
Personal Lines-TRV Continues to See Rate Acceleration, but Margins Show More Rate and Time
Needed
路 Within Personal Auto, TRV saw renewal premium change enter double digits (in line with their
guide last quarter to enter double digits) at 11.4%, which was an acceleration from the 8.2% last
quarter; however, their auto underlying margin was above 110%, which was the highest since
Q4 2016, which shows the need for additional rate and simply more time for these rate hikes to
earn into the P&L. On the auto side, they highlighted that margins continue to be impacted by
higher severity and frequency returning to pre-pandemic levels. Further, they said that they expect
written pricing will achieve rate adequacy in a majority of their states by mid-year 2023, although
they did not say what they are assuming for forward loss trend.
. Homeowners' RPC also accelerated sequentially, jumping to a record-high 14.5% Y/Y, up from the
13.9% last quarter. They expect the RPC in home to continue to improve from here.
. Auto new business growth declines Y/Y. Travelers' new business in auto decreased 3% Y/Y to $270
million, after increasing 20% Y/Y last quarter showing TRV may finally be pulling new business
away from states where they are not getting enough rate and introducing stricter underwriting
standards. This is also reflected in the PIF numbers, as auto PIFs declined 0.2% sequentially, which
was the first sequential decline since Q1 2019. Home new business was up 4% Y/Y to $284 million,
modestly down from the 5% Y/Y growth in the prior quarter. From a PIF standpoint, home saw a

The Travelers Companies, Inc.
Valuation
Current valuation. The TRV shares are now trading at 2.08x Q4 book value, which is a 10-year high
and well above its 5-year (1.44x) average, and its 10-year (1.38x) average multiple. The P/B multiple
has increased as reported book value has seen pressure from unrealized losses on TRV's investment
portfolio; when excluding unrealized losses (net), shares are currently trading at 1.60x Q4 adjusted
book of $120.67 (more in line with the 5- and 10-year averages). On a price-to-earnings basis, the
shares are trading at 13.2x our updated 2023 EPS estimate and 11.2x our 2024 EPS estimate versus
the 5-year average of 11.9x, 10-year average of 11.6x and the 5-year and 10-year peak of 13.9x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the hard commercial market as pricing should continue to have legs given inflation and
higher weather volatility. Although we are positive on the commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers
due to its smaller account exposure, higher workers' comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes, and personal
lines exposure, particularly auto, which is well above target margins of mid-90s. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation,
lower reserve releases, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral and rate its
shares Equal Weight as a result.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $181.00 from $180.00
Our price target of $181 is based on around a ~1.65x multiple of our projected 2024 book value estimate of around $109.47 and 10.5x
our 2024 EPS estimate of $17.20.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.

trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
