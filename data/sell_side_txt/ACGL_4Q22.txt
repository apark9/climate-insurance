Robust MI and Reinsurance Margins Drive 4Q Results
ACGL's results were robust, with upside in EPS and strong business trends. We
consider ACGL a premier franchise, but are Neutral on the stock due to valuation.
· Sizable EPS beat. Operating EPS of $2.14 was well above our $1.40 estimate
and consensus of $1.33. The upside to our model was driven partly by more
favorable PYD (+$0.30 variance) and lower cat losses (+$0.10 variance), but
EPS would have still exceeded forecasts, helped by robust investment income
and slightly better than assumed core margins (ex. cats and PYD). Premiums
benefited from a few non-recurring deals, which did not affect income.
· Business trends were strong overall. MI results were especially robust,
marked by weak written premiums (-5%, close to our assumption) but strong
margins (CR -27.1% vs. our 6.2% estimate and CR ex. cats and PYD 45.0% vs.
41.2%E). While pleased with results, we do not expect MI margins and
earnings to sustain at the 4Q22 level. P&C insurance results were better than
expected as well, with strong premium growth (+17%, slightly below our
+22% assumption) and upside in margins on both a reported and core basis (CR
92.1% vs. 92.6%E; CR ex. cats and PYD 89.6% vs. 91.3%E). Similarly, P&C
reinsurance margins were robust (CR 78.5% vs. 85.6%E; CR ex. cats and PYD
83.0% vs. 83.6%E). Reinsurance written premiums more than doubled on a
reported basis, but increased 61% ex. non-recurring specialty transactions,
considerably above our +13% assumption. Investment income benefited from
the rise in interest rates. As expected, ACGL did not repurchase stock in 4Q22.
. We project ACGL to report robust results in the near term, but our long-
term fundamental outlook is mixed. In our view, ACGL's results in the next
few quarters will be marked by robust margins and top-line growth in the re/
insurance business, strong margins in the MI division, and weak premium
growth in MI. Longer term, margins in the MI business should stay healthy, but
are likely to moderate considerably from recent levels, which have been
boosted by reserve releases. A weaker housing market and higher
unemployment pose risks to the MI business as well. Meanwhile, our long-
term outlook for the P&C reinsurance market is cautious. ACGL is one of the
best positioned carriers to benefit from the current hard market. However, we
remain skeptical of sustained hard pricing and expect structural issues such as
increased 3rd party participation, higher mobility of capital, and broker
consolidation to bring additional capacity to the market. Arch has flexibility to
supplement organic growth with repurchases, although we expect buybacks to
be modest in the next year, partly due to the higher stock price.
Morgan
· We affirm our Neutral rating. We view Arch as a top-tier insurance franchise,
but in relatively commoditized markets. Also, we feel that ACGL is among the
best positioned carriers to take advantage of hard reinsurance pricing. On the
other hand, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance market remains
downbeat. Furthermore, we feel that ACGL's valuation is not too enticing
considering the company's long-term ROE and growth profile.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We consider Arch a premier franchise and expect it to
generate higher and less volatile underwriting margins than
most peers. However, we remain Neutral on the stock given a
cautious long-term outlook for the P&C reinsurance market.
In our view, near-term results in the MI business will benefit
from reserve releases, while results in the P&C reinsurance
business will be boosted by hard pricing and tighter terms/
conditions. However, our long-term outlook for ACGL's
business is less upbeat. We expect MI returns to be held back
by the commoditized nature of the product, black box pricing,
and higher capital requirements. Moreover, we remain
negative on the P&C reinsurance business and expect greater
third-party participation, increased mobility of capital, and
consolidation among brokers to preclude a prolonged hard
market.

In our view, ACGL is a premier franchise that should benefit from near-term
tailwinds in the reinsurance market, but we remain Neutral on valuation. We
believe that ACGL has an industry-leading reinsurance business with a unique culture
and approach to underwriting that we expect to drive superior returns and less volatile
margins over time. In addition, Arch is a top competitor in the mortgage insurance (MI)
market, which we view as structurally superior to reinsurance. In primary P&C, ACGL
has gained share and expanded margins, helped by the favorable pricing environment.
We expect ACGL's near-term results to benefit from reserve releases in the MI book
and healthy re/insurance pricing. On the other hand, despite favorable conditions in the
reinsurance market currently, our long-term outlook for the business remains cautious
given structural headwinds such as low barriers to entry and limited pricing power.
Lastly, ACGL's valuation is not enticing following its recent outperformance.
P&C Reinsurance: N-T Tailwinds, L-T Outlook Downbeat
Hard reinsurance pricing and tighter terms/conditions bode well for ACGL's
results in the near term, but our long-term outlook for the market remains
cautious. Arch has historically generated better, and less volatile, margins than most
reinsurers, which we attribute to its focus on specialty reinsurance (where pricing tends
to be less competitive), conservative underwriting philosophy, ability to shift target
segments based on changing market conditions, and judicious management of cat risk.
In particular, ACGL prices business using the risk-free rate (leading to more
conservative underwriting) and uses a long-term compensation plan for underwriters
that pays based on underwriting margins over a multi-year period. Also, the creation of
3rd party capital vehicles such as Premia Re has allowed Arch to earn fee income from
its reinsurance franchise. We view Arch as a top-tier reinsurer and expect firmer
reinsurance pricing to boost results through 2023. However, our long-term outlook for
the reinsurance market remains cautious given its structural issues, including its
commoditized nature, the ease of entry of new capital, and a broader set of capital
providers (many, such as pension funds, that have lower return thresholds). As such, we
are skeptical of a prolonged hard market. We believe that any signs of additional
capacity entering the market would weigh on investor sentiment on reinsurance stocks,
which have become consensus longs in recent months.
Mortgage Insurance: Growth to be Poor, Margins Healthy
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance through acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and United
Guaranty in 2016) during a time when market conditions were favorable, marked by
appreciating home prices, relatively stringent lending standards at mortgage issuers, and
disciplined pricing by mortgage insurers. The company's MI business has generated
healthy margins since and, despite the temporary setback from COVID-related
delinquencies in 2020, results have been strong overall. In our opinion, near-term MI
results will benefit from reserve releases, particularly in 1H23, as more loans delinquent
at the onset of the pandemic become current. On the other hand, higher interest rates
will suppress mortgage origination volumes and although not imminent, a recession
would increase defaults and pressure margins in the business.

4Q22 Details
This evening, ACGL announced 4Q22 operating EPS of $2.14, well above our $1.40
assumption and consensus of $1.33. Compared with our model, underwriting income
was better across all divisions (mortgage insurance, reinsurance, insurance) and
investment income was significantly higher as well. The upside to our model was driven
partly by higher than assumed favorable PYD (+$0.30 variance per share) and lower cat
losses (+$0.10 variance), but earnings would have exceeded forecasts regardless, helped
by robust investment income and slightly better than assumed core underwriting
margins (ex. cats and PYD). While premiums benefited from a few non-recurring
transactions in the reinsurance business, these did not contribute materially to income.

Business trends were strong. MI results were especially robust, marked by weak
written premiums (-5%, close to our assumption) but strong margins (CR -27.1% vs. our
6.2% estimate and CR ex. cats and PYD 45.0% vs. 41.2%E). While pleased with results,
which benefited from considerably higher than assumed favorable development, we do
not expect MI margins and earnings to sustain at the 4Q22 level. P&C insurance results
were better than expected as well, with strong premium growth (+17%, slightly below
our +22% assumption) and upside in margins on both a reported and core basis (CR
92.1% vs. 92.6%E; CR ex. cats and PYD 89.6% vs. 91.3%E). Similarly, P&C
reinsurance margins were robust (CR 78.5% vs. 85.6%E; CR ex. cats and PYD 83.0%
vs. 83.6%E). Reinsurance written premiums more than doubled on a reported basis, but

Mortgage Insurance: Reserve Releases Boosted Earnings
We expect higher interest rates to suppress growth in the mortgage insurance (MI)
business, and margins to compress from recent levels but remain healthy overall.
The MI business reported underwriting income of $374 million, well above our $272
million estimate, driven by upside in margins (combined ratio of -27.1% versus our
6.2% estimate) and, to a lesser extent, higher than expected net earned premiums (-2.9%
vs. decline of 5.6%E). As in recent quarters, earnings were lifted by the release of
COVID-related reserves (-72.1% vs. - 35.0%E ; $211 million vs. $100 million in dollar
terms), which more than offset worse than assumed core margins (CR ex. cats and PYD
45.0% vs. 41.2%E). The lower core margin was driven by an uptick in the attritional
loss ratio (25.2% vs. 21.0%E), partly reflecting higher default rates in 4Q22, which
more than offset a lower expense ratio (19.8% vs. 20.2%E). Net written premiums
declined 5.1% to $275 million, close to our $273 million forecast.
In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were pressured by artificially high delinquencies
caused by homeowners availing of government forbearance programs. However, after
spiking initially in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has steadily declined,
benefiting MI margins. With the expiry of the programs, a significant portion of
previously delinquent loans has cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were taking
advantage of the mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial stress. At the same
time, the significant appreciation in house prices has provided a cushion to homeowners
under stress who are truly struggling to pay their mortgages, limiting losses for MI
carriers. The percent of loans in default in the U.S. primary MI business was 1.8% at
12/31/22, down from 2.4% at 12/31/21 but up from 1.7% at 9/30/22.

We expect MI margins to continue to benefit from reserve releases, but to a
significantly lesser extent than in 2022. Under U.S. GAAP accounting, Arch sets
reserves for its primary U.S. MI business based on reported delinquencies (unlike for
P&C lines, an IBNR component is not permitted under U.S. GAAP for primary MI
business). An increase in reported delinquencies at the onset of COVID led Arch and its

MI peers to establish corresponding reserves despite the healthy labor market and
appreciation in house prices. However, a meaningful portion of these delinquencies
arose from homeowners taking advantage of the government's forbearance protection
programs (mainly to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship. As such, most of
these delinquent loans have cured following the expiration of forbearance programs
(initially set for 12/31/20, but then extended through 9/30/21 and, in some cases, year-
end 2021 or beyond), resulting in the release of previously incurred reserves. The
interplay of cures on previously delinquent loans and how new delinquencies emerge in
response to the economic environment, which is beginning to soften, will be the key
driver of MI margins through 2023. Overall, we project MI margins to remain healthy
given strong labor and housing markets, cures on previously delinquent loans, and the
equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due to the appreciation in house prices. On
a cautious note, top-line growth in the business is likely to be weak as higher interest
rates reduce mortgage originations. Also, a weaker economy could deflate home prices
and lead to higher defaults on mortgages, particularly among borrowers that have
weaker credit profiles, although a material increase in losses seems unlikely in the near
term. Barring a recession, we expect core margins to stay healthy, but a declining
tailwind from reserve releases should suppress reported margins in the MI division even
if economic trends stay favorable.
ACGL has become a formidable competitor in the mortgage insurance market
through acquisitions and could expand further via M&A. ACGL entered the
mortgage re/insurance business in 2011 but was only marginally involved in the market
at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit unions and as a reinsurer
through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The company's 2014 acquisition of CMG
Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger foothold as it received a ratings
upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P) and gained distribution in the
bank channel. Following the deal, Arch became a top 10 competitor in the domestic
private MI market. Arch's market position strengthened further following its 2017
acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which catapulted it to a top-3 spot (as
part of the deal AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance blocks originated by UGC pre
2017). Arch has also expanded in foreign MI markets through M&A, including its
acquisition of Westpac's MI business in Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Lower Expense Ratio Drove Earnings Upside
The insurance business reported strong underwriting margins and healthy, but
lower than expected, net written premium growth. Underwriting income in 4Q22
was $98 million, higher than our $90 million estimate, driven by a better combined ratio
(CR 92.1% vs. 92.6%E). Net earned premium growth was higher than our forecast
(+24.0% vs. +21.7%E) while net written premium growth was lower (+17.4% vs.
+21.9%E, +18.6% in 3Q22, and +23.7% in 4Q21), which management partly attributed
to some moderation in price increases, particularly in casualty lines. The lower
combined ratio resulted from a favorable expense ratio (33.5% vs. 35.2%E), which more
than offset higher than expected catastrophe losses (2.8% vs. 1.5%E) and slight
unfavorability in the attritional loss ratio (56.2% vs. 56.1%E). Similar to the past few
quarters, the acquisition expense ratio rose from the prior year due to a business mix
shift to lines such as travel and professional liability, but this was mostly offset by a
lower operating expense ratio given the benefit of healthy premium growth.

In our view, ACGL has attractive opportunities in the primary P&C market, and
we expect premium growth and margins to remain healthy. After shrinking its
"cycle managed" business (now dubbed as wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to 2017,
ACGL is seeing healthy growth in this part of its primary P&C book, driven by price
increases in the broader market, particularly E&S. This, coupled with consistent
performance in the less opportunistic parts of its book (specialty small/middle market
and franchise), should drive healthy results in the business. On a cautious note, we
believe that the market is past the midpoint of the current hard pricing cycle, and that
exposure growth could decelerate if the economy slows. As such, although tailwinds in
the insurance business should persist as premiums are earned and certain lines of
business see harder pricing following Hurricane Ian (e.g. property coverage), we expect
overall price increases to moderate through 2023.
Reinsurance: Strong 4Q, N-T Outlook Incrementally Upbeat
Arch's reinsurance segment reported robust premium and healthy underwriting
results. The division generated underwriting income in 4Q22 of $263 million, well
above our $141 million estimate. Reported margins were better than assumed (CR of
78.4% vs. 85.6%E), primarily due to lower cat losses (none versus 5.0%E) and better
than expected prior year development (-4.5% vs. - 3.0%E). Margins were better than
assumed on a core basis as well (CR ex. cats and PYD of 82.9% vs. 83.6%E) due to a
lower expense ratio (25.5% vs. 28.5%E). We usually do not analyze reinsurance results
on ex. cats basis due to the concentration in catastrophe exposed business. Net written
premium growth was robust, up 117.6% to $1.8 billion, well above our 13.2%
expectation. Management noted that results in the quarter included non-recurring
transactions related to other specialty lines of business (property FAC and other non-cat
property). Excluding the impact of the transaction, net written premiums would have
grown 61.0% (roughly $400 million impact), the loss ratio would have been 5 points
lower, and the expense ratio would have been 2 point higher. On a normalized basis, we
estimate that the segment generated roughly $265 million of underwriting income
(combined ratio of roughly 75.5%). Management sounded upbeat on ACGL's position

We remain skeptical of a sustained hard reinsurance market, but ACGL is better
positioned than most peers to take advantage of favorable market conditions in the
near term. ACGL's reinsurance business was initially established to take advantage of
the hard market for casualty risk in the early 2000s. Over the years, however,
management has shifted Arch Re's business mix away from casualty coverage towards
other specialty lines such as surety, accident and health, agriculture, and trade credit,
which are generally less competitive and have more attractive risk-reward. Firm pricing
has benefited results in recent years and should drive continued strong premiums and
margins in the near term, especially following Hurricane Ian. Still, we expect the pace of
price hikes to moderate longer term and remain skeptical of a sustained hard reinsurance
market given the expected entry of additional capacity. Factors that contributed to a
multi-year soft market prior to 2018 (glut of capital, greater fluidity/speed of capital,
more providers of capacity, broker consolidation) are still prevalent, and should
preclude a prolonged hard reinsurance market. On a positive note, ACGL's reinsurance
results could benefit from the release of COVID-related reserves, a significant
proportion of which remain in IBNR. Similarly, we believe that loss reserves which
were set up for Ian could ultimately prove to be too conservative (most primary
companies booked lower Ian-related losses than reinsurers).

Maintaining EPS Estimates
We are maintaining our 1Q23 and 2023 EPS estimates at $1.51 and $5.31,
respectively. Our 2024 estimate of $5.63 is unchanged as well. Although we do not
expect the MI reserve release in 4Q22 to recur to the same extent in future periods,
thereby implying lower MI earnings in 2023, we project ACGL's higher run-rate net
investment income to be an offset. We plan to re-assess our model after the company's
earnings call tomorrow. In our opinion, cat losses (which would affect reinsurance and
insurance margins) and housing market trends (which affect MI margins and premium
growth) are the key sources of potential variance in reported results and our projections.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $58.00)
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premiere franchise and are incrementally positive on near-term
trends in the reinsurance market, but we remain Neutral on the stock. In our opinion,
ACGL has an industry-leading reinsurance business that will generate superior and less
volatile underwriting margins over time due to its unique culture and approach to the market.
In addition, Arch has established itself as one of the top competitors in the mortgage
insurance (MI) market, which we consider structurally better than P&C reinsurance. In
insurance, ACGL has been able to grow premiums and improve margins, helped by the firm
pricing market. We expect near-term results in MI to benefit from reserve releases.
Furthermore, hard pricing should boost premium growth and margins in the reinsurance
segment. Still, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance business remains cautious due to
structural issues facing the market, including low barriers to entry, increased participation
by third-party capital, and limited pricing power. Moreover, we believe that valuation is not
too compelling given the company's long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.
Valuation
We maintaining our December 2023 price target of $58. Our price target assumes a 1.3x
multiple on our 12/31/23E BV ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.4x multiple on our 12/31/23E BV
forecast, and an 11.0x multiple on our 2024 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach
with a sum-of-the-parts analysis that values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from
mortgage insurance. Our target multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix, which
has become more skewed to mortgage insurance. ACGL trades at 1.9x BV and 12.3x 2023E
EPS compared to 1.7x and 9.4x for the reinsurance sector, 1.0x and 7.2x for MI peers, and
2.0x and 13.0x for the broader P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for an extended period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. In
our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
· Management remains proactive with share repurchases. ACGL has repurchased
more stock than expected in 2H21 and 1H22, partly to take advantage of its depressed
trading multiples. A continuation of the trend could drive upward revisions in EPS
forecasts as well as boost sentiment on the stock.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
· ACGL and/or peers raise capital to take advantage of the hard reinsurance

market. This, in turn, could result in a reversal in pricing trends and potentially drive
reduction in EPS estimates as well as hurt sentiment on the sector.
· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development has
been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in the pace
of development could pressure margins and returns.
· Cat losses stay elevated. While prices for cat re/insurance have hardened, the frequency
and severity of losses have increased by a larger magnitude over time. This implies that
reinsurance prices need to rise significantly for carriers to earn adequate returns,
especially if cat losses are close to those in recent years.

stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable,
the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)

market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying
analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
