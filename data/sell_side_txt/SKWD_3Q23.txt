3Q23 Review: Opportunistic Fixed
Income Fund Winding Down
~32% GPW growth is a standout. SKWD rescinded its
commercial auto whole account QS that incepted at 1/1,
reversing 2 quarters of ceded premiums. We understand this
cession did not have any reinsurance recovery that needed to
be reversed. We also view rescinding a reinsurance treaty as
atypical.

Rates vs. Loss trends: Pure rates remain in double digits and are above loss cost inflation.
Last quarter SKWD talked about not changing its loss picks even if pricing exceeded loss trends,
which may explain the flat q/q AYLR performance (60.7%.)
Opportunistic Fixed Income Fund Winding Down - Leading to Higher Quality Asset Mix - Yet
a Lower Yield: 68% redemption effective Dec 31, 2023. (Opportunistic fixed income had $169mn
FMV as of June 30, 2023.) SKWD will reinvest in core fixed income securities, new money yield is
5.5% and the yield of those redeemed assets is higher at 7%. SKWD will retain the remaining
32% remaining portfolio, mostly commercial mortgage - industrial not office.
Strong GWP growth, though others are shrinking professional lines:
SKWD GWP grew by 31.6% y/y (vs. our 27.1% estimate) with double digit growth amongst every
underwriting division. In particular, Transactional E&S, Surety, Professional Lines, Captives and
Industry Solutions were each up over 20%. We understand that SKWD doesn't write public D&O,
still, we have seen general contraction in professional lines by other insurers. Transaction E&S
business premiums that SKWD charges is higher than KNSL with less exclusions.

Net premium retention. While retention is typically higher in 2H vs 1H, we found SKWD's 79%
retention in 3Q23 to be higher than usual. Essentially, SKWD rescinded its commercial auto
whole account QS that incepted at 1/1, reversing 2 quarters of ceded premiums, amounting to
$13.1mn. The industry has seen pressures on the commercial auto side, we would have
preferred more reinsurance protection for SKWD. We understand that SKWD's loss ratio runs at
mid to high 60s for commercial auto, higher than its all in loss ratio. Likewise, the industry has
taken reserve charges for commercial auto. We do not expect SKWD to rescind future
reinsurance treaties, we view this action as a one-off, and not a sign that SKWD is leaning into
commercial auto.

Expense ratio sub 30% guidance. The components of SKWD's expense ratio looks different this
quarter, where your acquisition ratio and operating ratio were pretty close at 15.0% and 15.1%,
respectively, usually operating expense ratio is a bit higher (17.3% in 2Q23) and acquisition ratio

is lower (at 11.9% in 2Q23.) Going forward, management expects a similar split as what we saw
in 3Q23. To recap, its 3Q23 policy acquisition ratio increase q/q was driven by the change in
business mix and the impact of canceling the quota share reinsurance contract. Its operating
expense ratio benefited from higher premium leverage.
Lighter catastrophe experience despite more property writings. 1Q catastrophe losses was
minimal at ~$1mn. SKWD is not exposed to severe convective storms and manages its
aggregations exposure tightly relative to its book.
Valuation. We reiterate our Overweight rating and $31 PT (from $29) which is based on a 50/50
weighted 12.5x (unchanged) P/E multiple on our '24 EPS estimate of $2.56 (from
$2.39) and 1.85x (unchanged) P/TBV excluding AOCI on our '24 TBVPS excluding AOCI of
$15.84 (from $15.48).

Why OVERWEIGHT?
E&S writers trade at a premium to
admitted writers. SKWD's multiple
could increase over time as the E&S
becomes a larger piece of their
overall mix from its current ~50%,
achievable within transactional E&S
and property. SKWD's stock
performance could hinge more on
execution than peers given a
shorter operating history under the
current management team.
Upside case
USD 32.00
Over time, multiple expansion could
come from the shift of business mix
towards the E&S market and we
expect underwriting profitability to
improve in 2023/2024. Our upside
case is based on a ~13x P/E '24 and
2.0x TBVPS for common
shareholders ex AOCI '24.
Downside case
USD 24.00
A slowdown in the E&S market and
unforeseen reserving issues from
their LPT transaction could lead to
sentiment risk compared to peers.
Our downside case is based on a
~9x P/E '24 and 1.5x TBVPS for
common shareholders ex AOCI '24.

3Q23 Highlights
Operating earnings beat: SKWD reported 3Q23 adjusted net operating earnings of $25mn or
$0.65 per share, which was better than our estimate of $15.6mn or $0.40 per share. The Street
was at $0.36 per share. The earnings beat was due to stronger premium growth, higher net
investment income, and better cat losses than our estimates. However, AYLR was slightly worse
than our estimates (by 20bps.)
3Q23 GWP growth: SKWD GWP grew by 31.6% y/y (vs. our 27.1% estimate). Double-
digit premium increases were broad based, seen across all eight of SKWD's underwriting
divisions.
Higher Net Retention: NWP grew 63.7% y/y; however, SKWD rescinded a quota share
reinsurance contract, whole account commercial auto, which increased premiums by $13.1mn.
Underwriting performance: SKWD's combined ratio was 90.2% vs. our estimate of 94.0%, a 9.6
pt y/y improvement amid lower catastrophes. Expense ratio in 3Q23 of 29.2% was worse
than our estimate of 28.8%. Accident Year Loss Ratio (AYLR), ex cats, was 60.7%, 130 bp y/y
improvement and worse than our estimate of 60.5%. Total company Accident Year Combined
Ratio (AYCR), ex cats, was 89.9% vs. our 89.3% estimate and improved 115bps y/y. 3Q
catastrophe losses of 0.4pts were better than our modeled 4.7pts.
Net Investment Income (NII): SKWD reported $13.1mn of net investment income vs. our
estimate of $10.3mn. The positive $8.5mn contribution from core fixed income outweighed the
minimal drag from opportunistic fixed income. Higher book yield of 4.2% at September 30, 2023
up from 3.3% at September 30, 2022. Likewise, SKWD benefited from a higher asset base.
Operating ROE (annualized) of 18.9% was better than our estimated 11.8%.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Greater variability of net investment income
stemming from its "opportunistic fixed income fund" (i.e. 19% of its investment portfolio and 60% of NII for YTD3Q22). This fund is originated and
managed by Arena, another Westaim subsidiary. Albeit, SKWD is winding down the opportunistic fixed income fund. Higher dependence on
reinsurance than established peers. SKWD is not immune to the secular challenges posed by the commercial auto insurance market (25% DPW for

YTD3Q22). SKWD was able to achieve sub 30% GWP growth in its core businesses over the last 2 years, with a notable step down in growth to sub 10%
level anticipated in 2023E. As the bulk of IPO proceeds are pushed down to the operating companies it remains to be seen if these proceeds are truly
funding future growth or back filling historical growth that had already consumed statutory capitalization.

Middle East: Nothing herein should be considered investment advice as defined in the Israeli Regulation of Investment Advisory, Investment Marketing
and Portfolio Management Law, 1995 ("Advisory Law"). This document is being made to eligible clients (as defined under the Advisory Law) only.
Barclays Israeli branch previously held an investment marketing license with the Israel Securities Authority but it cancelled such license on 30/11/2014
as it solely provides its services to eligible clients pursuant to available exemptions under the Advisory Law, therefore a license with the Israel
Securities Authority is not required. Accordingly, Barclays does not maintain an insurance coverage pursuant to the Advisory Law.

information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
