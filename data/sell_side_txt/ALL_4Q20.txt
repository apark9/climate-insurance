ALL 4Q: Looking Beyond Frequency
Stock Rating
OVERWEIGHT
Unchanged
Frequency tailwind persists in 4Q but the impact is moderating as seen in Allstate
brand auto underlying CR of 84.7% slightly up from 84.2% in 3Q and 82.6% in 2Q.
Adding to the strong underwriting story, ALL benefited from higher performance-based
NII tied to the equity markets. Looking forward, we are constructive that ALL is making
strategic strides to build its business model for the future which will be less capital
intensive with eyes on growth.

Unchanged
We anticipate ALL will optimize NatGen's reciprocal exchange structure for capital
efficiency. We would be as bold to say third party capital raising can be an option,
based on our conversation with Mario Rizzo, CFO. We also think ALL was
conservative in its ROE expansion narrative with respect to the ALIC sale as it did not
include in its equation $2.2bn of deployable capital.
ALL is a bit late to the rate reduction party but should have all the fun: In January,
ALL began to selectively file state rate reductions lagging the industry's 2020 efforts
(Figure 1). We attribute ALL's transformational growth plan as a supportive factor in
enabling ALL to be more price competitive by passing on savings to customers. To
some extent, ALL may be reacting to the -1.5% y/y decline in Prop-Liab NPW; while
retention dropped the larger culprit for premiums declines was auto premium refunds.

52 Week range
Multiline penalty box unwarranted given upcoming ALIC sale: We are maintaining
our price target of $125 on ALL reflecting a 50/50 weighting of 11x P/E multiple on our
2022 EPS estimate of $12.78 (down from $13.14) and 1.25x P/BV on our 2022 BVPS of
$87.3 (up from $80.7). As we noted in ALIC Sale Should Improve ROE Profile, 27/01/21,
we view ALL's prospective ROE as promising and expect the sale of ALIC to bring about
greater focus on its P&C business. ALL currently trades in the multiline penalty box at
8.4x P/E multiple (Barclays' forward '22), which is low relative to peers (10.2x to 15.5x
'22 P/E range) (Figure 3), and given shift in focus to P&C, we believe a higher multiple is
warranted.

USD 107.13
Price Target
USD 125.00
Why Overweight? Allstate is revolutionizing its op.
structure with its push into the independent agency
channel - a move we think will be positive despite
defying orthodoxies within its coveted captive agency
force. PIF growth should be driven by the company's
ability to pass along expense savings from its
transformational plan. Capital allocation remains a
strength.
Upside case
USD 135.00
Successful execution of Allstate's transformational
growth plans via short term efficiency gains and
longer term growth through developing omni channel
model drives a compelling upside case. Our upside
case of $135 assumes 10.6x our '22 EPS estimates.
Downside case
USD 95.00
Integration and execution risk of the National General
acquisition since it is a bold move to defy
longstanding 'channel conflict' orthodoxies within its
captive agency force. Miles driven growth pressures
ALL's margins. Our downside case of $95 assumes
7.4x our '22 EPS estimates.

A few thoughts ...
Personal auto margins have peaked in 2020 as frequency benefits from the COVID-19
pandemic are unlikely to return to April/May highs. However, ALL's strategic efforts
aimed at expense reduction and its strength in capital deployment provide critical offsets
which we believe will enable ALL to drive strong ROEs and a higher valuation in our view.
ALL is targeting a long term ROE range of 14% to 17% while growing market share in
personal lines; not mutually exclusive. We are modelling the higher end of that range as
ALIC was a drag on ROE.
4Q Indicators: Transformational growth plan in the works. ALL curtailed new agent
appointments as a means to construct a higher growth and lower cost business model.
ALL's new IE platform National General will look more like ALL by going upmarket with
products with a greater return profile. ALL is bullish on its homeowners book which we
think should help propel higher quality PIF growth on a bundling basis to the auto side. A
pandemic has also raised greater demand on ALL's telematics side.
Looking for Expense Savings Driven PIF Growth
We expect ALL to be able to leverage its ability to pass along expense savings from its
transformative growth plan in order to drive future PIF growth. While the execution of ALL's
plan is being put into motion as evidenced by its more recent move to file more rate
declines relative to the industry (Figure 1), we're closely watching ALL's y/y PIF growth
(Figure 2) to evaluate the relative success of its strategic plan. We are constructive on ALL's
homeowners business as an enabling product.

Exploiting NatGen's reciprocal exchange structure
Reciprocals are capital light and can boost margins. We think ALL will maintain National
General's attorney-in-fact for Adirondack Underwriters Reciprocal Exchange, providing
management services including underwriting, policy issuance, and claims administration.
Typically, the management fees that the reciprocal exchange pays to the attorney in fact are
based on gross premiums with an embedded profit margin. Under this arrangement,
National General still earns fees even during periods of underwriting losses including
catastrophe losses. Based on our conversation with Mario Rizzo, CFO, ALL is considering
further exploiting this reciprocal model and can even consider bolting on third party capital.
What will happen to ALL's Remaining Performance Based Assets? Stay Put
ALL holds an above market allocation of "performance based" assets, which is primarily
limited partnership investments. The annualized 5-year GAAP total return of this book was
8.8%, which is noticeably higher than its market-based portfolio with a 5.5% return over the
same period. This asset class is less liquid and better matches longer-term liabilities.
Following the ALIC sale, we think performance based assets remaining will carry lesser
emphasis since the P&C business does not follow the same liability driven investing
approach as the annuity business. It is not surprising that ALL will be retaining a portion of
their performance based assets following the ALIC sale since liability consolidators tend to
seek closed blocks that with lower yielding assets that they can better optimize; ALL's
performance based asset focus replicates what an alternative asset manager would already
do. ALL expressed appetite to maintain in its ongoing operations the balance of
performance based assets that are not all contained in ALL's annuity business. In fact,
$5.3bn of $8.75bn of these assets (based on the allocation as of Sept. 30, 2020 but using
total performance based assets as of Dec. 31, 2020) sit in ALL's P&C business. Our original
thinking was that ALL would have wanted to divest these assets as a focused P/C insurer
with shorter liabilities. However, it is our understanding after speaking with Mario Rizzo,
CFO that lower required capital for P/C insurance business still supports higher risk taking
on the asset side.
Capital Management
ALL returned $1.7bn to shareholders in 2020 via share repurchases. We anticipated
$312mn of buybacks in 4Q, but ALL repurchased $0mn. $1.5bn remains on the repurchase
authorization expected to be completed by the end of 2021, which we assume is distributed
evenly at $375mn per quarter. In addition, we assume ALL deploys the $2.2bn of capital
identified as part of the ALIC sale for repurchases from 3Q21-2Q22.
Room for ALL's P/E to Expand
We view ALL's prospective ROE as promising and expect the sale of ALIC to bring about
greater focus on its P&C business. ALL currently trades in the multiline penalty box at 8.5x
P/E multiple (Barclays' forward '22), which is low relative to peers (10.2x to 15.5x '22 P/E
range) (Figure 3), and given shift in focus to P&C, a higher multiple is warranted.
Most of ALL's direct peers are mutual companies. Therefore, we view its P&C personal lines
peer group as imperfect given ALL's market cap and breadth of product offerings. Even so,
we view PGR, KMPR, MCY and HMN as reasonable comps for ALL (Figure 3). We also
include balanced P&C companies with personal lines and commercial lines operations as
comps such as TRV, HIG, CINF, THG and STFC (Figure 4), although we view these as less
relevant because of their focus on commercial lines which is benefitting from a 'hard'
market cycle.

Model Changes
We are now modelling the use of the remaining $1.5bn of repurchase authorization evenly
distributed across quarters in 2021. We have also moved Allstate Life and Allstate Annuities
segment business to discontinued operations given the ALIC sale (ALIC Sale Should Improve
ROE Profile, 27/01/21) beginning in 1Q20, so the income is no longer included in ALL's
core adjusted net income for 2021 and 2022 but we do account for it in net income
applicable to common shareholders.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

Progressive Corp. (PGR)
Chubb Limited (CB)

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage
services, if applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
N: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank
PLC and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our Overweight rating and $125 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average P/E of 11.0x our '22 EPS estimate
of $12.78 and 1.25x YE22 estimated book value per share of $87.3.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Allstate's continuing growth in miles driven
could lead to increased auto accident frequency, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will
likely pressure net investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners
insurance business. Despite the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk
in combining business units under one operational model.
