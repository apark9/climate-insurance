AIG, Inc.
1Q22 Earnings Review: Dynamic
Underwriting Posture
Approaching underwriting dynamically makes sequential
comparisons less meaningful. AIG's AYLR and expense ratio can
bounce around by quarter, but FY combined ratio matters more.
AIG has shown strong GI underwriting acumen; its financial
acumen is starting to catch up. Corporate expenses are a drag
to ROCE, to be remediated.

AIG's goal is not necessarily to beat its targeted sub-90% combined ratio by exit 2022 - a
milestone it already reached a year early. Rather, AIG is aiming to achieve an attractive risk-
adjusted return while growing via higher client retention and new business. Since AIG is already
ahead of its sub-90% combined ratio, it can absorb some moderation of pricing and other rising
loss trends like inflation.
While AIG is well past its remediation stage, we think the company has maintained a dynamic
underwriting posture. AIG opportunistically shifts business mix and is willing to cut limits (i.e.
AIG Re gross property down by $500mn) and make tweaks to its reinsurance program, even
during the interim period between renewals. We wouldn't rule out the possibility of AIG
introducing another iteration to its reinsurance program once again in 2022, depending on its
catastrophe experience and pricing. We say that since AIG has already reduced its worldwide
aggregate prop cat limit to $1.1bn ('22 program) from $2.05bn ('21 program). Along the way, we
expect an interplay between the expense ratio and loss ratio to sometimes work in opposing
directions. For instance, consequential to AIG's 1/1 reinsurance renewals, its expense ratio was a
headwind in 1Q22 and is expected to be a tailwind in 2Q22. These quarterly nuances make
sequential trends less meaningful.

L&R separation incremental learnings, according to the company: 1) AIG's dividend target is
$600mn, while previously a $400mn-$600mn range was cited. CRBG's distributable earnings is
60-65% of AATOI ($2.3bn on a PF 2021 basis). 2) AIG stated that $300mn out of $1bn of parent
expenses (that reside in Other operations) will move to Corebridge upon deconsolidation.

Path to 10% ROCE: A timeline was not shared; all we know is that this target will be achieved at
some point post-deconsolidation of CRBG. Variables include the size and timing of the CRBG
IPO, and additional capital management and expense-cutting actions. In our view, valuation of
CRBG matters too, as AIG intends to use CRBG's proceeds to buy back stock .

What upsizing buyback authorization tells us ($5bn augments $1.5bn to remain on May 20,
2022): 1) AIG feels confident in its execution of its $7.6bn debt tendering to be completed by May
10 and its hold co. cash of $9.1bn at March 31, 2022 that it does not have to wait until after the
CRBG IPO to upsize its program. 2) To a lesser extent, part of its buyback authorization may be
in anticipation of its IPO proceeds raise.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
We view AIG as a wait-and-see
proposition as it goes down the
complex path of separating L&R as
well as ongoing initiatives to achieve
underwriting margin objectives.
Upside case
USD 70.00
Eventual successful expense
rationalization and separation of L&R
that yields a fair market value resulting
in a rerating of AIG RemainCo. Our
upside case assumes ~11x our '23 EPS
estimate.
Downside case
USD 54.00
Adverse reserve development
accompanying expansion of
underwriting risk appetite too fast too
soon. Our downside case assumes
~8.7x our '23 EPS estimate.

Prior-Year Reserve Development
Favorable PYD of $93mn. While AIG's reserve releases mainly came from older accident years,
BRK keeps that under the ADC, not a benefit for AIG. These older releases reflected WC and
short tail lines in North America and in Japan personal lines. We saw $91mn of reserve releases
came from AY21 and understand it reflects short tail lines. Included in AIG's $93mn of reserve
releases is $42mn of ADC amortization.
1Q Highlights
AIG is ahead of its underlying combined ratio <90% target by exit '22, the fourth consecutive
quarter with global commercial accident year combined ratio, ex cats (AYCR) <90%. Underlying
combined ratio of 89.5% vs. our estimated 89.7%. Accident year loss ratio, ex cats (AYLR)
improved 1.7 pts q/q and y/y while the expense ratio rose sequentially to 32% in 1Q22 vs. 30.6%
in 4Q21. Most of the underwriting improvements were seen in NA commercial as its AYLR
improved to 62.6% in 1Q22 from 66.3% in 4Q21 and 67.36% in 1Q21. NPW growth slowed at 2%

y/y, mostly seen in international personal lines, despite $1bn of new business written in the
quarter. BX partnership boosted fixed annuity sales, contributing to 150% y/y growth.
2% y/y NPW Growth Slowdown, Key Drivers: 1) AIG Re flat premiums. 1Q is a significant quarter
for AIG Re with over half of its premiums written on 1/1. AIG Re premiums represent 40% of NA
commercial lines. AIG Re was not seeing acceptable risk-adjusted returns, especially in prop cat.
As such, AIG Re cut its limits by $500mn. We do not have context of the starting point. 2)
Consolidation of retrocessional purchases for AIG Re and core property catastrophe reinsurance
for primary business at 1/1 that was sprinkled throughout last year.
L&R: Adjusted pre-tax income decreased 23% y/y, driven by: 1) lower call and tender income; 2)
continued elevated COVID-19 mortality, still within its sensitivity analysis; 3) lower NII from the
sale of its affordable housing portfolio in 4Q21; 4) reduced fee income; and 5) higher DAC .
Key Results
EPS Beat: AIG's 1Q22 Operating EPS of $1.30 was above our $1.18 estimate and $1.20 consensus
Street estimate. The beat primarily reflects better-than-expected NII, higher GI underwriting
gains, mostly on the underlying LR side, offset by a higher expense ratio and effective tax rate.
Significant variances: Better than expected pre-tax alternative returns of $528mn contributed
~$0.46 to EPS, offset by worse than expected FV change on fixed maturity securities of
$(151)mn, ~$(0.14) from EPS. We did not model above-trend VII. Above-trend VII was similar
between GI of $188mn and L&R of $190mn pre-tax. We are assuming the balance, $150mn,
resides in Other. AIG doesn't call out its COVID losses (just its sensitivity analysis); we were
modeling $82mn of losses (after-tax) or $(0.10) EPS impact.
NPW Growth y/y Standouts:
· Property up 48%
· A&H up 18%
· Personal Lines down 32%
Cat losses as expected: $274mn vs. our $279mn estimate. Russia/Ukraine-related losses of
$85mn. Largest cat event for AIG was Australian floods.
BVPS (common) fell to $69.30 in 1Q22 from $79.97 in 4Q21, by 13%. Adjusted AOCI ex Fortitude
Re funds withheld decline to $(5.9bn) as of March 31, 2022 from +$3.9bn as of YE21, a $9.8bn
reduction. AIG reinstated that it holds assets to maturity, therefore the unrealized loss will not
materialize.
Yield Enhancements from Rising Interest Rates
Asset duration: GI 4.0 years and L&R 8.4 years. We are assuming annual asset portfolio turnover
rates of 12.5% and 6%, respectively. Moving forward, new money yield is ~60 bps higher than
the current GI portfolio and 90 bps higher in L&R. Furthermore, for every 100 bps parallel shift in
the yield curve (we assume normal steep shape), NII increases by $500mn ($200mn in GI and
$300mn in L&R).
Capital Management
Cadence of $6.5bn board-authorized buyback program: AIG indicated that it will repurchase
at minimum $1.0bn of shares in 2Q22. To recap, as of March 31, 2022 there was $2.5bn
remaining under its former buyback program. AIG mentioned that it anticipates that $1.5bn
remains upon expiration of the Current 10b5-1 Plan as of May 20, 2022. The difference of $2.5bn
6 May 2022
5
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
at March 31, 2022 and $1.5bn at May 20, 2022 is $1bn. Another month of buybacks could in
theory transpire. We are modeling its authorization exhausting at YE23. Of course, CRBG IPO
proceeds could be another iteration to its program in our view.
AIG Inc. Debt Tendering/CRBG Debt Raising
AIG Inc.'s financial leverage of 27.8% is above its 20-25% target, due to negative marks on its
investment portfolio. Note, AIG Inc. includes AOCI in the denominator, Corebridge excludes it.
As such, financial leverage at the AIG Inc. level can elevate further given rising interest rates and
AOCI gets more squeezed. We are monitoring whether higher leverage would serve as an
impediment to AIG Inc.'s buyback program.
CRBG raised $6.5bn senior debt with a 3.91% weighted average coupon rate. According to the S-
1, the company's PF debt is $9.4bn including $3bn of hybrids. CRBG's senior debt issue was
oversubscribed, ahead of its original $6.0bn target.
$7.6bn total expected AIG parent debt reduction ($6.8bn done and EUR750 pegged for May
10) funded by $6.4bn promissory note proceeds from CRBG, and the remainder we assume was
parent company liquidity as a short-term measure - until CRBG completes its debt raise and
repays the $1.9bn remaining under its promissory note. As such, on a PF basis AIG's $9.1bn of
debt as of March 31, 2022 would temporarily decline to $7.2bn.
AIG reduced its annual interest expense by $290mn (3.82% average debt). We view AIG Inc.'s
interest expense save as a wash until it fully separates from CRBG. In the meantime it will
recognize CRBG's interest expense, ex NCI. The weighted average coupon rates for AIG's debt
reduction and CRBG's debt raise was not too dissimilar.
Valuation
Our prior methodology: $63 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of 10.5x (down
from 11x) our 2023 EPS estimate of $6.22 (from $5.82) and 0.7x (down from 0.8x) our 2023 book
value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate of $87.57 (up from $82.67). Our target multiples for AIG are
below the P/C insurance group given we expect lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.
Model Updates
. We raise our '22 buyback assumptions to $4.9bn for '22E from $3.9bn and $4bn for '23E from
$2bn.
· Further underlying margin expansion, we trimmed AYCR ex cat by 40 bps per our '22
estimate and AYCR ex cat by 30 bps per our '23 estimate.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

*This is the closing price referenced in the publication, which may not be
the last available closing price at the time of publication.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
A: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has been lead manager or co-lead manager of a publicly disclosed offer of securities of AIG, Inc. in the previous
12 months.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
D: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. in the past 12 months.

next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by AIG, Inc. and/or in any related derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from AIG, Inc. within the past 12 months.
L: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
N: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an

Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $63 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 10.5x our 2023 EPS estimate of $6.36
and 0.7x our 2023 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate of $87.57. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given we expect
lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a separation.
Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to walk away from
business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings or capital but
undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post separation may temper
AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.
