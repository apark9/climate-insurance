Earnings Revised - October 18, 2023
Commercial Lines Insurance
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
TRV: Lots to Dissect; Conference Call Round-Up
Our Call
TRV shares were unchanged as big picture takes were mixed - they pointed to still pushing
for price in BI, auto rate slowing (more states are rate adequate), and did not provide
much color on loss ratio or reserve movements as they have in the past.
The stock from here: We think how Travelers trades depends on the results we get from
other commercial lines insurers. We were cautious on TRV into the print because we
thought the RRC could slow sequentially (it didn't), they could take another reserve charge
in their ongoing commercial lines (they added to commercial auto but did not quantify the
amount), and the underlying loss ratio could disappoint (it did but was attributed to Y/Y
movements that offset earned rate over loss trend).
Estimate and price target changes: Our 2023 EPS estimate goes to $10.85 (from
$12.65), 2024 EPS goes to $18.55 (from $18.60) and our 2025 EPS goes to $21.10
(from $21.35) to reflect the Q3 shortfall, the expected Q4 seasonality in auto,
adjustments to our investment income estimates, counter-balanced by changes to our
BI margins (underlying as well as reserve development). Our price target is unchanged at
$172. See inside for highlights of key issues for TRV.
Read thrus: (1) still bullish on commercial lines pricing - TRV is continuing to push for
price given weather, hardening reinsurance market, and inflationary environment; (2) in
personal lines, the RPC should slow as more states are at rate adequate levels (though the
Q4 underlying loss ratio should be about 6-7 points higher than other quarters of the year
due to seasonality); (3) investment income guidance raised and initial 2024 guide laid out
to reflect the higher interest rate environment.
Reserve color: Within BI, there was $132 million of favorable development in ongoing
businesses (away from the charges for A&E and reviver statutes), which included releases
in workers' compensation, offset by adverse development in commercial auto (the level
of which was not quantified, but it was due to the lengthening of development patterns
for bodily injury claims). BSI favorable development ($72M was driven by surety and
management liability; while PI ($37M) was due to homeowners.
BI margin discussion: TRV continues to get a good amount of price in BI (+7.9% RRC and
+12.9% RPC) yet the underlying loss ratio was virtually stable this year (60.6% vs 60.5% in
Q3 2022) as the impact of earned rate over trend was offset by other things that tend to
move around in any given quarter (and could include mix, base year adjustments, non-cat
weather). The net impact of all of these items was a modest unfavorable number which
offset the impact of earned rate over trend in the quarter.

Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the hard
commercial market as pricing should continue to have legs given
inflation and higher weather volatility. Although we are positive on
the commercial lines space as a whole, we are Equal Weight TRV due
to its smaller account exposure, higher workers' comp focus as both
are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes, and personal
lines exposure, particularly auto, which is well above target margins
of mid-90s.

What the Companies Are Saying-TRV
Outlook
In Business Insurance, written margins are expanding. Pricing has been strong and while core goods
inflation is moderating and medical inflation remains benign, Travelers is incorporating medical
inflation based on higher longer-term trends given the duration of its liabilities. Returns in BI remain
strong given continued firm pricing and higher fixed income investment income. However, given the
uncertainty in terms of weather volatility, economic and social inflation, hardening reinsurance market
and the geopolitical landscape TRV will continue to push for price increases to achieve its return
objectives.
Pricing
Within Business Insurance, the RRC accelerated sequentially in all lines but workers' comp. Within
comp, the RPC remains positive and appropriate given returns in the business line. Travelers also
provided guidance around its personal lines RPC, which we highlight in the guidance section below.
Guidance
The exhibit below highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2023/2024.
· Fixed income investment guide raised. The only precise guidance that Travelers provides is
around its quarterly view for fixed income plus short-term investment income, on an after-
tax basis. TRV is now looking for fixed income and short-term investment income to be $615
million in Q4 (up from $595 million). For 2024, the company is looking for quarterly fixed income
investment income to range between $630-690 million with the full year coming in at more than
$2.6 billion.
· Personal lines RPC guide. Within personal auto, the RPC should remain strong but begin to move
down from here (18.2% in Q3 as more of the book reaches rate adequacy on a written basis).
Within homeowners', the RPC (19.4% in Q3) should remain consistent through the end of the
year, and then it should moderate into the low double-digits as automatic increase in limit factors
returns to more normal levels reflective of stabilizing industry estimates of replacement costs.
· Personal lines Q4 underlying loss ratio. Travelers highlighted that its Q4 underlying loss ratio is
typically about 6-7 points higher than the other quarters of the year due to winter weather and
holiday driving.
Highlights of TRV's call included
commentary around pricing (in
BI and PI), reserve movements,
and its underlying loss ratio in BI.
Guidance was given around: (1)
fixed income investment income,
(2) PI RPC, (3) Q4 buyback, and
(4) Q4 PI underlying loss ratio.
Investments
As of 9/30, new money rates are about 180 basis points higher than rates embedded within the
portfolio. The changes to unrealized investment gains and losses do not change how TRV manages its
investment portfolio. The company generally holds fixed income investments to maturity.
Liquidity and Capital
TRV has $1.75 billion of capital at the holding company (up from just under $1.5 billion at the end of
2022 and the $2.0B at end of Q2) with all of their capital ratios at or better than target levels. The
catastrophe losses this year have results in lower YTD earnings than TRV expected and as a result they
expect the Q4 repurchases will likely be lower than the level of average quarterly repurchases in the
first half of the year. TRV has $6.1B left under its repurchase authorization as of 9/30.

Personal Lines-TRV Continues to See Rate Acceleration, Margins Remain Elevated
· Within Personal Auto, TRV saw renewal premium change continue to accelerate sequentially at
18.2%, which was up from the 16.2% last quarter; however, their auto underlying margin remained
above 100% for the sixth straight quarter (100.6% in Q3) but this did improve 330 basis points Y/Y
and 290 basis points from Q2. TRV did highlight that seasonality will cause the auto underlying loss
ratio to rise in Q4 (the Q4 underlying loss ratio in auto is typically 6-7 points higher than the other
quarters of the year due to winter weather and holiday driving).
. Homeowners' RPC accelerated modestly sequentially to a record-high 19.4% from the previous
record-high 19.0% in Q2.
. Auto PIFs decline sequentially, while home was close to flat. Travelers' new business in auto
decreased 7% Y/Y to $332 million, after also decreasing 7% Y/Y last quarter and marked the fourth
straight quarter with Y/Y declines as TRV continues to pull new business away from states where
they are not getting enough rate and abiding by stricter underwriting standards. Auto PIFs declined
0.1% sequentially (better than the 0.7% sequential decline in Q2). Home new business was down
8% in the Q3 (a deceleration from growth of 2% in Q2). From a PIF standpoint, home was close to
flat, which was a slowdown from the 0.5% sequential increase last quarter.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the hard commercial market as pricing should continue to have legs given inflation and
higher weather volatility. Although we are positive on the commercial lines space as a whole, we are Equal Weight TRV due to its smaller
account exposure, higher workers' comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes, and personal lines exposure,
particularly auto, which is well above target margins of mid-90s.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $172.00 from NC
. Our price target of $172 is based on just over 9x our 2024 EPS estimate of $18.60
. Implies around a ~1.65x multiple of our projected 2024 book value estimate of ~$105
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and reported / underlying margins coming in better
than expected.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
