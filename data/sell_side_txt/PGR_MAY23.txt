Progressive Corp.
May 23' Earnings: 16.3% Expense
Ratio Is a Record Low and Less
Sustainable over Long Term
Five consecutive months of adverse PYD on mounting severity
implies step level change. Loss picks (while up from April)
should show even more conservatism to be more in tandem on
what we are seeing within PYD.
Expense Ratio Record Low: PGR's 16.3% expense ratio in May hit a record low, following 16.9%
in April '23 and 17.3% in Dec. '22. A more sustainable expense ratio for PGR is >20%.
Fatigue on FL Legislation as a Driver of PYD: PGR cited FL legislation once again as a driver of
adverse PYD, we assumed that was "once and done." PGR also appears to be the lone insurer
citing this FL issue, which gives us pause. Unlike 1Q adverse PYD were PGR cited higher auto
property and physical damage, the key drivers of adverse PYD for April and May were bodily
injury and PIP. In general, we are cautious about Progressive's undeterred stance with respect to
social inflation. Peers vocalize more concerns about higher attorney representations more than
PGR, especially on the commercial auto side. Conversely, we continue to expect severity
pressures to lead to adverse PYD, and model a 20% haircut in the preceding months in our
forecast period (i.e., 3.7 pts in June and 3.0 pts in July, etc.)
Combined ratio (i.e., bottom line) missed our estimates
PGR's combined ratio of 99.0% missed our estimated 95.9% and was above management's 96%
target (Personal Lines at 99.8% vs our estimated 94.7%, Commercial Lines at 97.6% vs our
estimated 96.9%, and Property at 91.4% vs our estimated 112.0%).
· PGR reported a fifth consecutive month of unfavorable PYD of $207.6mn (vs. $94.9mn
estimate) or 4.6pts on the loss ratio (vs. our 2.1 pt estimate). This follows 6.5 pts, 3.5 pts, 3.4
pts, and 2.6 pts of unfavorable PYD in January, February, March, and April, respectively.
o We estimate that adverse PYD hurt the personal lines auto loss ratio by 5.0 pts, as
personal auto represented 85% of total PYD due to FL claims and higher severity (PIP
and BI). Commercial auto made up 20% of the unfavorable PYD (or 5.5 pts) due to claims
brought forward ahead of FL reform implementation. Property had a favorable
development (5% of PYD) due to actuarial changes.
· PGR's underlying loss ratio of 73.2%, was slightly worse than our estimated 73.1%. PGR
took $172.2mn of actuarial adverse adjustments, or 3.8 pts. We would have expected a
Barclays Capital Inc. and/or one of its affiliates does and seeks to do business with companies

conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this

higher loss pick given the company's concerns about severity and needing to take rate. We
question if PGR's loss picks are too optimistic and would be subject to re-estimates (i.e.,
unfavorable PYD) in future periods.
· PGR's expense ratio was 16.3%% in May vs. 17.1% in Apr, and 21.1% in Mar. We estimated a
18.3% expense ratio. To recap, PGR's pre-pandemic expense ratio ran just north of 20%.
· PGR reported catastrophe losses of $220mn vs our $108mn estimate.
Top-line growth (Policies in Force and Net Investment Income) underperformed our
expectations
Personal auto PIF grew +0.7% sequentially (May '23 vs. Apr '23), below the previous +1.9%
sequential print (Apr '23 vs. Mar '23). On an annualized basis, that would imply PIF growth of 8%
though we do not expect monthly growth to be constant over 12 months; in fact, it continued to
decelerate by month. On a y/y basis, PGR recognized +14.3% personal auto PIF growth.
PGR's pre-tax net investment income (ex expenses) this month was $154mn vs. our $142mn
estimate, reflecting a 3.2% pre-tax annualized book yield.
May operating EPS of $0.23 missed our $0.41 estimate, reflecting a higher combined ratio due to
worse-than-expected PYD and catastrophes losses.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 152.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~21x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 110.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~15x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +14.3% in May (below our estimate of +15.2%), as
auto agency PIF (+10.0% vs. our +10.6%) and auto direct (+17.8% vs. our 19.0%)
underperformed our estimates.

Underlying combined ratio - Lower expense ratio is
less sustainable over the long term
PGR's underlying combined ratio of 89.5% in May deteriorated from 88.1% in Apr. and 98.6% in
Mar. driven by a worse underlying loss ratio of 73.2% (vs. 71.0% in Apr.) somewhat offset by a
lower expense ratio (16.3% in May vs 17.1% in Apr. and 21.1% in Mar.) While we were expecting a
lower-than-typical expense ratio, PGR's 16.3% expense ratio in May hit a record low.
The construction of PGR's underlying combined ratio is different than pre-pandemic. To recap,
PGR's pre-pandemic underlying loss ratio stood at ~68% and expense ratio ran just north of
20%. We think a reversion to this pre-pandemic composition would be positive for the stock.

'19, Manheim pricing is still up 47.4%. Compounded auto pricing during that period has not
caught up - not anywhere close. There is still significant rate catch-up needed to see that
inflection point. It will be like an "x"; loss costs go down, then pricing goes up - where the two
intersect in our view can take a bit longer, especially given how long it is taking auto pricing to
actually "earn" in.
Manheim pricing was -2.7% m/m and -7.6% y/y. More importantly, if we compare May '23 to May

Valuation
Our PT of $120 (was $123) is based on 16.5x (unchanged) our new '24E EPS and 3.20x
(unchanged) '24E BVPS (ex AOCI).
Model Updates:
We increase our loss ratio expectations to reflect lower expense ratio and the continuation of
adverse PYD reflecting higher severity expectations. Lastly, we are using a 3-month average
AYLR as a starting point in June.
Debt raise: In May, PGR raised $500mn in senior unsecured notes (due in 2033) at a fixed
coupon of 4.95%. PGR intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. We have
raised our interest expense following the raise by ~6mn/quarter and ~$25mn annually.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

*This is the closing price referenced in the publication, which may not be
the last available closing price at the time of publication.
Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $120PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double-digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
