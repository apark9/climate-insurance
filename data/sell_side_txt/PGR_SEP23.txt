September '23: Catastrophe loss
breather & underlying loss ratio
improving
Reserve development alternation: Sept - modest favorable PYD,
August unfavorable, July favorable, June (and prior months)
unfavorable. Given the volatility of reserve development in
recent months, we cannot point to a definitive trend.

PGR's underlying loss ratio of 71.5% (vs. our estimated 76.9%) improved sequentially from
74.6% in August '23. Its underlying loss ratio has been bouncing around in recent months (74.6%
in August, 72.5% in July, and 76.6% in June). We would like to see more sustainability of results,
though we recognize this month's notable improvement.
In September, PGR reported marginal favorable PYD of $8mn (vs. $58mn unfavorable estimate)
or (0.2) pts on the loss ratio (vs. our 1.3 pt estimate). This follows 1.6 pts, 3.1 pts, 4.6
pts, 4.6 pts, 3.4 pts, 3.5 pts, and 6.5 pts of unfavorable PYD in August, June, May, April, March,
Feb., Jan., respectively. July was the outlier with a favorable PYD of 0.5 pts. Despite a quiet PYD
quarter, we are not revising our unfavorable PYD pts on the loss ratio estimates of 0.9% in Oct.,
0.6% in Nov., and 0.3% in Dec.

PGR's expense ratio of 16.6% in Sept. (from 16.5% in August and 15.4% in July) is not enough of
a boost for us to believe approaching rate adequacy is closer in reach. We anticipate seeing
PGR return to its pre-pandemic expense ratio of nearly 20% only when pricing is adequate and it
can organically grow statutory surplus.

PGR reported quiet catastrophe losses of $84mn (vs our $106mn estimate) or 1.8pts on its
consolidated combined ratio; PGR received a $21mn reinsurance recoverable in the quarter (9.5
pt favorable impact to its property loss ratio.) Nice reprieve following elevated catastrophe loss
ratio points of 4.5% in August, 3.2% in July, and an average monthly cat loss ratio points of 4.1%
in 1H23.

Personal auto PIF shrunk 0.1% sequentially (Sept '23 vs. Aug '23), better than the previous -0.6%
sequential print (Aug '23 vs. July '23) and better than our estimated sequential PIF decline of
(0.8)%. On an annualized basis, that would imply PIF compression of ~1% although we do not
expect monthly trend to be constant over 12 months. On a y/y basis, PGR recognized +12.0%
personal auto PIF growth, down from +12.6% in August y/y.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 148.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~25x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 105.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~18x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
Personal Auto PIF Declined by 10k M/M
Personal auto PIF was down 10k (September '23 vs. August '23), better than the
previous decline of 115k sequential print (August '23 vs. July '23) and better than estimated
164k decline estimate.
On a y/y basis, PGR reported personal auto PIF growth of +12.0% in September (above our
estimate of +11.1% y/y), with auto agency PIF +10.0% (vs. our +9.4%) and auto direct
+13.5% (vs. our 12.4%).

Underlying combined ratio - Lower expense ratio is
less sustainable over the long term
PGR's underlying combined ratio of 88.1% in September improved from 91.1% in August, driven
by a better underlying loss ratio of 71.5% (vs. 74.6% in August) and offset slightly by a
modestly higher expense ratio (16.6% in September vs. 16.5% in August).
The construction of PGR's underlying combined ratio is different than pre-pandemic. To
recap, PGR's pre-pandemic underlying loss ratio stood at ~68% and expense ratio ran just north
of 20%. We think a reversion to this pre-pandemic composition would be positive for the stock.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
Motor insurance pricing remains subdued relative to used car pricing using a 2019 base year
(see Figure 3). Specifically, used car & truck pricing is up 33.9% vs. motor insurance pricing at
29.6% since Jan. '19. Compounded auto pricing during that period has not caught up - not
anywhere close. There is still rate catch-up needed to see that inflection point.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life
AIG, Inc. (AIG)
Chubb Limited (CB)
Lemonade, Inc. (LMND)
Allstate Corp. (ALL)

M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $111 PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double-digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
