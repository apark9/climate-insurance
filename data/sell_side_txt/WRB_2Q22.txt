W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
WRB: In Growth Mode; Q2 EPS and Conference Call Round-Up
Our Call
Summary. WRB reported Q2 2022 EPS of $1.12 vs. our of $0.84 and consensus of $0.86.
Relative to us, the $0.28 beat vs. us was driven by: (1) stronger net investment income
(in both the core portfolio and its investment funds), (2) better results in the Insurance
segment on a more favorable expense ratio, (3) and lower corporate expenses (including
$40 million of foreign exchange gains), all partially offset by modestly lower earnings
in Reinsurance & Monoline Excess vs. us. Catastrophe losses came in at $57.9 million,
modestly higher than our $54.0 million estimate, and prior year reserve development was
$2 million favorable vs. our estimate for adverse development of ($0.5) million.
路 Raising estimates and price target. Following WRB's conference call, we are raising
our 2022 EPS estimate to $4.25 from $3.88, while our 2023 EPS estimate goes
to $4.90 from $4.75, and our 2024 EPS estimate goes to $5.85 from $5.70, with
changes primarily reflecting higher net investment income as well as tweaking our
expense ratio within Insurance lower and our underlying loss ratio in Reinsurance &
Monoline Excess higher. Our new price target is $83 from $81, based on 2.7x our
2023 book value per share estimate (2.4x ex. AOCI), a multiple just under 17x our
2023 EPS. Shares of WRB should get a lift tomorrow owing to the earnings beat and
still bullish outlook on the E&S market.
路 Pricing commentary and growth outlook. WRB saw price increases of 6.8% in the
Q2 excluding workers' comp. This compares to 8.3% in Q1, 9.3% in Q4, and 10.1% in
Q3. Overall, WRB described market conditions as favorable with business continuing
to come to the E&S market. Additionally, with more lines at rate adequate levels
(following years of getting rate), the company is focusing on exposure growth to drive
its top-line. Over the course of the next 12-24 months, WRB thinks the workers'
comp market will turn due to a reflection of the severity of losses in the line and also
years of seeing prices erode.
路 Underlying margin improvement driven by the loss and expense ratio. The
underlying combined ratio was 86.2%, better than our 86.8% estimate. The underlying
loss ratio of 58.5% (versus our 58.3%) improved by 30 basis points from last Q2 and
was 20 basis points higher than Q1 2022. The expense ratio came in at 27.7%, better
than our 28.5% estimate, and below the guided 28-29%.
. Duration discussion. Berkley said that over time they will look to add to their duration
as rates move up, but it will not happen overnight and will be gradual. Further, it
seems like they will always have a mismatch between the duration of their assets and
liabilities. The duration today sits at 2.4 years. Currently, we are modeling a core fixed
income portfolio yield for 2023 and 2024 of 3.11% and 3.59%, respectively, vs. the
fixed income yield in the quarter of 2.57%. Management pointed to the fact that it is
currently putting new money to work at 4-4.25%.
路 Strong double-digit premium growth. Net premiums written grew 16.9% vs. our
15.4% estimate and vs. the 15-25% range WRB has previously spoken to. By segment,
insurance net written premiums grew 16.6% vs. our 16.4% estimate, and reinsurance
grew 19.1% vs. our 6.8% estimate. Within insurance, WRB saw the strongest growth
in short-tail lines (+23.8%), other liability (+21.9%), and commercial auto (+20.1%).
Growth slowed in professional lines (to 3.5%) due to WRB pulling back on public D&O
exposure due to the absence of IPOs and SPACs. Reinsurance growth was driven by
casualty and monoline excess, as property reinsurance declined.

Q2 2022 In A Nutshell
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q2 2022 EPS of $1.12 vs. our of $0.84 and consensus of $0.86. Relative
to us, the $0.28 beat vs. us was driven by: (1) stronger NII, (2) better results in the Insurance segment
on a more favorable expense ratio, (3) and lower corporate expenses, all partially offset by modestly
lower earnings in Reinsurance & Monoline Excess vs. us. Catastrophe losses came in at $57.9 million,
modestly higher than our $54.0 million estimate, and PYD was $2 million favorable vs. our estimate for
adverse development of ($0.5) million. Investment income came in at $171.6 million, better than our
$131.8 million estimate due to better returns within both the core portfolio and its investment funds.
Catastrophe losses came in at $57.9 million, just above our $54 million estimate. There was a minimal
$2 million of prior period favorable development in the quarter, better than our estimate for adverse
reserve development of ($0.5) million. The underlying combined ratio of 86.2% beat our 86.8%
estimate, driven by a better expense ratio, with the underlying loss ratio coming in slightly higher
than us (at 58.5% versus our 58.3% estimate). WRB didn't repurchase any shares in the quarter, while
we had modeled a $50 million buyback. The operating ROE was 18.8%, and the net income ROE was
10.8%. Book value per share declined (5.1%) QoQ, but declined (0.7%) YoY in the Q2.
Showing the conservatism within its margins, WRB highlight that the paid loss ratio was 41.9%, better
when compared to 44.3% in Q2 2021, 52.9% in 2020, 53.8% in 2019, 58.3% in 2018, and 55.9% in
2017. Further, WRB continued to highlight that they are being conservative with their loss trend
assumptions.

Highlights of WRB Pricing Thoughts
Healthy pricing trends persist, even with some deceleration. WRB saw price increases of 6.8%, excluding workers' comp (the price
increase with workers' comp will be available with the 10-Q). This slowed from 8.3% in Q1 and 9.3% in Q4. Overall, WRB described market
conditions as remaining favorable, and they do not see that trend changing in 2022. In particular, they see this as a good environment
for specialty insurers and even more for the E&S market, where they continue to see a good flow of opportunities, which they do not
think will be impacted by any new market entrants. Exhibit 2 below shows recent commentary that WRB has provided on pricing since H2
2019.
Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period
Pricing Comments
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to
see resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth
target, which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust. i
In workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity
and erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated
from that. Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable
momentum, up 45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business
pricing is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take
rate as weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the
market eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come
back.
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something
measured in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious
and most of the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very
aggressive on WC pricing in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty
overwhelming at this stage, particularly in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any
current opportunities.
Q4 2021
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a
growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably
attractive. And we don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly
casualty-related specialty writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both
in specialty and even more so in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime
soon. So that's definitely encouraging.
Q3 2021
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of
workers; compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view of loss trend. And that is even as we
have been factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some
might as the rate increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the
prior year. The simple fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that
are available in the business. And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about possibly how we re-
prioritize exposure of growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q2 2021
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the prior two being the
early 2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to
take advantage of the hardening market environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of
three years, while most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the
E&S market, driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased
audit premiums; and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are at or approaching
rate adequacy with the exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the
example of professional liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more
recently and workers' comp is in a soft market.

Period
Pricing Comments
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting meaningful rate increases.
And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many product lines where we have been getting rate
on rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.
The market is clearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think that is very appropriate.
And whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and 2002 and 2003, we will only see with time. But the
reality is, no cycle looks like any other cycle. When WRB looks at Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of
workers' compensation, is achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are
seeing meaningful firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella market, while property
continues to be notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL and but over the past couple
of quarters that seems to be building some momentum.
Q4 2020
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are becoming more acute. As far as
workers' compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is more likely than not to begin to firm as we make our way
into 2021 or sometime next year. The loss ratios that WRB selected at the beginning of the year assumed that they would not
be outpacing loss cost trend by the level that they are. The rate increases throughout the year, by and large, are above and
beyond what was anticipated. Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and specifically social inflation, WRB has
deliberately decided to take a wait-and-see attitude.
Q3 2020
We saw the firm market accelerate throughout 2019 and it continued to accelerate into 2020, very evident in Q1. The evidence
of this was demonstrated, at least in part by business leaving the standard market, making its way to the specialty market and
in particular, the E&S market. Rate increases were at a level not seen in some number of years and there was a reduction in
capacity that various carriers were offering. All of these things were being driven by two major factors: (1) low interest rate
environment and a knock-on effect for what that means for investment income; and (2) loss cost trends, driven to a great extent
by social inflation, which had been benign for an extended period of time and then crept up on the industry when it was least
expecting it and it has proven to be much more of an issue.
Q2 2020
Q1 2020
Rate increases that continue to progress in response to past conversations around social inflation and keeping up with loss
costs.
The challenges that the market faces has stemmed from a low interest rate environment, frequency of cat activity, and social
inflation has gotten to the point where it is no longer solely being talked about but it is actually being acted upon. This is a
meaningful sea change that became very visible in the Q4, and there is no sign of that slowing down. WRB said that they were
excited about what was in front of us. They were enthusiastic earlier in 2019, and the Q4 2019 built on that enthusiasm. Further
WRB said that while there are some that would suggest that they tend to be an optimistic organization, and that is a fair
statement, the data that they see in their business and the data the industry data supports this optimistic view.

Exhibit 3 below shows WRB's pricing trends (excluding Workers' Compensation) relative to
MarketScout since 2017. In Q2, WRB's rate (ex. WC) was 6.8% vs. MarketScout of 5.9%. This compares
to Q1 2022 WRB rate of 8.3% and 2021 average rate of 10.5%. MarketScout's Q1 2021 rate was 6.0%
and 2021 average rate was 6.4%. Pricing slowed again for WRB in Q2, but management pointed to
the idea that it was not writing property cat business (which was seeing outsized rate) and that it has
shifted its focus to exposure growth with the view that most lines are now rate adequate.

Additional Thoughts On The Quarter
See below for an overview of additional thoughts on Q2 2022 earnings versus our estimates.
路 Premium growth close to us and remained in the double digits. Gross written premium growth
of 14.7% was below our 17.3% estimate, while net written premium growth of 16.9% came in
above our 15.4% estimate (and it was close to 17.7% in Q1). By segment, insurance net written
premium growth of 16.6% was close to our 16.4% estimate, driven by growth in all lines (with the
strongest growth in other liability, short-tail lines, and commercial auto), while reinsurance growth
of 19.1% was above our 6.8% estimate, driven by growth in casualty reinsurance and monoline
excess. Earned premium growth of 19.6% was just above our 19.2%.
. Net investment income above us. Net investment income of $171.6 million beat our $131.8
million estimate due to better results within the core portfolio and its investment funds. Core
portfolio income of $133.6 million was above our $117.1 million estimate, while investment funds
of $33.9 million was above our $11.7 million, arbitrage trading accounts of $4.1 million did come in
a bit above our $33.0 million estimate. The investment yield on the core portfolio was 2.57% was
up from 2.14% in Q1, 2.04% in Q4, 2.00% in the Q3 and 2.03% last Q2.
. Other revenues above us. Revenues from non-insurance businesses was $128.4 million versus our
$100 million estimate, insurance service fees was $26.4 million above our $24.0 million estimate,
and other income of $0.9 million slightly beat our $0.5 million estimate.
. Combined ratio beat us on better expense ratio. The combined ratio of 88.6% beat our 89.2%
estimate due to a lower expense ratio. The insurance combined ratio was 88.7%, a beat versus our
89.6% estimate and the reinsurance combined ratio of 87.8% came in slightly above our 85.8%
estimate. The loss ratio was 60.9% versus our 60.7% estimate, while the expense ratio of 27.7%
beat our 28.5% estimate, and it seems like WRB could maintain an expense ratio close to the Q1
level. Catastrophe losses of $57.9 million (2.5 points) were just above our $54.0 million (2.3 point)
estimate. WRB did not call out any Covid-19 losses this quarter.
路 Underlying results beat us mostly on better expense ratio. The underlying combined ratio
was 86.2% versus our 86.8% estimate, due to a stronger-than-forecasted expense ratio, while
the underlying loss ratio of 58.5% was just above our 58.3% estimate, and improved by 30 basis
points from last Q2. The insurance underlying combined ratio of 86.9%, was better than our 87.4%
estimate driven by a better expense ratio with the insurance underlying loss ratio coming in at
59.2%, just above our 59.1% estimate. The reinsurance underlying combined ratio came in at
81.5%, missing our 82.9% estimate due to a weaker loss ratio. The reinsurance underlying loss
ratio was 54.1%, higher than our 52.9% estimate. In getting the segment underlying loss ratios
we attribute all the favorable reserve development to the insurance segment (WRB provides the
breakout of its reserve development in its 10Q/10K).
路 Capital return below us given lack of buyback. WRB did not repurchase shares during the quarter,
versus our 0.7 million shares for $50 million estimate, and no repurchases over the past two
quarters. Including dividends (regular and special), total capital return was $159.2 million, or 50.8%
of operating earnings of $313.4 million.
Summary Of Estimate Changes
Estimates Move Up on Higher Investment Income. See Exhibit 5 below for an overview of our
estimate changes following Q2 2022 earnings. Post WRB's conference call, we are raising our 2022
EPS estimate to $4.25 from $3.88, reflecting the $0.28 beat in the Q2 and higher investment income
in Q3/Q4. Our 2023 and 2024 EPS move up by $0.15 in each year to $4.90 and $5.85 (from $4.75
and $5.70), primarily reflecting higher investment income as new money rates have marched higher
and WRB has begun moderately lengthening the duration of its portfolio. Currently, we model a core
fixed income portfolio yield for 2023 and 2024 of 3.11% and 3.59%, respectively, vs. the fixed income
yield in the quarter of 2.57%. Management pointed to the fact that it is currently putting new money
to work at 4-4.25%.

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB currently trades at 2.39x Q2 2022 book value, which compares to the 5-
year and 10-year average multiples of 1.91x and 1.64x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 1.40x
and 10-year minimum is 1.11x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 2.71x, which occurred in April 2021
as the stock reached new highs. We note that unrealized losses driven by higher interest rates and
credit spreads have served to suppress book value growth somewhat, and when excluding AOCI, WRB
shares are trading at just over 2.2x adjusted Q2 book. On a P/E basis, WRB is trading at 13.1x our 2023
EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year average multiples of 19.2x and
16.9x, respectively. It is also at the 5-year minimum, which was also 13.1x (during the low point of the
pandemic) but above the 10-year minimum is 10.4x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 25.0x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases
in 2022 which should translate into a good level of premium growth and underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is
currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $83.00 from $81.00
Our price target of $83 is based on a 2.7x multiple of our year-end 2023 book value estimate. Our price target also represents a ~17.0x
multiple against our 2023 EPS estimate. The 17x is a premium to the standard commercial players given that WRB is showing better
growth. Further, it is a discount to its peak historical multiples, further supporting the choice of multiple in our view.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe and/or Covid-19 losses.

W.R. Berkley Corporation
Equity Research
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
