4Q22 Earnings Review: 2023 Outlook
HIG anticipates 1 pt of improvement within its underlying
combined ratio (Commercial ex WC) in '23. Execution would
largely depend on expense savings and business mix shifts with
less upside from Global Specialty in '23.
On the surface HIG's '23 outlook appears somewhat ambitious with ROE expansion of 100 bps
from its '22 outlook despite WC and financial lines headwinds. It comes down to execution
which is achievable in our view. Hartford NEXT progress in 2023 would need to show 0.5 a pt of
improvement on the expense ratio side. Portfolio construction would be key. HIG's E&S small
commercial lines business is still in the nascent stage with only $100mn in writings vs. $8bn
TAM. HIG expects meaningful pricing increases, i.e. >30% for U.S. and European products. Lastly,
HIG sounded constructive on leaning more in on property writings across various businesses.
HIG is seeing pricing increases within commercial property, auto and general liability somewhat
offset pressures within financial lines. The swing factor is loss trend. HIG thinks commercial
loss cost trends remains fairly stable with some easing in inflationary forces on property in
2H23. We have not seen inflation play out as much on the casualty side vs. property side so far,
we would not preclude the possibility of rising loss trend for casualty in 2023.
WC pricing to be flat to slightly negative compressing the commercial lines underlying
combined ratio by 0.5% in 2023, according to HIG. Audit premiums had been in tailwind in '22
as a component of these premiums acted like rate. A weaker job outlook may reverse this trend
in '23.
Global Specialty may be a lesser contributor to '23 underwriting profitability vs. '22.
Especially on the public D&O side. The spread of pricing vs loss trend has converged (see figure
1). Global specialty contributed ~1/3 of underlying underwriting profitability for commercial in
'22, that proportion could lessen in '23 raising the importance of underwriting profitability from
other segments. Still, on a NPE standpoint, higher written pricing in this segment should still be
earning in during â€˜23.

remained stable in the mid-single digits, and in aggregate, in line with loss cost trends."

A&E ADC Erosion to $256mn of limit remaining at 4Q22. HIG's 2022 A&E gross loss experience
(subject to its ADC) was $229mn, that was up from $155mn in 2021 and closer to $236mn in
2020. We are assuming a ~$200mn annual gross A&E loss run rate. We are estimating some ADC
recovery in 2024 from remaining limit muting the blow just a tad with full gross losses
materializing in core earnings starting in 2025.
NII: HIG reiterated ex LLP yields up ~50 to 60 bps in 2023 from 2022, yet 4Q22 fixed income yield
of ~6% was more of an anomaly. As such q/q yield enhancements will be relatively more muted
given a higher exit '22 starting point. Likewise, HIG's view on LLP & alternatives returns is more
tepid heading into '23, down to 4%-6% (vs. a 8%-10% normal run rate).
Peer Leading P&C ROE: HIG's core ROE of 14.4% is above the upper end of its 13-14% '22
guidance. HIG provided updated 2023 guidance for core ROE of 14%-15% (vs. BARC 14.2%
estimate). In particular, its core ROE in P&C of 16.6% in 4Q22 is peer leading and ahead of its
segment guide of 14-15%. HIG's core ROE within group benefits of 10.9% and on the upper end
of its segment guide of 10-11%. Lastly, Hartford Funds core ROE of 46.1% is trending below its
segment guide of 54-55%. Note, HIG excludes AOCI from the denominator of its CORE ROE.
Higher HoldCo. coverage thanks to greater dividends from Group Benefits subsidiaries.
Sources of HoldCo. capital sources include net P&C dividends of $1.5bn, group benefits
dividends of $400mn, and Hartford Funds of $125mn. We think HIG has bandwidth to somewhat
augment capital returns in '23. Dividends from subsidiaries were $1.8bn in 2022, at the top of its
$1.7-1.8bn guide.

Why OVERWEIGHT?
HIG has sound fundamentals
following transformation, which
should continue to drive a stronger
book multiple. ROE convergence
with peers should make current
valuation look inexpensive.
Navigators acquisition is becoming
more accretive given boost from
hard pricing in specialty lines. HIG
has accelerated the pace of its
expense savings plans.
Upside case
USD 95.00
Our upside case reflects stronger
than expected underwriting margin
expansion and commercial P&C
pricing levels and improving group
benefits margins. Our upside case is
~1.4x '24 BVPS ex AOCI.
Downside case
USD 70.00
Our downside case assumes
unsuccessful underwriting margin
expansion and expense savings as
well as a slowdown in the
commercial P&C renewal rate
environment. Our downside case is
~7.5x '24E EPS.

4Q22/FY2022 vs. Target Financial Plan
HIG's personal lines underlying CR was 96.2% in 4Q22, above its revised FY22 guided range of
91-94% (updated in 2Q22 by ~1 - 2 points above the high end of the Feb. '22 provided range). For
the full year, personal lines underlying CR was 93.7%, on the higher end of the expected range.
Commercial lines underlying CR of 87.4% in 4Q22 was in-line with the 2022E outlook range mid-
pt of 87.5% (86.5%-88.5% range). Commercial lines underlying CR for FY2022 was 88.3%, on the
higher end of the projected range. Group Benefits core earnings margin for FY2022 came in at
6.5% vs. the company's 6%-7% range for 2022 and the outlook for 2023 is in the same range.

Outlook Update: 2023
Key Business Segments
Commercial lines underlying CR is expected to be in the 87%-89% range for 2023 (BARC
estimate of 88.3%). HIG anticipates 1 pt of improvement within its underlying combined ratio
(Commercial ex WC) in '23 to somewhat offset the 0.5 pt drag from WC. To get there, about half
of the ex- WC underlying margin expansion stems from expense ratio savings.
HIG projects underlying CR for personal lines to be in the range of 93%-95% in 2023 (BARC
estimate of 94.0%).
HIG provided a P&C expected CAY cat ratio of 4.2% for 2023 (vs. 4.8% in 2022 and BARC estimate
of 5.2%).
Group Benefits core earnings margin is projected to be 6-7% (vs. 6.5% in 2022 and BARC
estimate of 7.0%).
NII: While portfolio yields should continue to pick up in '23 (HIG reiterated ex LLP yields up ~50
to 60 bps in 2023 from 2022), HIG's 4Q22 fixed income yield of ~6% was more of an anomaly. As
such q/q yield enhancements will be more muted given a higher exit '22 starting point. The
company saw new money yields of 5.0%-5.1% in January, which is more in-line with company
expectations. Likewise, HIG's view on LLP & alternatives returns is more tepid heading into '23,
down to 4%-6% (vs. a 8%-10% normal run rate).
Core ROE up to 14-15% for '23 up 100bps from '22 outlook range of 13-14%. Actual 2022
Core ROE was 14.4%. We are estimating 14.2% for '23 and 15.0% for '24.

Personal Lines
While HIG achieved auto rate increase approvals of 8.3% in 4Q22 from ~5% in 3Q22, it is down
from its prior forecast of double-digits in 4Q. The rate approvals HIG achieved, we think take
longer to earn in, especially considering that the bulk of its inforce is still on 12-month policies.
(Note, its more recent marketing efforts for Prevail are centered on 6-month policies). HIG
expects to accelerate renewal written pricing to the mid-teens by 2Q23 and stabilize there for

the rest of the year. The company projects they will be price adequate by mid-year and sees loss
cost trends remaining elevated in 1H23 and then decreasing to normalized levels in 2H23.
The auto underlying combined ratio of 108.9% was up 6.3 pts sequentially (3.5 pts y/y). In 4Q21,
HIG shared its view of the 4Q auto loss ratio generally running 3 to 5 pts higher on average in 4Q
vs. the year. In 4Q22, HIG shared a lower 75 bps of adverse seasonality on the auto loss ratio.
Conversely, 1Q auto loss costs run lower than the balance of the year.
HIG saw continued severity pressure, most evident in physical damage that was driven by repair
costs that are elevated. HIG also mentioned increased bodily injury trends, although a less
significant driver.
The homeowners underlying combined ratio of 68.3% was down 12.1 pts q/q. HIG is also
pushing for rate on the homeowners side with 13% rate increases seen in 4Q22 (11% for
FY2022).
The loss ratio for Personal lines decreased to 74.4% in 4Q22 compared to 82.5% in 3Q22 thanks
to homeowners though it was up from 65.7% in 4Q21.
Personal Lines PIF slightly down
On the personal auto side, HIG's -0.6% PIF decline q/q in this business is more in line with
historical trend compared to last quarter's +1.2% growth q/q.
HIG saw renewal written pricing of +13.3% in homeowners in 4Q22 and +10.7% for FY22.
Homeowners earned pricing is expected to track closely to loss cost trends throughout 2023.

Underlying Commercial Margin
Commercial lines underlying margin improved by 1.5pts y/y and 1.9 pts q/q to 87.4%. HIG is
targeting commercial lines underlying combined ratio of 87%-89% in 2023 from 88.3% in 2022
(BARC estimate 88.3%).
Segment Underlying Results:
Â· Middle & Large Commercial underlying combined ratio of 90.2% in 4Q22 improved from
93.7% in 3Q22.
Â· Small Commercial underlying combined ratio at 87.5% in 4Q22 improved from 88.5% in
3Q22.
Â· Global Specialty underlying combined ratio of 83.0% in 4Q22 improved from 84.5% in 3Q22
and improved y/y by 5.8 points.
Pricing from Here
Commercial Lines pricing ex workers' compensation was +6.4% in 4Q22, although down from
peak price increases seen in 2021.
Workers Compensation: Healthy wage growth has alleviated pure rate declines, as such WC
pricing (rate and exposure) remained positive in 4Q22. Essentially, WC claims are equally split
between medical and indemnity (according to NCCI). Therefore, higher wages in '22 had led to
positive audit premiums, this component acts like rate since it does not have a corresponding
increase on the medical side (as long as trend remains at current 5% level) just indemnity side.
However in 2023, HIG expects WC exposure that acts like rate to be flat to slightly negative
leading to a 0.5 pt compression on the '23 commercial lines underlying combined ratio.
NCCI and many state rating bureaus use a three year experience period in determining indicated
rate needs for WC. As such, as lower frequency years 2019-2021 exit the calculation HIG
anticipates a reversal of negative pure rate trend beginning in '24.
Homeowners pricing has accelerated in 2022 (+9.0% in 2Q22, +11.8% in 3Q22, and +13.3 in
4Q22). HIG expects Homeowners earned pricing to keep pace with loss cost trends in 2023.

1/1 Reinsurance Renewal change
Slightly higher retention
Per Occurrence XOL, retention up to $150mn from $100mn. $50mn deductible was dropped. HIG
is now retaining 40% coinsurance from the prior 30%. Aggregate treaty attachment point raised
by $50mn to $750mn. While these are not wholesale changes, net/net HIG is retaining
moderately more risk, coupled with inflation. Therefore, we are modeling a higher cat ratio
of 5.2% higher than the company's 4.2% per its '23 outlook (that only moved up 10 bps from its
'22 guide).
Reinsurance costs rose ~20%, or 28% on a risk-adjusted basis. Even so, HIG does not believe
that higher costs would erode its '23 combined ratio.
Group Benefits
Core earnings margin of 8.3% in 4Q22 was above its '22 guidance of 6%-7%, and better than our
estimate of 7.4% in the quarter. Core earnings margin was 6.5% for the full year reflecting the
decline in excess mortality. HIG provided a 2023 core earnings margin guidance of 6%-7% (vs.
BARC estimate of 7.0%). HIG expects excess mortality losses are expected to improve y/y in 2023
yet stabilize above pre-pandemic levels, and is pricing accordingly.
Forward-Looking Commentary/Model Updates
Â· NII guide: Annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, to increase by ~50 to 60
bps in 2023 from 2022, a reiteration from 3Q22. HIG posted 3.2% (pre-tax) annualized yield,
ex LLP, in 2022. HIG is seeing increases in fixed maturity yield (average yield in 4Q22 was
~6%) although that is not the norm. The company saw new money yields of 5.0%-5.1% in
January, which is more in-line with company expectations. We are estimating yields ex LLP
of 3.75% for FY23 and 3.83% for FY24.
Â· HIG anticipates annualized LP returns in FY2023 to be in the range of 4%-6% (vs. a 8%-10%
guide last year) compared to 14.4% for FY2022 (comprised of a 22% real estate return and
14% private equity return). HIG expects private equity returns to be below their long-term
target in 2023 and expects to see less sales activity in their real estate JV.
Â· Capital Returns: During 4Q22 HIG repurchased $350mn of shares (vs. our $345mn
estimate). HIG has $2.75bn remaining on its board authorized buyback programs through
YE24. In 2023, HIG expects to receive $1.5bn of dividends from its U.S. P&C insurance
subsidiaries, $400mn from HLA (Group Benefits) and $125mn from Hartford Funds. HIG's
holding co. cash and marketable assets totaled $1.0bn as of Dec. 31, 2022. We are modeling
a $345mn quarterly buyback run-rate.

Barclays | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
We reiterate our Overweight rating on HIG and lower our PT to $87 (from $89) based on a
50/50 weighted 9.5x (unchanged) $9.34 (down from $9.62) '24E EPS and 1.3x (unchanged) 2024E
book value per share ex AOCI of $65.77 (down from $66.14). To be sure, we think HIG's '23
outlook guide is achievable, we are just now lower in the 14-15% ROE range to reflect pressures
on WC and financial lines. Likewise, we expect erosion to HIG's A&E ADC starting in '24 with a
partial recovery that forecast year.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $87 price target on HIG is based on a 50/50 weighted 9.5x '24E EPS and 1.3x 2024E book value per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.
