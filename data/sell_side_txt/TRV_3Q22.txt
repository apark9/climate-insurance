TRV: A Good Pricing View; Conference Call Round-Up
Our Call
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 10/19 to discuss Q3 results. The call focused
on the pricing environment and expected impact of Hurricane lan, the reinsurance
environment, and updated guidance around investment income and its expense ratio.
Our 2022, 2023 and 2024 EPS estimates are now $13.27, $15.35 and $17.85 (from
$12.66, $15.40 and $17.35). Our estimates reflect weaker personal auto results in 2023
and stronger investment income. Our price target is unchanged at $180. TRV traded up
(4.4%) versus the S&P 500 (down 0.7%) as the earnings beat and positive commercial
lines pricing view more than overshadowed pretty weak personal auto results.
· Commercial pricing should benefit from Hurricane lan. TRV sees the most upside
in property, while they expect workers' comp to remain muted given their strong
profitability in the line. They expect other commercial lines to see price increases in
the middle of the two (property and workers' comp). While TRV did see less cat loss
than others (and what we expect for others in the Q3) and is less impacted by higher
reinsurance costs, their commentary on the state of the P&C commercial lines market
should be a positive for all.
. Guidance updated for stronger NII. TRV raised their after-tax fixed income NII
guidance to $500 million for the fourth quarter of this year and provided a quarterly
estimate for 2023 with a range of $515 - $570 million. They said through a portion of
October with rates continuing to rise, new money yields are 200 bps higher than their
current embedded yields. Other guides included (1) an expense ratio less than 29%
for FY 2022 (previous guide was 29%) and (2) lower alternatives performance in the
fourth quarter relative to last year (which saw a 17% annualized return).
. Personal auto crashed the Q3 party. TRV saw an underlying combined ratio of
103.8% in personal auto, which was the highest since Q4 2017. The underlying loss
ratio of 81.6% was the worst since Q4 2016 and deteriorated by 870 bps year-over-
year. TRV highlighted they expect their RPC to hit double-digits in the fourth quarter
of this year, be in the mid-teens throughout 2023 and should reach written rate
adequacy in most states (that make up the majority of their business) between now
and mid-2023. In addition, they plan to tighten underwriting criteria, restrict binding
authority for certain agents and remove auto product from comparative raters in
California and Florida (which makes up about 16% of their auto book). Interesting to
us is that TRV looks to be growing through the loss spike as shown in the PIF and new
business growth in the quarter.
. Reinsurance prices should rise. TRV said they expect upward pressure on reinsurance
pricing going into 1/1 renewals as well as capital constraints. They mentioned they
would be less impacted than others in terms of pricing pressure as they (1) do not
buy as much reinsurance as others and (2) have a strong track record of underwriting
performance, which should allow them to obtain the reinsurance coverage they need
at acceptable rates.
· Capital color unchanged. TRV returned over 100% of operating earnings in the
quarter, which they said is not something that they would expect to continue. They
have been able to return more capital this year due to the robust capital position they
had at the end of 2021. They ended the quarter with more than $1.4 billion of holding
company liquidity and debt-to-total capital ratio of 21.8% (26.8% including after-tax
unrealized investments losses), which remains within their target of 15% to 25%.

Beat Versus The Street as BI Outperformance Makes Up For Personal
Insurance Struggles
The quarter in a nutshell. This morning (10/19), TRV reported Q3 core EPS of $2.20, beating our
$1.41 estimate, ad consensus of $1.54. TRV beat us on better other investments results as we
expected a (12%) return (TRV saw +2.5%), higher earned premium, and favorable PYD offset by higher
cats and a higher tax rate versus us. The tax rate was 15.3% vs. our 12.2%. The underlying combined
ratio of 92.5%, just beat our 92.6%, with Business Insurance (BI) and Bond & Specialty beating, while
Personal Lines (extremely poor results in both auto and home) missed. NPW rose by 10.5%, beating
our 4.8% due to stronger growth in all lines (strongest in personal lines). Repurchases were $500
million, ahead of our $450 million. Book value per share declined by 11.8% (due mostly to the mark to
market on the investment portfolio), and the core ROE was 7.9%.
Exhibit 1 below shows TRV's actual results versus our expectations and you can go here to see our first
look note on the quarter: TRV: 03 Beats on NII; Better BI Results Overshadow Weak Personal Lines

Takeaways for the Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us, and the laterals for the rest of the group are below.
Net-net, the biggest takes are that TRV is not seeing any change in its loss trend assumption and
pointed to the market hardening following Hurricane lan. Further, Travelers is also seeing high
frequency and severity trends within Personal Insurance. On the investment income side TRV
continues to see a benefit of the move up in interest rates (as shown in its higher investment income
guide) and for the Q4 they pointed to other investments showing a lower return than last Q4 and
given the strong results this quarter (especially given that the S&P was down 16% in Q2) we expect
alternatives could again exceed expectations in the Q4 (we are looking for an 8% return in Q4).
Highlights of the laterals that we see for the group follow below:
. Commercial lines pricing remains strong with Hurricane lan adding to the momentum. TRV
said that its renewal rates in BI were up 5.0% in the third quarter, modestly up from 4.9% in Q2,
and higher than the 4.4% in Q1. Rates staying above loss trend is a positive for the commercial
insurers.
· Personal lines continue to struggle. TRV showed a 99.3% underlying combined ratio in personal
insurance, which was well above our 96.3%, as personal auto saw an underlying combined ratio just
below 104%, which was also above our 101% estimate and the highest underlying combined ratio
since Q4 2017 and highest third quarter ratio since 2016. This highlights personal auto carriers
are still struggling to get enough rate to offset the elevated severity loss trends.
. Rate continues to exceed loss trends in BI and there is some upward momentum from
Hurricane lan. TRV said earned pricing was less than a point versus a point in the prior two
quarters. TRV also said that it did not move off of its loss-trend assumption in the quarter and
seemed to point to the potential for the RRC to improve sequentially in the Q4. TRV seeing
earned rate over loss trend implies that all commercial-lines underwriters (including CB and
HIG) should see underlying margin improvement this quarter.
· Exposure growth remains strong. Exposure growth remained at strong levels seeing an uptick
of 5.2% in Q3, modestly down from the 5.3% last quarter and up from the 4.2% in Q1, which
is a bullish sign for the insurance brokers. This adds to the good lateral we already have from
the good organic growth quarter from Truist. This appears to be a good sign for all insurance
brokers-given that TRV is more of a small-middle market insurer, it is the best take for AJG
and BRO, but does point to a good quarter for the group in general.
. Personal auto severity pressures results. TRV's Personal Auto book was affected by elevated
severity trends and to a lesser extent rising frequency trends. Further, TRV pointed to not seeing
rate adequacy in most states until the middle of 2023 (this would be on a written basis with
earned rate still needing to catch up with written). The Personal Auto underlying margin came in at
103.8%, which was the highest since Q4 2017 and the highest Q3 since at least 2014. The weaker
auto results at TRV (as well as PGR's September results) point to a tough quarter and rest of
2022 for the group.
. After-tax fixed Income NII revised up .... yet again. The company raised its guidance for fixed
income investment income of $500 million in Q4 (up from $495 million) and introduced a
quarterly range guide of $515 - $570 million for 2023 with expectations that Q1 is $515 million
and gradually increases to $570 million by Q4. This is a good lateral for most (if not all) insurers,
in our view.
· Stronger-than-expected alternative investment quarter. Alternative-related investment income
totaled $46 million, down from $197 million in Q2 and $281 million in the prior year quarter. We
assumed a loss of $174 million (12% negative return) had thought the weaker S&P performance
(down 16% in Q2) would lead to weaker alternative results given the one quarter lag on private
equity returns (see Exhibit 2 below for a breakdown of alternative portfolio by insurer). Given TRV
beat us, we could potentially see other insurers beat our alternative investment assumptions
as we built in a (12%) return into our models. Further, the Q4 could also be another good quarter
(we assume 8% annualized return) as TRV said that results would be weaker than last year (when
they saw an 17% annualized return in Q4).

Guidance Soundbites
Highlights of its guidance for 2022/2023. Exhibit 4 below highlights TRV's commentary and
expectations for 2022/2023. TRV revised its NII forecast up for Q4 and provided estimates for 2023.
In addition, they guided expense ratio to be below 29% (revised down from 29%) and also expect their
non-fixed book performance to be weaker than last year given the downturn in markets in the Q3
(reported on a one-quarter lag).
. Fixed income NII raised for Q4 and 2023. TRV raised its after-tax quarterly fixed income NII
(including short term securities) to be $500 million in Q4, which is up from the previous guide of
$495 million. They also provided a 2023 guide range of $515 - $570 million with expectations
Q1 is around $515 million and gradually increases to $570 million by Q4 as the book turns over.
New money rates through mid October are about 200 bps higher than what is embedded in the
portfolio currently, so NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over.
· Business Insurance pricing. During the Q&A, TRV mentioned that BI pricing exceed loss trends
by less than a point, which was down from the prior two quarters that saw a full point above
loss trends. They did not comment on any further projections but highlighted that despite the
moderation, rates and exposure has been stable in the last couple of quarters.
· Personal lines frequency/pricing. TRV mentioned that frequency continues to return towards
pre-pandemic driving and claim frequency levels. They expect RPC for the auto book to be in the
double-digits by Q4 this year with expectations for RPC to be in the mid-teens throughout 2023.
They expect to achieve written rate adequacy in most states (that make up the majority of their
business) between now and mid-2023.
· Aggregate reinsurance cover update. TRV has accumulated $1.4 billion toward the retention as of
the end of the Q3. With the aggregate cover, TRV gets $225 million of protection as part of $500
million of coverage above a $2 billion retention.
· Expense ratio revised down for 2022. TRV lowered expense ratio expectations for 2022 to
under 29%, which is favorable to the previous guide of 29% for 2022. They mentioned they feel
comfortable with the expense ratio around 29% but do not want to provide guidance for outer
years as it may shift around given business priorities.

Highlights of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of our estimate changes. The exhibit below highlights the changes we made to our earnings
model following 3Q 2022 earnings.
. 2022 EPS is revised up to $13.27 (from $12.66) to reflect higher net investment income and a
lower expense ratio, partially offset by a higher underlying loss ratio in personal insurance.
. 2023 EPS goes down to $15.35 (from $15.40) to reflect worse underlying margins in personal
insurance (both auto and home), mostly offset by a lower expense ratio, higher fixed investment
income, and higher earned premiums.
. 2024 EPS goes to $17.85 (from $17.35) to reflect higher fixed investment income and earned
premium, partially offset by weaker margins in auto and home.

Business Insurance Rating Environment-TRV Rates Rise, Still Above Loss Trend
· In Q3, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +5.0%, modestly accelerating from +4.9%
in the prior quarter and up from the 4.5% in Q1. Exposure growth was up 5.2%, modestly down
from 5.3% last quarter, but up from the 4.2% in Q1. The exhibits below show the recent trends in
TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal rate change. On their conference call,
they mentioned that overall pricing remains less than a point ahead of loss trends (modestly down
from the full point in the prior two quarters). They pointed to loss trends being in the 5.5% to 6.0%
range in their previous quarter conference call, which they said on the call they have not changed.
· TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC (in the summer of 2020), as the company was
unsure of how the economy would be affected by Covid-19. The company has yet to bring back
RPC forward guidance, but has pointed to margin improvement, as Business Insurance earned rate
remains in excess of loss trend. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains positive
in Q4 2022 with some level of moderation in 2023 as unit growth might slow but inflation should
continue to help pricing. On the call, they mentioned that exposure piece of rate is driven by 1)
unit growth and 2) inflation and that the inflation aspect is the more meaningful driver of margin
improvement.

Pricing Highlights - Personal Lines
Personal Lines-TRV Continues Push for Rate as Severity Remains Elevated, But Will Take Time to
Earn In
· Within Personal Insurance, TRV saw an acceleration in rate in personal auto in the quarter, as it
pushes for price. The RPC in auto was +8.1%, up from +6.5% last quarter and 4.2% in Q1. On the
auto side, they highlighted that margins continue to be impacted by higher severity and to a lesser
extent driving continuing to return to pre-pandemic levels. They expect RPC to reach double digits
in the fourth quarter and be in the mid-teens throughout 2023. They expect written pricing to
reach adequacy in most states (representing the majority of their business) between now and
mid-2023.
· Homeowners' pricing continued its acceleration, jumping a record-high 14.1% YOY, accelerating
from 13.5% last quarter and 12.3% in the Q1. They expect RPC to remain at these levels for the
remainder of 2022 and expect RPC to increase above these levels in 2023 as they implement
additional insured value increases.
· Still growing despite margin concerns. Travelers' new business in auto increased 12% sequentially,
and was up 20% when compared to last year, with auto new business premiums totaling $356
million, versus $318 million in the prior quarter. Home new business was up 3% sequentially, and
up 5% YOY at $327 million, versus $316 million in the prior quarter. Further, TRV still showed PIF
growth in auto despite the uptick in loss costs, up 1% sequentially and 5% YOY (see Exhibit 8 below),
which is counter to PGR who has been pulling back as they haven't been able to get enough price.

Valuation
Current valuation. The TRV shares are now trading at 2.05x Q3 book value, which is a 10-year high
and well above its 5-year (1.42x) average, and its 10-year (1.36x) average multiple. The P/B multiple
has increased as reported book value has seen pressure from unrealized losses on TRV's investment
portfolio; when excluding unrealized losses (net), shares are currently trading at 1.56x Q3 adjusted
book of $111.90 (more in line with the 5 and 10 year averages). On a price-to-earnings basis, the
shares are trading at 13.1x our updated 2022 EPS estimate and 11.3x our 2023 EPS estimate versus
the 5-year average of 11.9x, 10-year average of 11.5x and the 5-year and 10-year peak of 14.2x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will benefit from one of the hardest commercial pricing environment since 2003. Although we are positive on the
commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers due to its smaller account exposure and higher workers'
comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation, lower
reserve releases, and Covid-19, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral
and rate its shares Equal Weight as a result.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $180.00 from NC
Our price target of $180 is based on around a ~1.9x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $95.30 and 11.7x our
2023 EPS estimate of $15.35.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
