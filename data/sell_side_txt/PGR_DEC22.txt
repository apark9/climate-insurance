Dec. '22 Earnings: Slow Progression
Turning Around AYLR
While PGR is making sequential progress improving its AY loss
ratio, it is doing so at an anemic speed. Its AYLR has a way to go
to return to pre-pandemic levels (~68%). Sequential PIF growth
is slowing down, which we think is owed to capital constraints.

Potential Upside/Downside

The cost & sustainability of growth: Personal auto PIF grew +0.4% sequentially (Dec. '22 vs.
Nov. '22), down from +0.8% sequentially (Nov. vs. Oct.). On an annualized basis, that would
imply PIF growth of 5% vs. 10% (keeping monthly growth constant over 12 months). We
question the sustainability of growth, as PGR's premiums to surplus is near 3x. On a y/y basis,
PGR recognized positive personal auto PIF growth over the last 3 quarters (+2.6% Dec., +1.7%
Nov. and +0.5% in Oct.) PGR's pricing may appear more competitive as the insurer believes
taking rates is behind them, a sentiment that we think is premature. PGR may be leaving rate on
the table as growth is coming with less effort (expense ratio 17.3% Dec. '22 vs. 20% pre-
pandemic). Finally, there is usually a new business penalty, and it takes a few policy terms to
meet profitability hurdle rates. (In 3Q22, PGR saw total new personal auto application growth of
20% y/y). As the pendulum swings back to growth, we worry that it may be challenging for PGR
to operationally demonstrate the same restraint and turn down business when appropriate.

PGR's underlying loss ratio improved to 75.4% in Dec. from 75.7% in Nov. and 77.6% in Oct.
PGR's expense ratio fell to 17.3% in Dec. from 18.0% in Nov. and remains below pre-pandemic
levels (north of 20%). We do not think an expense ratio well below 20% (especially this month's
17.3%) is sustainable. PGR's underlying loss ratio three-month simple average of 76.5% has a
way to go to return to pre-pandemic levels (~68%). We think auto insurers will approach rate
adequacy in 2024 - to be sure, not a return to 2019 levels. Finally, on a FY22 basis, PGR achieved
its targeted combined ratio <96% as it reported a 95.8% combined ratio.

Asset Leverage: PGR continues to see more NII gains, as the duration of its assets is shorter,
leading to a quicker turnover rate, and its total investments to shareholders equity is high at
3.4x. On a capital adequacy standpoint, while auto is a less capital-intensive business than
other lines, we think PGR's high asset leverage may pressure an already constrained capital
position. PGR's premium growth levels (+15% NPW y/y) consume capital and it is generating
lower organic capital through earnings than its historical trend. PGR's pre-tax net investment
income (ex expenses) this month was $151mn vs. our $118mn estimate. Part of the boost of
PGR's NII ($21mn) was due to an accounting change.
Dec. operating EPS of $0.53 beat our $0.36 estimate, reflecting better NII and underwriting
income. We had modeled catastrophe loss of $43mn vs. PGR's $64mn.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 152.00
If PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. If PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~21x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 90.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~13x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +2.6% in Dec. (slightly below our estimate of
+2.7%), as compression in auto agency (-1.4% vs. our -1.5%) is more than offset by growth in
auto direct (+5.9% vs. our 6.0%).
As PIF declines remain more evident in agency, we expect PGR's customer mix to continue to
shift toward direct over time. To recap, direct represents 57% of personal auto PIF in Dec. '22.

Underlying loss ratio improving
PGR's underlying loss ratio improved to 75.4% in Dec. from 75.7% in Nov. and 77.6% in Oct.
PGR's expense ratio of 17.3% in Dec. has declined relative to its run rate. Collectively, PGR's
underlying combined ratio of 92.7% has improved from of 93.7% in Nov., 95.9% in Oct., and
96.2% in Sept.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
Our focus is on an absolute basis, where used car pricing remains significantly elevated (see
Figure 3). Likewise, if we compare used car & trucking pricing to Dec. '19 levels, it is up 37.7% vs.
all items at 15.5%. We pay lesser attention to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban
25 January 2023
4
Barclays | Progressive Corp.
Consumers, which rose 6.5% over the 12 months from Dec. 2021 to Dec. 2022. Used car and
truck CPI trails all items at -8.8% in Dec. vs. - 3.3% in Nov.
Manheim pricing was +0.8% m/m. We put less weight on Manheim pricing -14.9% y/y basis.
More importantly, if we compare Dec '22 to Dec.'19, Manheim pricing is still up 43%.
Compounded auto pricing during that period has not caught up - not anywhere close. There is
still significant rate catch-up needed to see that inflection point. It will be like an "x"; loss costs
go down, then pricing goes up - where the two intersect in our view can take a bit longer,
especially given how long it is taking auto pricing to actually "earn" in.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life
AIG, Inc. (AIG)
Chubb Limited (CB)
Palomar Holdings, Inc. (PLMR)
Ryan Specialty Holdings (RYAN)

Barclays | Progressive Corp.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $121 PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
