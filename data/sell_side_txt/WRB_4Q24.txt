Price Target Change - January 27, 2025
Commercial Lines Insurance
W.R. Berkley Corporation
A Berkley-esque Quarter; Q4 Earnings and Conference Call
Roundup
Our Call
WRB printed EPS of $1.13 beating us ($0.94) and street ($0.96) but the quality of the
beat was low given the tax rate / FX ($0.14 upside vs us). 2025 set up better with guide
for DD NWP growth, underlying margin improvement, and limited CA losses.
Estimates mixed, price target goes up:Our 2025 is lowered to $4.40 (from $4.45) due
to CA wildfire losses (assume $24.7m of losses / $30b industry loss based on 0.6% CA
commercial share as of 2023 YE) while 2026 is up to $5.05 (from $4.95) on a lower tax
rate, higher NII and better margins. We initiate 2027 EPS at $5.60. Our price target is $70
(from $67) based on 13.9x our 2026 EPS (we shifted our PT to be on 2026 vs 2025 prior)
and 2.4x our estimated 2026 book value (incl. AOCI) of $29.18.

Note: $ in millions except per share and where indicated
Takes for the group: (1) Pricing remains strong although it slowed to 7.7% (ex comp)
from 8.4% in the Q3 with property continuing to see pressure, (2) E&S submission flow
remains robust although momentum shifting more towards casualty vs property, (3)
social inflation continues to be a headwind with WRB pointing to casualty reinsurance
being slow in recognizing this dynamic (WRB saw casualty reinsurance NWP down 15%
given competitive environment), and (4) comp continues to see favorable trends.
Cautious on casualty re: WRB saw casualty reinsurance NWP decline 15.4% in the quarter
(NWP growth of +9.9% ex casualty reinsurance) as a result of a competitive pricing
environment which led to Berkley taking more of a defensive stance as they believe the
market is not being disciplined and achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. WRB
noted pricing takes longer to show in casualty but has longer staying power than property.
WRB still sees enough opportunities to grow double-digits in 2025.
Confident in margins: The insurance underlying loss ratio of 60.6% was up 40bps vs the
prior year with the uptick due to business mix given the contribution of casualty lines
was higher vs property (~50% of the total book of business). WRB noted they expect
underwriting profitability to improve from here (or at least not deteriorate) given their

optimism in their current book fo business (pointed to some encouraging data around
long-tail lines) and the strong aggregate rate they are achieving.
Other conference call highlights: WRB does not expect any material losses from the
CA wildfires given Berkley One (private client personal lines) does not participate in the
CA market and overall they have small commercial property exposure (0.6% commercial
share as of 2023 YE). See inside for highlights of key issues for WRB. The stock: Shares
could be flat as the earnings beat is counterbalanced by weaker premium growth, even
with a stronger 2025 outlook.

Base Case | $70.00
. Our price target of $70 is based on a
13.9x our 2026 EPS derived from a
70% / 30% weighting towards traditional
commercial players (TRV/ HIG / CB/
ACGL - 10.5x avg P/E) and specialty
players (RLI / KNSL - 21.7x avg P/E).
· Our price target translates to 2.4x our
2026 estimated BV (2.2x ex AOCI).
Upside Scenario | $81.00
.
Our $81 upside price target assumes
16.1x our 2026 EPS derived on a 50 / 50
blend between traditional commercial
players and specialty players.
· Translates to 2.8x our 2026 book value
estimate (2.6x ex AOCI).
· We assume WRB is able to see
consistent double-digit premium
growth (at the high end of 10-15% or
above), margin expansion and good
investment returns resulting in industry
leading returns.
· Assumes lack of significant adverse
reserve development.
Downside Scenario | $53.00
· Our $53 downside price target assumes
a 10.5x P/E multiple which is the average
for traditional coverage players (with no
specialty premium).
.
Translates to 1.81x our 2026 book value
estimate (1.67x ex AOCI).
. In this scenario WRB could see lower
premium growth (below the expected
10-15%), margin compression and
investments volatility.
· The downside scenario includes adverse
development on the softer market years
as well as the more recent accident
years.
Upcoming Catalysts
· Monthly pricing surveys, which will highlight the overall
strength (or lack thereof) of the commercial lines pricing
environment
· The filing of its 10-K, which should provide more color into its
GAAP triangles and movement by line / accident year.

Q4 Earnings Highlights
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q4 EPS of $1.13, beating our $0.94 and above consensus of $0.96
with a big portion of the beat driven by favorable FX ($0.10 beat vs us as we did not include FX in
our estimate), lower tax and modestly higher investment income. Cat losses came in at $79.6m (2.6
pts), in line with our $80.0m (2.7 pts). Prior year favorable reserve development was $1.6 million, in
line with our $1m of favorable development (0.0 pts) although a breakout was not provided between
insurance / reinsurance. The investment income came in modestly ahead of us ($317.4m vs our
$304.0m) as lower core portfolio income of $312.8m vs our $317.4m offset a modestly lower
investment funds loss of $12.4m (3.2% annualized loss) vs our estimate of a $28.1m loss (7.0%
annualized loss).
The underlying combined ratio of 87.7% was relatively in-line with our 87.6%; the underlying loss ratio
came in 30bps worse than us and was 40 basis points worse than the prior year quarter. The expense
ratio was 28.4%, 20 basis points better than us. WRB bought back $67.4m of shares, relative to our
$100.0m, and returned an additional $220m through dividends (included a special dividend) for a
payout ratio of 64%. The operating ROE was 21.5% (23.6% ROE on beginning of year equity), and the
net income ROE was 30.9%. Book value per share including AOCI was relatively flat sequentially at
$22.09 ($24.55 ex AOCI).

What the Companies Are Saying - WRB
Outlook
WRB was optimistic on 2025 with expectations that their underwriting margin is likely to improve
from here over time and certainly at a minimum will not deteriorate. NWP was 8% and came in below
the 10-15% guided range but WRB noted it will vary quarter to quarter and if you backed out casualty
reinsurance, growth was within the range (at around 10%). WRB was bearish on casualty reinsurance
(pointing to being in a defensive posture) as they believe the market is not exercising the discipline and
expecting an appropriate risk-adjust return. WRB noted submission flow into the E&S space continues
to be robust, and they're seeing a little less momentum on the property side and more momentum on
the casualty side. They noted there are pockets of professional that a little bit more competition on
the E&S front but overall the E&S business is growing considerably faster than their admitted business.
Pricing
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 7.7% in Q4, 70bps lower than 8.4% in Q3. WRB still sees a
tailwind for property insurance, but the tailwind is slowing. In property reinsurance / retro, there was
no tailwind to be found at 1/1 with their property cat renewal risk-adjusted returns down 15%-ish and
retro seeing similar declines.
Guidance
On the guidance side, they remained confident in achieving premium growth between 10-15%,
although they did caveat some quarters may be below or above the range (last two quarters have
been below) with the shortfall in the Q4 attributed to casualty reinsurance where they saw limited
opportunities. Away from premium growth, guidance included: (1) the expense ratio should be
comfortably below 30%, (2) the 2025 tax rate should be around 23% plus or minus, and (3) expects
underlying profitability to improve from here or at least no deteriorate from here. As for the CA
wildfire losses, WRB expects manageable losses as Berkley One (private client personal lines) does not
participate in California and overall WRB is pretty light in terms of property exposure (CA market share
overall is 0.6% for the commercial space as of 2023 YE).
Investments
Net investment income was $317.4m in Q4, below $323.8m in Q3 but beating our $304m estimate
as although the core portfolio was below us, investment fund losses (of $12.4m / 3.0% annualized
loss) was better than us. The duration of the portfolio was extended to 2.6 years, when compared to
2.4 years in Q3 and year-end 2023. The yield on the domestic portfolio was 4.6%, relative to current
domestic new money rates are 5.4% plus.
Liquidity and Capital
WRB's debt to capital ratio ended Q4 at 25.3%, similar to the end of Q3 (25.2%) but below the YE
2023 level of 27.6%. There were $67m of repurchases in the quarter / $220m of dividends (including
$190m of special dividends) after $12.5m of repurchases / $126m of dividends (including $95m of
special dividends) in the prior quarter. In the past WRB has used both share repurchase and special
dividends as a way to return excess capital ;. The company's payout ratio was 63.6% of operating
earnings, relative to 37.0% in the Q3 (included a special dividend), 91.1% in the Q2 (included a special
dividend), 10.0% in the Q1 and 77.0% in FY 2023.
WRB's call focused on growth,
margins, pricing trends,
CA wildfire implications,
investments, and expenses.
WRB's guidance included: (1)
still see opportunity to grow
double digits in 2025, (2)
expense ratio comfortably below
30%, (3) 2025 tax rate of 23%
plus or minus and (4) improving
underwriting profitability from
here (at a minimum they do not
expect to see any deterioration)

Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period
Pricing Comments
Q4 2024
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 7.7%, which was below the 8.4% in the prior quarter. WRB noted businesses' should
continue to grow at a healthy rate in excess of trend. WRB was more cautious on casualty reinsurance as the pricing
environment is competitive and they believe the market is not achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. WRB believes the
pricing environment in E&S casualty should remain resilient and strong with casualty pricing trending to be slower to reprice but
often times has more staying power (than property).
Q3 2023
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8.4%, which was up modestly from 8.3% in the prior quarter. Pricing is being led by
commercial auto followed by excess and umbrella. WRB noted the with the 8.4% pricing, the company is clearing the hurdle (of
loss cost) by a margin. On the reinsurance side, WRB said reinsurance companies are positioning themselves to achieve flat
pricing but they think it will be difficult for them to achieve that unless Milton proves to be uglier than expected.
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8.3%, which was above the 7.8% in the prior quarter. When asked about the
sequential acceleration, the company highlighted commercial auto as the leading candidate for the uptick given the line grew
almost 16%, which is being driven by higher rate. For the current year, the company noted they are building in a risk margin that
they feel is reasonably comfortable. The company highlighted that they have received 68% cumulative rate ex comp since 2019
with loss trend cumulative uptick below that. The company noted that professional liability ex D&O) is having a reasonably good
moment on both the admitted and non-admitted side while D&O continues to be challenged, specifically transactional liability is
very concerning and they are shrinking the line rapidly. WRB said there are many insurance departments not operating in a
timely manner and in some cases quite resistant to allows carriers on the commercial side to get rate increases they need which
is pushing business into the specialty and E&S market. The company pointed out that the E&S business is probably growing at
give or take 50% more than the standard market rate.
Q2 2024
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 7.8%, which was a touch below the 8.0% in the prior quarter. They said that despite
some commentary around E&S losing some momentum, they see the momentum for liability lines continuing as strong as ever
and pointed to property most likely being some of the slowing in the non-admitted market. They still think there is additional
momentum in property but it probably does not have the level of momentum it had last year. They are still seeing rate move up in
the line and expect they will continue to see it move up in the immediate future. For general liability, submission remains very
robust, both on the admitted and non-admitted side with the main driver being social inflation. They said commercial auto has
been in the cross-hairs of social inflation and they expect to see considerable firming in that line for that reason. In addition,
excess and umbrella to the extent it relates to commercial auto market. they expect to see firming there as well. In workers'
comp, they pointed to seeing signs of California rate bottoming out and think the rest of the country is probably a pace or two
behind. In D&O, their view is pricing has not bottomed yet but it is closing in on the bottom. On the reinsurance side, they believe
pricing is peaking but still view opportunity in the line as margins remain strong.
Q1 2024
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8% in Q4, a touch below 8.5% in Q3, due to business mix. Overall they view this 8%
as exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss trend. Within property cat reinsurance, WRB viewed the market at 1/1/24
as very attractive, but maybe not as attractive as at 1/1/23. Further, they highlighted that there is a distinction between property
cat and property per risk reinsurance. They also said there is a distinction with the primary property market, where they are
pushing hard on rate, and it is sticking. Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8% in Q4, a touch below 8.5% in Q3, due to

with the primary property market, where they are pushing hard on rate, and it is sticking. They spoke positively about business
continuing to go to the E&S market.
Q4 2023
WRB is very focused on social inflation and they said that you can see that in their rate increases (8.5% excluding workers'
compensation) and they intend to stay on top of it. The market has been accepting of its rate increases as shown in its steady
renewal retention of 80%. Specifically WRB is pushing very hard on rate within commercial auto and the market is accepting of it
- this led to strong growth in commercial auto in the quarter.

WRB saw rate of 8.2% (ex workers' comp), which was relatively stable with the Q1 (at 8.3%) and reflective of its business mix.
WRB said that there continues to be a bifurcation in the standard market and E&S market. Within the standard market, where
National carriers do not have an appetite to write business that is leading to opportunities on the E&S side. WRB said that
submission flow remains robust, and they are encouraged about activity over the balance of the year, and flagged good results in
July. Overall WRB's view is that the industry is struggling with the balance between rate needs and keeping up with loss trend
versus their desire to grow.
Q1 2023
Regarding property, the company noted that its disappointment in Q4 pricing discipline has improved month over month, resulting
in what is regards as real progressing being made on the pricing front in April. The company feels the rationalization of pricing in
the property market, while more pronounced on the cat side, is broad-based overall. The company called out public D&O, certain
professional liability lines, and commercial auto as being the most irrational parts of the market. Still, WRB does see pockets of
opportunities even within professional liability, especially if written on an E&S basis.
WRB said they were disappointed in the discipline in property pricing in the Q4 as they said many carriers failed to take into
account limited reinsurance capacity and higher reinsurance costs. They believe that property pricing should continue to improve
as 2023 develops. For workers' comp, they said they missed the timing on when the market would begin to harden and they
expect pricing to be bumpy in 2023 with expectation for considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given severity trends, particularly
medical inflation. For auto, they said there is rate to be had but remains the most susceptible line to social inflation and requires
thought and judgement in underwriting for loss costs. Umbrella and general liability excess are amongst the brighter opportunities
with one area on the cautious watchlist being large account excess lines. Professional liability is a tale of two stores with D&O
being pressured given the rising competitive landscape but other lines within professional liability should provide good
opportunities. WRB said they participated at 1/1 renewals and said the clock is right to lean in with good discipline with the US
offering more attractive returns than international.
Q4 2022
Q3 2022
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers'
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to see
resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth target,
which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust. In
workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity and
erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from that.
Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable momentum, up
45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing
is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back

Summary of Estimate Changes
Estimates lowered. See below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q4 2024 earnings.
. 2025 EPS is down modestly due to a higher Q1 cat load (as we bake in $24.7m of losses for the
wildfires - split evenly between insurance / reinsurance), partially offset by a lower tax rate.
. 2026 EPS is up to $5.05 (from $4.95) reflecting a lower tax rate, modestly better underlying
margins in both insurance / reinsurance and modestly higher NII.
. We initiate a 2027 EPS of $5.60 based on 18.9% operating ROE, implying 10.4% EPS growth.
Equity Research
Our 2025 is modestly lower
due to CA wildfire loss (of
$24.7m) and 2026 is up on
better underlying margins and
a lower tax rate. We introduce
a 2027 EPS of $5.60 (10% EPS
growth).

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases and
growth in 2025, which we do not believe is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $70.00 from $67.00
.
Our price target of $70 is based on a 13.9x our 2026 EPS derived from a 70% / 30% weighting towards traditional commercial players
(TRV/ HIG / CB/ ACGL - 10.5x avg P/E) and specialty players (RLI / KNSL - 21.7x avg P/E).
· Our price target translates to 2.4x our 2026 estimated BV (2.2x ex AOCI).
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe losses.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
