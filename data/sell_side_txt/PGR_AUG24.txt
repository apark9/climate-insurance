Progressive Corp.
August 2024 Results Beat on Margins
& Growth
Strong performance on both volume growth and margins.
Progressive reported strong month of August results with y/y beats across underwriting ratios
and policy in-force (PIF) growth. We view this favorably as the underwriting results and speed of
margin improvement give further momentum to PGR's ability to lean into growth. On the back
of this, PGR also produced PIF growth of 13% vs our estimate of 11.5%. The PIF beat was
particularly driven by Personal Auto which we view favorably. EPS came in at $1.59 vs our $0.93
due mainly to the favorable underwriting results relative to our estimates. This monthly result
serves as further evidence that PGR is ahead of its peers on price taking and growth, which we
think will be viewed favorably by investors.

Personal Auto Net Premiums Written grew 42%, vs 31% Barclays est. losses, and LAE of 3,197.5m
came in better than Barclays estimate of 3,614.7m. This translated to a Loss Ratio of 64.8%, vs
72.9% Barclays est, from both attritional loss ratio beat and better than expected cat load of
30bps, vs 4.7% reflected in our estimates. While expense ratio came in slightly higher (20.8% vs
19.6% Barc est), overall Combined Ratio was still materially better than our expectation (85.5%
vs 92.5%). The expense ratio will likely remain elevated, but this should be viewed favorably
given it is enabling growth.
Overall, personal auto PIF grew 14.8% y/y to 22.4bn, vs our est of 22.1bn, reflecting 13.2%
growth. Both Agency (10.8% vs 9.5% Barc Est) and Direct (17.8% vs 16.0% Barc Est) performed
better than expectations. Homeowners business also came in strong, growing 14.0% y/y to
3.4bn vs our estimate of 3.3bn and 10.7% growth.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

from a P/BV vs ROE regression and assuming PGR trades at a 57% premium to the regression line.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside Risks: The greatest upside risk is that PGR
executes on its growth strategy better than we anticipate driving top line led beat and raises. Downside Risks: We see downside risk if PGR is not able
to meet high expectations for growth or if that growth leads to more margin pressure than expected.

Russia: This material is not intended for investors who are not Qualified Investors according to the laws of the Russian Federation as it might contain
information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory
or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what constitutes, an 'ESG', 'green', 'sustainable', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment,
strategy or consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to
evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
