Price Target Change - October 19, 2021

The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
TRV: Mostly Good Read-Throughs for the Group; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 10/19 to discuss Q3 results. The call focused
on pricing, underlying trends within its businesses, and its expectations for taking price
within personal auto. Our 2021 EPS estimate rises to $12.77 (from $11.33), our 2022
estimate is now $12.25 (from $12.10), while 2023 goes to $13.05 (from $12.95),
reflecting adjustments to our investment income, premium, and margin assumptions.
We have lowered our Q4 2021 cat load, as TRV should be able to get recoveries on most
of its losses under its aggregate reinsurance cover (which has $255 million remaining).
Our price target rises to $161 (from $159) and is based on 1.28x our 2022E book value.
TRV got a lift from earnings coming in above expectations and the better-than-expected
underlying margin within Business Insurance in the quarter.
. TRV is the first P&C insurer to report leaving many tea leaves for the rest of
earnings season-including: (1) commercial lines pricing slowed (as shown within
their renewal rate within BI), which was expected, but TRV sounds as if it still expects
rate to stay on top of loss trend; (2) exposure growth was 3.6%, which was the
strongest level since Q3 2018 and is a strong sign for the insurance brokers (on top of
the good print from TFC last week); (3) within its personal auto book it saw frequency
trends return to pre-pandemic levels (and is also seeing elevated severity trends), and
will look to take rate over the next few quarters; and (4) it was a strong investment
income quarter, driven by alternative investments.
· Loss trend view mostly unchanged. Travelers has not seen a meaningful change in
the long-term normalized view of loss trend within commercial lines. Within personal
lines it is seeing a slightly increased view of long-term normalized loss trend. TRV last
moved its BI loss trend assumption (which sits at 5%) in Q2 2020; and while the RRC
now sits at 6.3%, the company alluded to some margin over loss trend (as a portion
of the RPC, which was 9.9% counts as rate). From a pricing perspective, TRV sees
inflation (social and other inflation), as well as the frequency and severity of weather
losses, helping to maintain a strong pricing environment.
· BI margin discussion. The business insurance underlying loss ratio improved by 3.8
points from last year, with two points coming from earned rate exceeding loss trend
(unchanged from Q2), and the remaining two points about evenly split between
favorable non-cat property losses and the impact of the pandemic (favorable
frequency within commercial auto). We had been looking for 90 basis points of
improvement in the BI underlying loss ratio, as we expected two points of rate versus
trend, but did not expect favorability from the pandemic (on top of the 50 basis points
the company saw last Q3).
· Personal lines pricing color. TRV did not expect to see any price increases in auto this
quarter, as it was beginning the process last quarter and had to get approval. Travelers
has 40 planned rate increases over the next few quarters, with 2-3 rate increases
likely this month and another handful before the end of the year (subject to approval
from states), with the remainder expected in H1 2022. In H2, TRV expects that it
will take rate increases on about 25-30% of its book, although this does depend on
receiving approval from regulators. TRV said that it is back to seeing frequency at pre-
pandemic levels and it is also being affected by higher severity trends (elevated vehicle
replacement and repair costs).

Commercial Lines Insurance
Equity Research
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 10/19 to discuss Q3 results. The call focused on pricing
trends (with commercial and personal lines), underlying trends within its businesses (including the
drivers of the underlying margin improvement within Business Insurance), and its expectations for
taking price within personal auto. Our 2021 EPS estimate rises to $12.77 (from $11.33), and our
2022 estimate is now $12.25 (from $12.10), while 2023 goes to $13.05 (from $12.95), reflecting
adjustments to our investment income, premium, and margin assumptions. We have lowered our
Q4 2021 cat load, as TRV should be able to get recoveries on most of its losses under its aggregate
reinsurance cover (which has $255 million remaining). Our price target rises to $161 (from $159) and
is based on 1.28x our 2022E book value and 13.1x our 2022E EPS.
The quarter in a nutshell. This morning (10/19), TRV reported Q3 core EPS of $2.60, beating both
our $1.52 estimate and the $1.83 consensus estimate. TRV beat on many items, including (1) better
underlying results within Business Insurance, due to the combination of earned rate exceeding loss
trend and a benefit from lower non-property weather losses and commercial auto frequency due to
the pandemic (the two points of rate exceeding loss trend was in line with us, whereas the other two
points from non-cat property and pandemic-related benefits a delta versus our model) and Bond &
Specialty, which more than offset weaker results within Personal Lines; (2) better reserve development
(away from an asbestos charge), driven by releases within workers' comp; (3) stronger investment
income (due to another quarter of strong returns from alternative investment income); and (4) a lower
tax rate. The underlying combined ratio of 91.4% beat our 92.5% estimate, with Business Insurance
and Bond & Specialty beating us, while Personal Lines missed us. NPW rose by 7.1%, just beating our
6.9% estimate. NII was $771 million, better than our $675 million estimate, with the upside due to
other investments. Cats were $501 million, lower than our $525 million estimate (cat and non-cat
weather benefited from $95 million of recoveries under its aggregate reinsurance cover), as TRV saw
lower hurricane losses than its market share implies as it pulled back from writing business along the
coast in Louisiana. Repurchases were $601 million, ahead of our $350 million estimate. The tax rate
was 15.8%, lower than our 16.5% estimate. Book value per share declined by 1.0% and the core ROE
was 10.1%.

2021 and 2022 Outlook
2021 outlook unchanged; initial investment income guide for 2022 provided. Exhibit 2 below
highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2021. TRV did not provide specific 2021 guidance,
which is consistent with previous quarters in 2020 after TRV pulled its outlook in Q1 2020 for renewal
premium change and its underlying margins as a result of the uncertainty associated with the potential
impacts associated with Covid-19. TRV did provide an outlook for net investment income, and also
provided helpful color around other line items in the model. TRV continues to expect Q4 2021 fixed
income NII to be in the $425-435 million range on an after-tax basis and the initial quarterly guide
for 2022 is $420-430 million per quarter. On the alternative investment income side, TRV said that
the results have been unusually strong and that most likely will not continue. For catastrophe losses,
TRV highlighted that as of Q3, it has incurred $95 million of recoveries under its aggregate reinsurance
cover, leaving $255 million of recoveries in the Q4 (depending on the level of qualifying losses). In
Business Insurance, TRV saw 2 points from the combination of the favorable impact of the pandemic
(favorable frequency trends within commercial auto) and non-cat weather. Within BI, rate exceeded
loss trend by around 2 points in the quarter, stable with the Q2, and compared to a little less than 2
points in Q1 and over 1.5 points in Q4 2020. Bond and Specialty did not lay out specific guidance
for the year (with Q4 2020 earnings, TRV said it expected the underlying margin to be better than
the 87% in H2 2020 during 2021). Personal lines results were affected by auto frequency returning
to pre-pandemic levels and elevated severity in auto and property, due to higher costs of labor and
materials. The expense ratio was 29.4%, which was in line with last Q3 and also in line with TRV's
expectations.

Takeaways for the Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us and the laterals for the rest of the group are below. Net-
net, the biggest takes are that TRV pointed to pricing remaining strong within commercial lines and
that personal auto is being affected by frequency trends that are at pre-pandemic levels and elevated
severity (as vehicle replacement and repair costs remain at high levels; see our most recent CPI note).
Highlights of the laterals that we see for the group follow below:
1. Commercial lines pricing remains strong, but is decelerating, with renewal rates up 6.3% in Business
Insurance, down from 7.1% in Q2 and rates that were around 8% in the three previous quarter. TRV
is still getting positive rates in all lines, except workers' comp, with the strongest rates in excess
casualty, umbrella, auto, and then property. Rates staying above loss trend is a positive for the
commercial insurers (AIG, CB, HIG, and WRB) and specifically, AIG and CB, where workers' comp
represent a smaller portion of their book, in our view.
2. Underlying margin in Business Insurance benefited from rate exceeding trend, and the favorable impact
of non-cat property losses and the pandemic. TRV said that earned rate exceeded loss trend by
around 2 points, which is in line with the Q2. This would be a positive as well for the commercial
lines insurers, including AIG, CB, HIG, and WRB.
3. Strong exposure growth. Exposure growth was 3.6%, which is higher than the 2.9% in Q2, and
is a bullish sign for the insurance brokers. This adds to the strong lateral we already have from
the strong organic growth quarter from Truist. This appears to be a good sign for all insurance
brokers-given that TRV is more of a small-middle market insurer, it is the best take for AJG and
BRO, but does point to a strong quarter for the group in general.
4. No Covid-19 direct losses were called out. This was the case last quarter as well, and ties to our
overall thought that Covid-19 related losses have largely subsided for the P&C sector. Travelers
did not see direct losses, but did see favorable frequency trends within commercial auto (which
benefited Business Insurance results by 1 point in the quarter). We do not expect to see many, if
any, Covid-19 losses from P&C insurers in Q3.
5. Personal auto frequency trends are back to pre-pandemic levels. TRV's Personal Auto book was
affected by frequency trends returning to pre-pandemic levels. The Personal Auto segment's
underlying margin came in at 97.0%, which was the worst quarter since Q4 2019. Furthermore,
the weaker auto results at TRV show that this is not just a non-standard issue (PGR, which saw
weaker margins throughout the quarter, skews more non-standard than others) and points to a
weak quarter for the group (including ALL). In general, we remain cautious on the personal auto
insurers (ALL, $126.58, Equal Weight) (PGR, $92.39, Underweight), due to the lack of pricing in
the market and elevated/frequency and severity trends. TRV is looking to take rate in personal
auto over the next few quarters, and we expect the company to provide an update on rating level
and the regulatory process next quarter.
6. Net investment income guide unchanged. TRV did not change its investment income guide for fixed
investment income of $425-435 million after-tax in Q4, as the benefit from higher invested assets
is offset by a decline in yields. The company also provided an initial guide for 2022 for fixed income
investment income of $420-430 million after-tax on a quarterly basis, which is only modestly lower
than the Q4 guide. This is a good lateral for most (if not all) insurers, in our view.
7. Strong alternative investment quarter. Alternative-related investment income totaled $281 million in
Q3, down from $335 million in Q2, but well above our $190 million estimate. We think alternative-
related investment income could surprise to the upside, for both P&C and life insurers, based on
TRV's strong results.
8. Repurchases picked up in Q3. TRV repurchased $601 million in Q3, higher than $401 million in Q2,
and exceeding our $350 million estimate. We expect most insurers, P&C and life, to pick up their
level of buyback activity in the Q3, especially given the attractive valuations across both the
P&C and life insurance sectors. The only exception could be reinsurers (i.e., RNR) that have a
higher exposure to the Q3 cat losses.

Highlights of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of our estimate changes. Exhibit 3 highlights the changes we made to our earnings
model following Q2 2021 earnings. Our 2021 EPS estimate rises to $12.77 (from $11.33), our
2022 estimate is now $12.25 (from $12.10), while 2023 goes to $13.05 (from $12.95), reflecting
adjustments to our investment income, premium, and margin assumptions. We have lowered our
Q4 2021 cat load, as TRV should be able to get recoveries on most of its losses under its aggregate
reinsurance cover (which has $255 million remaining). Our price target rises to $161 (from $159).

Commercial Lines Insurance
Pricing Accelerating in Commercial Lines
Business Insurance Rating Environment-TRV Rates Taper Down, but Still Above Loss Trend
Equity Research
· In Q3, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +6.3%, below +7.1% in Q2 2021, +8.1%
(revised lower) in Q1, +8.2% in Q4 2020 (revised up), and +8.0% (revised lower) in Q3 2020.
Exposure growth was +3.6% versus +2.9% in Q2 2021 (revised up from 2.4%), +1.3% in Q1 (revised
up from 1.2%), -0.3% in the Q4 2020, and -0.2% in Q3 2020. See Exhibits 4 and 5 below, which
show the recent trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal rate change.
Travelers, for its part, seemed positive on the forward pricing outlook and did highlight that some
part of the RPC does act as rate.
· TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC (last summer), as the company was unsure of
how the economy would be affected by Covid-19. The company has yet to bring back RPC forward
guidance, but has pointed to margin improvement, as Business Insurance earned rate remains in
excess of loss trend. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains positive in Q4,
although maybe not as strong as in the past two quarters.

Personal Lines-TRV Pointed to Looking to Take Price in Auto and Home
· Within Personal Insurance, TRV saw a further deceleration in rate in personal auto in the quarter, as
it has only recently started pushing for price. The RPC in auto was -0.1% in Q3 (TRV did not expect
to see price come through in the Q3), versus 0.2% in Q2, 0.5% in the Q1, 0.9% in Q4, and 1.6% in
Q3 2020. On the auto side, TRV said that auto driving frequency returned to pre-pandemic levels,
in line with expectations, and that it is incorporating that into its pricing actions and it is looking to
take price in both Q4 2021 and H1 2022.
· Homeowners' pricing accelerated to 8.8% in the Q3, compared to 8.2% in Q2, 7.6% in Q1, 8.2% in
Q4, and 8.1% in Q3 2020. On the home side, TRV said it will look to take price in response to the
high level of fire and non-cat weather losses it is seeing.
· Travelers' new business in auto remained roughly flat sequentially, but was up when compared to
last year, with auto new business premiums totaling $297 million, versus $299 million in Q2, $278
million in Q1, $269 million in Q4, and $276 million in Q3 2020. New business was also up in home
in the quarter, growing to $312 million from $298 million last Q3.

Profitability Benefited from Better Underlying Results and Higher PYD Away
from Asbestos
Underlying Results Came in Better than Expected
· The consolidated combined ratio was 98.6%, beating our 101.3% estimate, largely reflective of a
higher level of favorable reserve development (away from the asbestos reserve strengthening)
and better underlying results. Cats of $501 million were better than our $525 million estimate,
while adverse reserve development of $56 million was significantly better than our estimate for
adverse development $155 million, due to better-than-expected PYD across all segments. The
underlying combined ratio of 91.4% was favorable to our estimate of 92.5%, and in line with last
year. Underlying results beat us in Bond & Specialty (due to a better expense ratio) and Business
Insurance (which benefited from rate exceeding loss trend and a combination of favorable impact
associated with the pandemic and lower level of property losses), while Personal Lines was below
us due to weaker results in both auto and home. Within auto, the underlying combined ratio
rose by just over 15 points in the quarter, with three-quarters of the increase due to frequency
returning to pre-pandemic levels, and the remainder due to increase severity trends (i.e., repair and
replacement costs going up).
· Catastrophe losses totaled $501 million and came in just below our $525 million estimate. TRV
noted that $425 million of the $501 came from Hurricane Ida, with the rest coming from other
severe storms. Assuming the industry loss of $30 billion for Ida, that would give Travelers a market
share of about 1.4%, which is below its average hurricane share of 2.6%.
· Travelers recognized a benefit of $95 million provided from its aggregate reinsurance cover (due to
TRV's cat definition, some losses count toward the aggregate retention that the company does not
consider cat, with $83 million benefiting cats and $12 million non-cats). The company has $255
million of recoveries left under the aggregate cover, depending on the level of qualifying losses in
Q4.
· Adverse reserve development was $56 million, better than our estimate for adverse development
of $155 million, due to a better level in all segments. Business Insurance saw unfavorable
development of $108 million (better than our estimate for $180 million of adverse development),
as increases for asbestos ($225 million) were partially offset by releases in workers' comp ($117
million) for multiple accident years. Bond & Specialty saw a release of $24 million (better than our
estimate for no development), due to better-than-expected loss experience in the fidelity and
surety product lines, and Personal Lines saw a favorable release of $30 million (higher than our $25
million), due to better-than-expected releases in homeowners.

. Net investment income was $771 million pre-tax, better than our $675 million estimate. Travelers'
after-tax book yield on its investment portfolio was 3.0%, slightly below the 3.3% yield in Q2 2021.
Fixed income investments added $497 million pre-tax, in line with our $493 million estimate, while
alts were $281 million, higher than our $190 million estimate and benefited from higher private
equity returns. Short-term investments added $2 million, below our $3 million estimate.
. TRV still expects 2021 fixed income net investment income to be in the $425-435 million range in
Q4 (per its 10Q) and provided an initial view for its quarterly fixed income NII for 2022 to be within
a range of $420-430 million.
Capital Management
. TRV repurchased $601 million for 3.8 million shares in Q3, better than our estimate for $350
million of share repurchases and higher than the $401 million last quarter. Dividends were $220
million, bringing total capital return to $821 million, compared to the $655 million of core
earnings. Total capital return to shareholders was 125.3% of core earnings in Q3 2021, and we are
currently forecasting 82.8% and 79.5% in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Premium Growth Benefited from Exposure Growth
· Net premiums written rose 7.1%, just above our 6.9% estimate, but decelerating from the +10.7%
in Q2 2021.Results were ahead of us in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty, but missed us
in Personal Lines. Gross premiums written growth of 7.7% was ahead of our 6.0% estimate, but
dropped off the 10.9% last quarter.
· Business insurance net premiums written were up 4.9% (second straight positive growth quarter
after four straight negative growth quarters), beating our +4.6% estimate, but slightly down from
the +5.4% in the Q2. Bond & Specialty net premiums written were +18.6%, smashing our +7.7%
estimate and beating the elevated +16.3% last quarter. Personal Insurance net premiums written
were +7.1%, missing our +9.5% estimate and well below the +16.4% last quarter. Within Personal
Insurance, auto net premiums written of +2.9% missed our +7.2% estimate and are well below the
+21.4% last quarter, although this growth would have been a more modest +4.2% when accounting
for the personal auto rebates last Q2, while home net premiums written growth of +11.3% was
below our +11.8% estimate and slightly down from the +12.2% last quarter.

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for ALL: $132.00
Our price target of $132 represents around a 1.4x multiple on our 2022 book value per share estimate of approximately $95.
Risk for ALL
Risks to achieving the price target include large cat losses, regulatory constraints in key states (including around getting rate increases
approved), reserve strengthening, irrational competition in personal lines, and deterioration in loss cost trends. Risks to the upside include
margins continuing to see benefits from low frequency, the elevated severity trends abating, and policy and premium growth coming in
above expectations.
Price Target for PGR: $87.00
Our $87 price target is based on (1) about a 2.45x multiple of our 2022 GAAP book value estimate of around $35.50 per share and (2) just
above 17.5x our 2022 EPS estimate.
Risk for PGR
Risks to the upside include continued favorable frequency trends, an improvement in severity trends, and stronger-than-anticipated
premium and policy growth.
Price Target for TRV: $161.00 from $159.00
Our price target of $161 is based on around a ~1.28x multiple of our projected 2022 book value estimate of around $126 and 13.1x our
2022 EPS estimate of $12.25.
Risk for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.
Investment Thesis
ALL
We believe the ALL shares are fairly valued as the company most likely has seen its margins peak and the company should be impacted by
both elevated severity trends and a spike in frequency as driving picks up. As margins are constrained by the higher loss trends, we believe
valuation expansion from here will be limited and rate the shares Equal Weight as a result.
PGR
We have an Underweight rating on the shares. As Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out and driving picks up, frequency should revert back to
more normalized levels, which combined with elevated severity trends, should cause pressure margins for PGR over the remainder of 2021
and into 2022, in our view. Further, PGR's policy growth should slow as there is less shopping in the market as most players advertise less
and look to lower top-line growth in response to the higher loss trend. The combination of weaker margins and slowing top-line growth
should cause the PGR shares to underperform the insurance sector.
TRV
We believe that TRV will benefit from one of the hardest commercial pricing environment since 2003. Although we are positive on the
commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers due to its smaller account exposure and higher workers'
comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation, lower
reserve releases, and Covid-19, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral
and rate its shares Equal Weight as a result.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities and Structured
Asset Investors, LLC ("SAI"), an investment adviser subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co. If you are paying directly for this research, it is being provided by SAI. For all other
recipients in the U.S. this report is being provided by Wells Fargo Securities.
Wells Fargo Securities' research department may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject
companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject
company's common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on
a subject company's common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the
subject company's common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental
investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary
to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to
maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual
investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in Wells Fargo
Securities research reports.
