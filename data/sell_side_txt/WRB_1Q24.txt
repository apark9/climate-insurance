WRB: Q1 Beats on Investment Income and Cats
Our Call
WRB reported Q1 EPS of $1.56, beating our $1.42 and consensus $1.43 due to
investment income and lower cats. The underlying combined ratio was in-line (expense
ratio a touch better/loss ratio a touch worse) as WRB takes a prudent view of loss trends.
Initial Thoughts
The good: Net premiums written rose 10.7%, a bit below our 13.2%, but within the
10-15% guided range for the year. Insurance rose 11.9% (vs. our 13.7%) and reinsurance
rose 4.2% (vs our 10.3%). The expense ratio was 28.6%, beating our 28.7% and better than
28.8% last Q1, whereas the underlying loss ratio of 59.1%, fell short of our 58.9% and rose
also when compared to 58.9% last Q1. Cat losses of $30.5m, were below our $40.0m.
Average rate increases ex comp were 7.8%, a touch below 8.0% in Q4.
The bad: Net investment income was $319.8m from the core portfolio, ahead of our
$292.8m. Core portfolio income of $331.2m, beat our $297.6m whereas investment
funds saw a loss of $29.3m (which was worse than our estimate for a loss of $20.3m) and
arbitrage trading account added $18.0m (beating our $15.5m). The core portfolio most
likely benefited from investment income from securities linked to Argentinian inflation
(which was also the case in Q4).
The ugly: There wasn't a lot to call "ugly" but WRB saw a loss from investment funds,
which we expected. Also, they continue to conservatively book the current accident
year and assuming no reserve development in either segment the underlying loss ratios
missed us in insurance (60.7% vs our 59.9%), but beat in reinsurance (49.0% vs our 51.5%).
Reinsurance growth was only 4.2% as growth in monoline excess and property, offset a
casualty decline (-10.1%). The tax rate of 22.9%, was above our 21%.
Negligible overall reserve movement: Reserve development was negligible as the delta
between the reported and current accident year combined ratio was the $30.5m, or 1.1
points of cat losses. We expect a focus of the conference call to be on movements WRB
has seen it its reserves for different lines and accident years during the quarter.
Stock call: The shares should trade based on the commentary given on the conference
call and any forward outlook they provided for the year. The biggest focus of the call will
be on the outlook for growth and margins and color on the reserve movement in the
quarter. Conference call at 9:00 AM EST; Dial-in number is 888-330-3391, Passcode:
9890223.

Equity Research
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q1 EPS of $1.56, beating our $1.42 and consensus of $1.43. The upside
was due to higher investment income (higher core portfolio income offsetting modestly lower
investment funds) and modestly lower cats. Catastrophe losses came in at $30.5 million (1.1 pts),
lower than our $40 million (1.4 pts). Prior year reserve development was negligible in the quarter.
WRB does not call out the level of prior year development by segment until the 10-Q. Investment
income came in at $319.8 million, better than our $292.8 million estimate, with the core portfolio and
arbitrage trading account coming in ahead of us while investment funds saw a loss of $29m which was
a bit worse than our loss of $20m estimate. There were FX gains of $13 million that helped earnings by
$0.04 per share.
The underlying combined ratio of 87.7% was in line with our 87.7%; the underlying loss ratio came
in 59.1%, ~20bps worse than our estimate while the expense ratio was 10bps better than us. The
expense ratio was 28.6%, 10 basis points better than us. WRB did not buy back any shares in the
quarter, relative to our $50 million estimate. The average diluted share count of 270.5 million was a bit
higher than our 270.2 million estimate. The reported operating ROE was 22.7%, and the reported net
income ROE was 23.7%. Book value per share grew by 4.4% sequentially to $30.34.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases in
2024, particularly as they lean in on property insurance and reinsurance, which should translate into a good level of premium growth, which
we do not believe is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $99.00 from NC
. Our price target of $99 is based on just around a 2.5x multiple of our year-end 2025 book value estimate
Â· Our price target also represents a ~14.5x multiple against our 2025 EPS estimate.
. The 14.5x is a slight discount to where WRB has historically traded as we look to be conservative given social inflation.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe losses.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
