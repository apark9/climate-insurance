Arch Capital
Momentum in MI and Reinsurance Drove Healthy
Results
Arch's results exceeded expectations, as upside in the reinsurance and
mortgage insurance business offset a shortfall in insurance. We maintain an
upbeat long-term outlook for ACGL, but are Neutral on the stock due to concerns
about downside risk to consensus EPS estimates and current valuation.
. EPS upside; cutting 1Q25 forecasts for LA fires, maintaining 2Q25 and
beyond. ACGL announced 4Q24 operating EPS of $2.26, above our $1.85
estimate and consensus of $1.80. Compared with our model, part of the beat
was due to lower cat losses (+$0.10 per share variance after taxes), more
favorable P&C development (+$0.02), and a lower tax rate (+$0.07), but
earnings would have exceeded estimates even adjusted for these items, which
tend to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We are cutting our 1Q25 EPS estimates
from $2.41 to $1.52, but are maintaining our forecasts for future periods.
· Business fundamentals were strong overall, except in the insurance
division. Mortgage insurance margins were robust (CR 13.4% versus our
17.9% assumption), helped by reserve releases, consistent with the trend in
recent periods. Reinsurance margins were strong as well (CR 83.0% vs.
91.3%E), marked by lower attritional and cat losses. Conversely, insurance
division margins were pressured by an uptick in attritional and cat losses,
which drove weaker margins on both a reported basis (CR 98.5% vs. 93.1%E)
and core (CR ex. cats and PYD 90.3% vs. 89.0%E). Insurance division reserve
development was positive, but less so than in previous periods. However,
management indicated that there were no major shifts in casualty reserves.
Arch deployed $24 million for share repurchases in the quarter (our model
assumed none) and management could continue buybacks if the stock stays
close to the current level.
· Our model projects ACGL to report strong results in the near term, but
our long-term view of the reinsurance market is mixed. We forecast Arch
to report strong underwriting margins, and healthy top-line growth in its
reinsurance and insurance businesses. Reinsurance margins should benefit
from elevated reinsurance prices and favorable terms (higher attachment
points, lack of aggregate covers). In mortgage insurance, top-line growth is
likely to be weak, but we expect high home prices and the strong labor market
to drive robust margins. On the other hand, despite our near-term optimism, we
do not project margins in the reinsurance or MI businesses to sustain at recent
levels in the long run.
. We reiterate our Neutral rating. In our view, Arch is a top-tier franchise, but
in commoditized markets. Near term, tight reinsurance terms and the favorable
housing and labor market environment should drive strong results in both the
reinsurance and MI businesses. Still, we do not expect the company's margins
and ROE to sustain at recent levels in the long run. The stock's valuation seems
more reasonable following the pullback in late 2024, but it is still not too
enticing given ACGL's long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We affirm our Neutral rating. Arch is a leading commercial
re/insurance underwriter that should produce superior and less
volatile underwriting margins compared to peers. In
reinsurance, near-term results should benefit from the firm
pricing environment and tight terms/conditions. Margins in the
MI business should remain healthy in the near-term as well, but
we expect the benefit from reserve releases to moderate
compared to recent years. Meanwhile, our long-term outlook for
the reinsurance market remains cautious, and we expect pricing
to deteriorate further if margins remain close to recent levels.
This, along with optimistic investor sentiment and concerns
about downside risk to consensus estimates keep us Neutral on
ACGL.

We are Neutral on Arch, but our overall view is relatively upbeat and we consider
it an attractive stock for those seeking exposure to the firm reinsurance market.
Arch is a premier re/insurance underwriter with a unique culture and approach to risk
management that should generate superior, and less volatile, margins over time. The
company also has a leading mortgage insurance franchise, a business that we view as
structurally superior to P&C reinsurance. In primary P&C, Arch has expanded its
position in wholesale/E&S through the current hard market and the acquisition of
MidCorp should add scale and distribution to its middle market franchise. Our near term
outlook for Arch is positive, and we forecast its results to benefit from tight terms/
conditions in the reinsurance market as well as continued reserve releases in mortgage
insurance. However, our longer term outlook is more muted, and we expect reinsurance
prices to soften over the next 1-2 years if underwriting margins remain close to recent
levels. The reinsurance market is plagued by structural issues such as low barriers to
entry, lack of differentiation among carriers, and limited pricing power, all of which
suggest greater competition if margins remain near recent levels. Also, investor
sentiment on ACGL is bullish, and we feel that the stock's valuation is not particularly
enticing. Still, our fundamental outlook for the company remains constructive and we
could become more bullish if the stock pulls back.
P&C Reinsurance: Near-Term View Positive; L-T Cautious
Our model projects disciplined pricing and terms to drive robust margins in the
reinsurance business over the next year. ACGL has historically generated better and
less volatile margins than reinsurance peers due to its focus on specialty business (where
pricing is less competitive), conservative underwriting, ability to shift mix with
changing conditions, and judicious management of catastrophe risk. Also, ACGL prices
business using the risk-free rate (leading to conservative pricing), incentivizes
underwriters with a long-term compensation plan based on margins over multiple years,
and diversifies re/insurance underwriting income with fees from 3rd party capital
vehicles such as Premia. Still, we are cautious on long-term trends in the
reinsurance market because of its commoditized nature, the ease of entry of new
capital, and a broad set of capital providers (including some, such as pension funds, with
lower return thresholds). We are skeptical of a prolonged hard market and feel that
strong margins in recent years will likely erode pricing discipline. As such, we expect a
softening of pricing and terms over the next 1-2 years, especially in higher reinsurance
layers, where more capital is forming. Any signs of softening of terms/conditions or
new capacity will likely hurt sentiment on reinsurance stocks, which are well-liked.
MI: Margins to Normalize Lower, Growth Weak
ACGL expanded its position in mortgage insurance via acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and
United Guaranty in 2016) when market conditions were favorable, marked by rising
home prices, tight lending standards, and disciplined pricing by MI carriers. Arch's MI
business has reported healthy margins since then and, despite the temporary setback
from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have been strong. We expect MI
margins to be strong in the near-term, but normalize over time as reserve releases
moderate. Results in the next few quarters should benefit from ACGL's conservative
loss picks post-COVID, the strong labor market, and the increase in house prices.
Meanwhile, higher rates are likely to continue suppressing new sales.

4Q24 Details
This evening, Arch announced fourth quarter 2024 operating EPS of $2.26, above our
$1.85 estimate and consensus of $1.80. Part of the upside to our model was driven by
lower cat losses (+$0.10 per share variance after taxes), more favorable P&C
development (+$0.02), and a lower tax rate (+$0.07). Still, earnings would have
exceeded estimates even adjusted for these items, which tend to fluctuate on a quarterly
basis, as strong results in the mortgage insurance and reinsurance divisions offset a
shortfall in insurance.

Business fundamentals were healthy overall. Mortgage insurance margins were
robust (CR 13.4% versus our 17.9% assumption), helped by reserve releases, consistent
with the trend in recent periods. Reinsurance margins were strong as well (CR 83.0%
vs. 91.3%E), marked by lower attritional and cat losses. Conversely, insurance division
margins were pressured by an uptick in attritional and cat losses, which drove weaker
margins on both a reported basis (CR 98.5% vs. 93.1%E) and core (CR ex. cats and
PYD 90.3% vs. 89.0%E). Arch deployed $24 million for share repurchases in the
quarter (our model assumed none).

Mortgage Ins .: Margins Strong, Gross Premium Growth Weak
We expect mortgage insurance (MI) premiums to decline at a low-single-digit pace
and margins to gradually compress as reserve releases moderate. Although the
absolute level of MI earnings should stay healthy, we project margins to decline as
reserve releases moderate. Also, higher interest rates are likely to continue to weigh on
new business. On a positive note, the cancelation of the Bellemeade transactions and
higher interest rates should boost retention, partially offseting lower sales.
In 4Q24, the MI business posted underwriting income of $267 million, well above our
$227 million estimate, due to better margins (CR 13.4% vs. 17.9%E) and higher earned
premium growth (+11.3% vs. - 0.5%E). Most of the upside in margins was driven by
lower attritional claims (16.4% vs. 23.0%E) as reserve releases were only modestly
better than expected (-22.3% vs. - 22.0%E) and the expense ratio was worse (19.3% vs.
16.9%E). Management attributed the reserve releases to better than expected cure rates
and the higher expense ratio to lower ceding commissions as well as the costs of a one-
time voluntary separation program. Gross premiums were weak (13th consecutive
quarter of decline), but net written and net earned premium growth benefited from the
termination of the Bellemeade agreements in 4Q23. Overall, we expect the positive
drivers of MI margins (higher interest rates, lower inventory of houses, etc.) to suppress
gross premium growth through 2025.

During COVID (2020 and early 2021), MI margins were hurt by artificially high
delinquencies as homeowners took advantage of government forbearance programs.
However, since the initial spike in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has been
steadily declining . Since the expiry of forbearance programs, a significant portion of
previously delinquent loans have cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were
taking advantage of the mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial distress. In
addition, rising house prices have provided a cushion to homeowners under stress who
are struggling to pay their mortgages, limiting losses for MI carriers. The percent of
loans in default in the U.S. primary MI business was 2.09% at 12/31/2024, up from
1.96% at 9/30/2024 and 1.74% at 12/31/23.

In our view, reserve releases will continue to lift MI margins, but the tailwind
should moderate over time. Higher reported delinquencies at the onset of COVID led
Arch and its MI peers to establish conservative reserves despite the healthy labor market
and appreciation in house prices. A significant portion of these delinquencies
represented homeowners availing themselves of the government's forbearance
protection programs (to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship. As such, actual
losses have come in well below those suggested by initial delinquencies, allowing
ACGL to release reserves. In recent quarters, the vast majority of MI reserve releases
have been from post-COVID accident years. Even with likely moderation, however, we
forecast MI margins to remain robust due to the strong labor and housing markets, cures
on previously delinquent loans, and the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due
to the appreciation in house prices. Higher interest rates are a positive for margins as
well, as they are causing homeowners to stay longer in their existing houses (where they
have more equity), thereby improving persistency. Meanwhile, top-line growth in the
MI business is likely to stay weak as higher interest rates reduce mortgage originations.
Although a weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead to higher mortgage
defaults, a material uptick in losses seems unlikely in the near term. Barring a recession,
we expect core margins to stay healthy, though declining reserve releases will drive
margins and earnings lower even if economic trends remain favorable.

ACGL has been an active acquirer of MI businesses in the past, but we do not
anticipate deals in the near term. Arch has become a leading franchise in the
mortgage re/insurance since its entry to the market in 2011. The company was only
marginally involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through
credit unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. ACGL's
2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger
foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P)
and gained distribution in the bank channel. Following the deal, ACGL became a top 10
competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch further solidified its market position
with its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which moved it into the
top-3 by market share (as part of the deal AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance
blocks originated by UGC pre 2017). Arch has also expanded in foreign MI markets
through M&A, including its acquisition of Westpac's mortgage insurance business in
Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Higher Cats and AY Loss Picks Drove Miss
The insurance business reported weak results, marked by a shortfall in margins
but strong premium growth. The insurance division reported underwriting income of
$30 million in 4Q24, well short our $113 million estimate. Margins were worse than our
estimates on both a reported (CR 98.5% vs. 93.1%E) and a core basis (CR ex. cats and
PYD 90.3% vs. 89.0%E). The loss ratio increased (66.3% vs. 61.1%E) due to higher
catastrophe losses (8.3% vs. 4.5%E) and attritional losses (58.1% vs. 57.0%E) as well as
lower reserve releases (-0.1% vs. - 0.4%E). Also, expenses were slightly higher than
assumed as well (32.2% vs. 32.0%E). Moreover, catastrophe losses in the primary
insurance division were high, which the company attributed partly to inland flooding
caused by Helene as well as the addition of the MidCorp book. Meanwhile, top-line
growth was better, with upside in gross written premium growth (+28.4% vs. +23.4%E),
net written premium growth (+34.9% vs. +26.8%E), and net earned premium growth
(+33.4% vs. +13.3%E). Besides the addition of the MidCorp business, management
cited growth in short-tail and liability-occurrence lines as drivers of premium growth.
Management called out the addition of the MidCorp portfolio, increases in accident year
loss picks, and a shift in business mix towards casualty as the drivers of the higher loss
ratio. The expense ratio benefited by 2.9 points from acquisition accounting (acquisition
expense on the MidCorp block, a component of the expense ratio, was replaced with
purchase intangibles, the amortization of which is reflected in the consolidated income
statement, but not in the combined ratio).

Arch's primary P&C business is benefiting from healthy commercial lines pricing,
but we believe margins are likely to deteriorate in the near term. After shrinking its
"cycle managed" business (now called wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to 2017,
ACGL is deploying capital in this part of its primary book due to favorable conditions in
the broader market, particularly in E&S. Results in less cyclical parts of ACGL's
primary business (specialty small/middle market and franchise) have been healthy as
well. Despite the favorable market environment, we do not anticipate a material
improvement in primary commercial lines margins at Arch and peers because of
headwinds from adverse development of casualty reserves as well as higher inflation
and reinsurance costs. Also, pricing has deteriorated in certain lines (particularly in
property), and reserve development could become less of a tailwind because of adverse
loss trends emerging in older accident years. Management teams at insurance
underwriters as well as many investors are optimistic about improving non-cat margins
at commercial insurers. However, we feel that assessing results on an underlying basis is
not as relevant given the significant increase in reinsurance retentions at primary
carriers. In our view, consensus EPS forecasts for commercial lines insurers do not fully
reflect the shift in cat loads from reinsurers to primary carriers following the uptick in
retention levels with 2023 reinsurance renewals.
Reinsurance: Robust Margins Lifted Earnings
ACGL's reinsurance business reported robust results, as lower cat losses and more
favorable PYD offset a modest shortfall in premiums. Underwriting income of $328
million was well above our $168 million estimate, primarily due to higher margins (CR
83.0% vs. 91.3%E). The upside in margins was driven by lower catastrophe losses
(12.2% vs. 17.0%E) and, to a lesser extent, better reserve releases (-4.0% vs. - 3.2%E).
Underlying margins were better as well (CR ex. cats and PYD 74.8% vs. 77.5%E) due
to upside in the attritional loss ratio (50.7% vs. 53.0%E) and expense ratio (24.1% vs.
24.5%E). Meanwhile, premium growth was below our assumption (gross written
premiums -1.5% vs. +22.0%E, net written premiums +2.0% vs. 25.1%E, net earned
premiums +17.5% vs. 19.3%E). The tightening of terms and conditions at 2023
renewals shifted the risk of cat losses from reinsurers to primary carriers, and

management indicated that terms remained consistent with 2025 renewals. Arch expects
to incur losses of $450-550 million related to the LA wildfires, assuming industry wide
insured losses between $35 and $45 billion, and management believes that the
likelihood of industry wide insured losses from the event reaching $50 billion (as
highlighted by some peers) is very low.

We are skeptical of a prolonged hard reinsurance market, but recent catastrophes
bode well for market discipline and ACGL seems better positioned than peers.
ACGL's reinsurance segment was initially established to take advantage of the hard
market for casualty coverage in the early 2000s. Over the years, however, management
has increased Arch Re's exposure to other specialty lines including surety, accident and
health, agriculture, and trade credit, which are generally less competitive and have more
attractive risk-reward. The hard pricing environment has boosted results in recent years
and has led management to increase exposure to property coverages, which in turn has
contributed to strong premium growth and margins. Longer term, however, we expect
reinsurance pricing to deteriorate. Factors that contributed to a multi-year soft market
prior to 2018 (glut of capital, greater fluidity/speed of capital, more providers of
capacity, broker consolidation) are still prevalent, and should preclude prolonged hard
pricing. On a positive note, ACGL's reinsurance results could benefit from the release of
COVID-related reserves, a portion of which remain in IBNR. Similarly, loss reserves for
Ian and other cat events could ultimately prove to be too conservative.

Cutting 1Q25 EPS Estimate
We are reducing our 1Q25 operating EPS estimates from $2.41 to $1.52 and our
2025 projection from $8.69 to $7.80, respectively, for the LA wildfires. Meanwhile,
our projections for quarters beyond 1Q25 are unchanged. Our estimates for 2025 and
beyond are below consensus levels, which we feel are optimistic. We consider
catastrophe losses (which would affect reinsurance and insurance margins) and housing
market conditions (which affect MI margins and premium growth) the key sources of
potential upside or downside in reported results versus our projections.

Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $106.00)
Investment Thesis
Arch is a superior re/insurance underwriter, but bullish investor sentiment and
optimistic consensus estimates keep us from being more constructive on the stock. In
our view, ACGL's leading reinsurance business will report higher and less volatile
underwriting margins over time given its unique culture and approach to underwriting. The
reinsurance business should benefit from firm pricing and tight terms/conditions in the near
term, but our long-term outlook for the market is downbeat. We believe that structural issues
such as low barriers to entry, lack of differentiation by carrier, and limited pricing power will
drive a softening of reinsurance prices over the next one to two years. Meanwhile, Arch is
a top competitor in mortgage insurance (MI), which we believe is a structurally better
business than P&C reinsurance. We expect MI results to be marked by strong margins in the
near term, but we expect reserve releases to moderate from recent years and premium
growth to remain weak. Also, investor sentiment on ACGL is bullish, and we believe that
consensus EPS forecasts are too optimistic.
Valuation
We are maintaining our December 2025 price target of $106. Our price target assumes
a 1.8x multiple on our 12/31/25E BV ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.9x multiple on our 12/31/25E
BV forecast, and an 11.0x multiple on our 2026 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this
approach with a sum-of-the-parts analysis that values ACGL's re/insurance business
separately from mortgage insurance. Our target multiples for ACGL reflect its current
business mix, which has become less skewed to MI. ACGL trades at 1.7x BV and 11.7x
2025E EPS compared to 1.3x and 8.4x for the reinsurance sector, 1.1x and 8.4x for MI peers,
and 1.9x and 12.4x for the broader P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for a prolonged period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS forecasts and boost sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. We
believe investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low-to-mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, even as the tailwind from the current hard market abates.
· Arch announces a sizable share repurchase program. Steady repurchases by leading
reinsurers could help prolong the hard market as well as drive an uptick in EPS forecasts.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· Greater capacity enters the reinsurance market. This, in turn, could result in further
softening of pricing and drive a reduction in EPS estimates and hurt investor sentiment.
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
· The tailwind from reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development
has been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in the pace
of development could pressure margins and returns.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
Coverage Universe: Bhullar, Jimmy S: AFLAC, Inc. (AFL), Allstate (ALL), American International Group (AIG), Aon (AON), Arch Capital
(ACGL), Brighthouse Financial (BHF), Chubb Ltd (CB), Corebridge Financial (CRBG), Equitable Holdings Inc (EQH), Globe Life Inc (GL),
Hartford Financial Services (HIG), Lincoln National (LNC), Marsh & McLennan (MMC), MetLife, Inc. (MET), Principal Financial Group
