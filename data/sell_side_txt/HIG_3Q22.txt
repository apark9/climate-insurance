3Q22 Earnings Review
Our focus is on total returns, HIG's premium growth and WC
bias can fuel nice NII upside from higher net invested assets.
While we do not think this is the time to grow auto PIF (+1.2%
q/q vs. its historical declines), auto is not a material
component of HIG's enterprise (10.5% of premiums earned).

Potential Upside/Downside
+13.6%
NII upside should more than offset auto headwinds: HIG's new money rate of about 4.9% is well
ahead of its 3.7% average yield of assets rolling off (both pre-tax). In translation, HIG is
expecting its annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, to increase by ~10 to 20
bps in 4Q22 and ~50 to 60 bps in 2023 from 2022. HIG is also shortening its asset duration (4.0 in
Sept' 22 vs. 4.8 in March 21), which should accelerate its portfolio turnover rate. While HIG's
investment posture is conservative, we pay attention to changes on the margin. In terms of
asset allocations on an amortized cost basis, HIG is growing in ABS (+75% since YE21) and RMBS
(+17% since YE21). These are asset classes linked to consumer finance.
On the personal auto side, HIG's +1.2% PIF growth q/q in this business is ahead of its historical
trend. HIG had originally expected improvements in auto physical damage in 2H22 that is not
materializing. HIG is ramping up its auto filing efforts (from 5% in 3Q22 to double-digits in 4Q &
mid-teens in 1H23), although we think it will take longer for those rates to earn in, especially
considering that the bulk of its inforce is still on 12-month policies. (Note, its more recent
marketing efforts for Prevail are centered on 6-month policies). Unlike ALL, HIG is not calling
out higher bodily injury claims and/or higher attorney representations. To be sure, HIG's
favorable auto PYD reflects AY2018 and prior, although we are surprised that the auto claims
cycle can span those multiple years.

HIG is maintaining its loss trends, excluding workers' compensation, 100 bps below its pricing
level. As HIG reported 6.4% of commercial lines (ex WC) renewal pricing in 3Q22, we assume that
its loss trend is ~5.5%, which feels up from prior commentary of 5%. Within WC, indemnity loss
trends are contained in wage growth and HIG's long-term medical severity for comp is 5%. While
HIG experienced some WC underlying margin compression in 3Q22, it was within its
expectations (<0.5 points). We recognize that on an absolute basis, WC is a high underwriting
margin business with greater NII upside than other lines. WC pricing is also in positive territory,
though we think most of that is driven from exposures that act like rate (i.e. audit premiums).

Peer Leading P&C ROE: HIG's core ROE of 14.0% is at the upper end of its 13-14% '22 guidance.
In particular, its core ROE in P&C of 17.7% is peer leading and ahead of its segment guide of 14-
15%, which is impressive considering a heavy catastrophe quarter and tough auto headwinds.
HIG's core ROE within group benefits of 6.6% and well below its segment guide of 10-11%.

3Q22 vs. Target Financial Plan
HIG's personal lines underlying CR was 95.9% in 3Q22, tracking above its FY22 guided range of
91-94% (updated last quarter by 1-2 points). On a YTD basis it's inside the range at 92.8%,
although we recognize on a seasonality perspective, 4Q auto loss trends usually run higher. HIG
expects to meet its guided ranges in 2022.
Commercial lines underlying CR of 89.3% in 3Q22 is on track to meet HIG's 2022E outlook range
of 86.5%-88.5%. Group Benefits 7.2% core earnings margin and 8.7% ex-COVID in 2Q22 is ahead
of the 2022E outlook ranges (3.1-5.4% inc. COVID and 6-7% ex-COVID) in the quarter. We are
modeling better commercial lines premiums in 2022 than HIG's plan (BARC: 11.3% vs. HIG: 4-
5%).

HIG is ramping up its auto rate actions and anticipates to see double digit increases in 4Q and
mid-teens increases for 1H23. We think these rating actions are on a written basis and may take
time to fully earn in for its inforce, as the bulk are written under 12 month policies.
The auto underlying combined ratio of 102.6% was up 2.6 pts sequentially. HIG saw higher than
expected severity, most evident in physical damage with bodily injury being a less significant
driver.
Auto Underlying Loss ratio: To get worse before it gets better. On a seasonality perspective,
we keep in mind that HIG's auto loss ratio runs at the highest level in the fourth quarter (about 3
to 5 points) than the annual loss ratio. Conversely, 1Q auto loss costs run lower than the balance
of the year.
The homeowners underlying combined ratio of 80.4% was down 1.6 pts q/q. HIG is also
pushing for rate on the homeowners side with 12% rate increases seen in 3Q22.
The loss ratio for Personal lines increased to 82.5% in 3Q22 compared to 73.4% in 2Q22 and
71.2% in 3Q21.

Underlying Commercial Margin
Commercial lines underlying margin worsened to 89.3% ~2.1 pts y/y and 1.2 pts q/q. Over the
last 2 quarters, HIG's global specialty underlying combined ratio was better than small
commercial which we partly attribute to pricing as well as HIG's underwriting influence on the
old NAVG book. HIG is targeting commercial lines underlying combined ratio of 86.5%- 88.5% in
2022 (BARC estimate 88.5%).
Segment Underlying Results:
· Middle & Large Commercial underlying combined ratio of 93.7% in 3Q22 worsened from
92.9% in 2Q22, partly due to unfavorable non-cat weather.
· Small Commercial underlying combined ratio at 88.5% in 3Q22 worsened from 86.9% in
2Q22, partly due to unfavorable non-cat weather and WC margins.
· Global Specialty underlying combined ratio of 84.5% in 3Q22 worsened from 83.1% in
2Q22, but improved y/y by 2.4 points.
Group Benefits
Core earnings margin of 7.2% is trending above'22 guidance including COVID of 3.1%-5.4%, and
better than our estimate of 5.5%. HIG's margins included a pandemic headwind of $26mn and a
$5mn headwind related to pre-tax COVID-19 related short term disability claims. The group
benefits core earnings margin adjusted for pandemic excess mortality and COVID-19 ST
disability losses was 8.7%, above its guided range of 6-7%.
Forward Looking Commentary/Model Updates
· Higher NII guide: Annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, to increase by
~10 to 20 bps in 4Q22 (we are estimating 3.45%) and ~50 to 60 bps in 2023 from 2022. HIG
posted 3.1% (pre-tax) annualized yield, ex LLP, in the first nine months of 2022. On the same
basis, we are estimating 3.21% for FY22 and 3.76% for FY23.
· HIG anticipates annualized LP returns in FY2022 to be at the high end of its 8-10% range.
HIG posted 13.0% (pre-tax) annualized LLP returns in the first nine months of 2022. In order
to arrive at the high end of its 8-10% annual target, we are estimating below trend 3%
returns in 4Q22E.
· Capital Returns: During 3Q22 HIG repurchased $350mn of shares (vs. our $311mn estimate)
and repurchased $98mn from Oct. 1-26, 2022. HIG has $3.1bn remaining on its board
authorized buyback programs through YE24. In 4Q22, HIG expects to receive $400mn of
31 October 2022
5
Barclays | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
dividends from its U.S. P&C insurance subsidiaries, $45mn from HLA (Group Benefits) and
$40mn from Hartford Funds. HIG's holding co. cash and marketable assets totaled $1.1bn as
of Sept. 30, 2022. We are modeling a $345mn quarterly buyback run-rate.
We reiterate our Overweight rating on HIG and raise our PT to $82 (from $78) based on a
50/50 weighted 10.5x $8.19 (up from $8.04) '23E EPS and 1.3x (from 1.2x) 2023E book value per
share ex AOCI of $59.4 (up from $59.2). Trading at 8.6x 2023E P/E, HIG offers one of the best long
term risk/rewards in P/C insurance, in our view.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $82 price target on HIG is based on a 50/50 weighted 10.5x '23E EPS and 1.3x 2023E book value per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.
