Jan results: Material EPS beat on
lower-than-expected catastrophe
losses and favorable PYD
Significant net EPS beat comes on far lower-than-expected
catastrophe losses, sizable favorable reserve development,
and solid company wide performance.
January net EPS of $1.90 was well above our estimate of $1.01. The beat was primarily due to 1)
solid total company performance, 2) much lower-than-expected catastrophe losses attributable
to the California Wildfires, and 3) significant favorable prior year development. Cat losses came
in at $46 million, which were significantly below our $276 million estimate, as losses from the
California wildfires were only $43 million, well below our $230 million estimate. 72% of the
California losses occurred in their personal property products. Progressive also saw favorable
prior year development to the tune of $115 million, or 170 bps, which was far better than our
$109 million unfavorable development expectation, which is a pleasant surprise given,
historically speaking, January is a month that usually sees adverse PYD. Company wide
underlying loss ratio came in above our expectations at 65% vs. our 64.5%. However, Underlying
combined ratio came in 60 bps below our estimate, printing a 85.2% vs. our 85.8%. PIF growth
continues to be very strong as company wide PIF comes in a touch above our estimates at
17.9% vs. our 17.8%. NPW growth missed our mark of 25.2%, coming in at 17.9%. However, NPE
growth of 22.3% came in well above our estimate of 17%. Overall, a solid print as catastrophes
came in much better than expected, favorable PYD was significant, and a continued strong
company wide underlying combined contributed to a bottom-line beat.
Policies In Force: PIF growth was very strong yet again for the month of January coming in 10
bps above our company wide expectations. Company wide PIF growth came in at 17.9% vs. our
expectation of 17.8%. Agency saw growth of 17.7% y/y, which compares to our 17.4% estimate.
Direct grew 25.3% y/y vs. our 25.1% estimate. Personal Lines showed growth of 22.1%, slightly
above our 21.8%. Commercial growth came in at 4.6% y/y vs. our 4.5% estimate. Lastly,
Property PIF grew 13%, slightly below our 13.7% estimate. Sequentially, Agency PIF grew 104k
and Direct PIF grew 228k.
Personal Lines: Underlying loss ratio came in at 64.5%, slightly below our 64.6% estimate.
Expense ratio came in at 20.2%, which compares to our 21.1% estimate. Underlying combined
therefore came in at 84.7%, below our 85.7% estimate. NPW growth was 22% vs. our 28.7%. NPE
growth was 26%, above our 22.8% estimate. Personal Lines posted underwriting income of
$872.9 million compared to our $492.6 million. On a segment basis within Personal, Agency
Barclays Capital Inc. and/or one of its affiliates does and seeks to do business with companies
covered in its research reports. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a

underlying combined ratio of 79.9% was better than our 83% estimate and Direct's underlying
combined of 88.4% was a touch above our 87.8% estimate.
Commercial Lines: Underlying loss ratio in Commercial Lines was 69.1%, slightly above our
68% estimate. Underlying combined ratio came in at 87.6%, a touch below our 88.2%
estimate. NPW growth of 0.2% came in weaker than our 7.5% estimate, although we would note
commercial lines NPW was lower due to the monthly adjustment for projected mileage in the
TNC business and excluding this, NPW growth would have been 2% for the month. NPE growth,
however, was 6.9%, well above of -8.1% estimate. Underwriting income of $129.7 million came
in well above our $66.4 million estimate.
Property: Underlying loss ratio came in much better than expected at 45.1% vs. our 52%.
Expense ratio also came in at 29.2% in-line with our estimate of 29.2%. Underlying combined
ratio was 74.3% vs. our 81.2% estimate, a strong beat. NPW growth was -5.9% y/y for January
vs. our 14% growth estimate, and NPE growth of 11.3% came in higher than our 4% estimate.
Underwriting income of $45 million was far above our $-50.2 million estimate.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related

Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $264 reflects a ~5.0x P/BVPS xAOCI multiple on our 2Q25E BVPS xAOCI estimate of $54.26 which we derive
from a P/BV vs ROE regression and assuming PGR trades at a 47% premium to the regression line.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside Risks: The greatest upside risk is that PGR
executes on its growth strategy better than we anticipate driving top line led beat and raises. Downside Risks: We see downside risk if PGR is not able
to meet high expectations for growth or if that growth leads to more margin pressure than expected.

information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by
Barclays or a third party ("Information"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration
is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes ("ESG Regimes"), unless
otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers
or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification,
label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are
reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
