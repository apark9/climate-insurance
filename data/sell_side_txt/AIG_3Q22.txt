3Q22 Earnings: Financial Lines
Reserves Statutory Review
We explore two topics that caught our attention in the 3Q
print: Potentially growing property catastrophe risk after a
conscious effort to reduce exposure and Financial Lines Loss
picks (included in this note is a schedule P analysis).

Since CY2019, AIG has experienced $1.8bn of cumulative adverse development on U.S.
Financial Lines. To be sure, its overall PYD experience has been positive during the same period
and we do not have any fundamental concerns about reserve adequacy (in fact, YTD AIG
completed its reserve review on 90% of its book). Since AIG's $660mn of adverse PYD for U.S.
Financial lines during 3Q22 were predominantly for AYs 2018-2019, and to a lesser extent
AY2020, we focus our attention on those AYs (that are not subject to its ADC). We reviewed the
development of schedule P loss picks for a selection of top D&O underwriters in those years. A
limitation is relying on 2021 statutory data, a slight lag from current performance. See figures 1-
4 for further details.
We recognize AIG's multi-prong approach to risk selection (limit profile, attachment point, etc.)
and reunderwriting during AYs 2018-2020. Nonetheless, we think it can take 3-5 years for D&O
reserves to fully develop, therefore those AYs are still green. Likewise pricing was less rich in
2018-2020 than what we are seeing now considering the compounding effect. AIG's D&O prior
year emergence continues to be driven by large losses.

In conclusion, we observed significant variability of the development of insurers' loss picks
(other liability claims made) in AYs: 2018, 2019 and 2020. AIG experienced more upward
revisions to its loss picks for AY2017-2019 than peers while AIG's AY2020 loss pick is
relatively lower than the pull forward from prior years. To take it one step further, AIG, TRV
and the industry have reduced their AY2021 initial loss picks vs. AY2020 while CB raised its
AY2021 loss picks relative to prior years, a more conservative stance. On the earnings call, AIG
mentioned that its primary and excess not-for-profit loss pick for policy year '21 at 18 months of
development is 80% lower than the prior year which reflects management's confidence of how
different its book is today.

Appetite to grow property catastrophe underwriting. According to Peter Zaffino, Chairman &
CEO "I think that the market will be very good for us to deploy more property. But again, we'll be
disciplined, and we'll see what really transpires over the next 60 to 90 days. " We take that
statement as more opportunistic, where it makes the most sense for AIG to participate.
Reinsurance availability can be a significant factor for the deployment of capital on the primary
side. We do not see AIG growing in property on the personal lines side in any meaningful way.

We point out that while AIG manages its property catastrophe risk relative to capital by legal
entity, S&P takes an enterprise view of capital. We think that AIG's catastrophe risk charge to
S&P capital had benefited from a larger balance sheet that included life operations. With a
smaller balance sheet, post separation, we see its PML growth to be more constrained.

Industry Loss Picks: Other Liability Claims Made
Insurers' narrative behind the continuation of hard pricing has been a rising claims
environment. However, the industry has not raised its initial loss picks in AY2021 relative to
prior years with significant variability by insurer.
The industry has raised its other liability claims made loss picks for AYs 2018 and 2019 (from
initial to current ) by 7.5 and 3.4 points, respectively. In contrast, the industry has lowered its

2020 loss pick by 2.3 points (12 months development). The industry's AY2021 loss pick of 62% is
relatively lower than prior years.

NA Commercial Pricing Coming Back in 3Q
NA Commercial pricing grew to +9% in 3Q22 vs +7% in 2Q22 and +8% in 1Q22. At the same time
AIG raised its view of loss trends to 6.5% in 3Q22 from 6.0% in 2Q22, mostly reflecting
inflationary pressure son property loss cost trends on its weighted average. Just looking at
excess casualty, loss trends are in the double digits. Digging into the segment contributions,
International Commercial pricing dropped q/q to +6% in 3Q22 from +7% in 2Q22 and +10% in
1Q22.

3Q Highlights
North America Commercial rate, ex WC, increased 9% (from 7% in 2Q22) in 3Q22 and continued
to exceed loss cost trends. Last quarter, AIG characterized loss trend as 6% but should look
more like 4% when taking into account 2 points of exposure growth. Note, other P&C insurers
refer to the reverse, inflationary exposure as a component of rate, obscuring peer comparisons.
PYD Spotlight: On a net basis, AIG's net favorable PYD was $72mn for 3Q22. AIG disclosed
favorable PYD from global personal lines, global specialty and WC offset by adverse PYD in U.S.
Financial Lines.
Underlying combined ratio of 88.4% (210 bps improvement y/y) vs. our estimated 89.4% despite
deterioration seen in NA Personal Lines. The standout is International Commercial AYCR
improvements by 6.4 pts y/y. NA Commercial AYLR improved 4.0 pts y/y and on a sequential
basis it improved by 80 bps to 62.5% from 63.3%. GI NPW declined 3% y/y, with a drag mostly
seen in international personal lines. On a FX constant basis GI NPW growth was 3%.
NA Personal Lines AYCR deteriorated to 112.8% in 3Q22 vs. 99.8% in 2Q22 and 98.4% in 3Q21
reflecting ongoing remediation in PCG - from admitted to non-admitted. AIG is still committed
to its business. We would like to better understand the economics and efficiency of its
reinsurance program (i.e. Syndicate 2019). The growth side was impacted by one large client
non-renewal.
L&R: AIG continues to grow spread business with doubling of sales in FAs and robust FIA
production. That said fee income was down amid weaker capital market conditions. AIG is
seeing less adverse mortality. AIG's stake in CRBG is currently 77.7%. AIG consolidates CRBG
results (NCI reflects its the equity interest not owned by AIG) until its ownership stake is <50%.

Barclays | AIG, Inc.
Key Results
EPS Beat: AIG's 3Q22 Operating EPS of $0.66 was above our $0.51 estimate and $0.46 consensus
Street estimate. The beat primarily reflects better-than-expected GI underwriting gains
including lower catastrophe losses and better underlying combined ratio, somewhat offset by
lower NII due to lower alternative performance vs our estimates.
BVPS (common) fell to $51.58 in 3Q22, from to $58.16 in 2Q22, mostly due to negative marks.
VII: Alternative returns were $194mn (pre-tax) worse than AIG's expectations.
Cat losses: $600mn (net of reinsurance) vs. our $830mn estimate.
Capital Management: Parent liquidity was strong at $6.5bn at the end of the quarter, up from
$5.6bn at the end of 2Q22. To recap, AIG received $1.7bn of gross proceeds from the CRBG IPO.
$1.3bn of buybacks were completed during the quarter (vs. our $1.25bn estimate).
Forward Looking Statements
· Capital Deployment: AIG expects to put additional capital into its insurance subsidiaries for
organic growth. AIG is bullish about the E&S market in particular. AIG is aiming to reduce its
share count to 600-650mn range, while achieving leverage at the 20% to 25% level post-
deconsolidation.
. CRBG windows for a secondary offering: Mid to late March, mid May or late June. Net
proceeds to be delayed for share repurchases
· Share buybacks: AIG has $4.3bn remaining on its current share repurchase authorization
and expect to end 2022 with >$5bn of buybacks. We are taking down our buyback
assumption to $5.25bn from our original $5.87bn for FY22.
· Fixed income/loan portfolio yields: Expected to rise 10-15 bps in 4Q, following +17 bps in
3Q, and +9 bps in 2Q. Over time, yield uplift from NII could add 1 to 2 pts to ROCE.
· CRBG is expecting spread expansion from compression beginning in 2023.
· Expense savings: Remaining $350mn be realized from AIG 200; ~ $300mn of corporate GOE
and ~$400mn of interest expense that will be transferred to Corebridge; and additional
expense savings transitioning AIG to a leaner operating model.
Valuation
Our Equal Weight rating and $59 price target (up from $53) are based on a 50/50 weighted
average of 10x (up from 9.0x) our 2023 EPS estimate and 0.7x (up from 0.6x) our 2023 book value
per share (ex-AOCI) estimate. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group
given we expect lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

A: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has been lead manager or co-lead manager of a publicly disclosed offer of securities of AIG, Inc. in the previous
12 months.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
D: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. in the past 12 months.
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. within the
next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by AIG, Inc. and/or in any related derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from AIG, Inc. within the past 12 months.
L: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
N: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $59 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 10x our 2023 EPS estimate and 0.7x
our 2023 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given we expect lower ROEs,
especially for GI standalone.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a separation.
Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to walk away from
business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings or capital but
undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post separation may temper
AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.

N: Chubb Limited is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC

Valuation Methodology: Our Overweight rating and $255 price target are based on 50/50 weighted average P/E of 15x our 2023 EPS estimate and 1.5x
our 2023 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate. Our target multiples for CB are above the P/C insurance group based on a stronger, more durable
earnings trajectory and greater excess capital.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Lower investment income is expected but
underutilization of the underwriting platform (not taking full advantage of hard pricing / customer base seeks out cheaper insurance providers or a
material adverse reserve development) could keep fundamentals from accelerating. Chubb does have a sizeable capital buffer which in our view is an
overhang on ROE.
