Shares Travel Higher Post Clean Print + Model Update
Our Call
A good Q3 with a strong BI underlying margin, no movement in GL reserves, and great
personal lines underlying results sent shares higher. We are not sure the 190bps of core
margin improvement in BI is run-ratable (no one-off items were highlighted).
The stock from here: TRV shares responded well to earnings; with shares at 12.4x our
2025 EPS we do not see much upside from here. We are not fully convinced the 190 bps
of core underlying BI loss ratio improvement is run-ratable, and we assume 90 bps in Q4
and have it tricking off from there. TRV did not call out any one-off items in BI margin and
said it was a good starting point, which we find surprising given homeowners' benefited
from 10 points of favorable non-cat and non-weather losses.
Estimate and price target changes: Our 2024E EPS estimate goes up to $19.17 (from
$17.80) to mainly reflect the Q3 upside, partially offset by a higher Q4 cat load as we
assume $152m of Milton losses (within range of their guide of $75-175m). Our 2025E
EPS goes up to $21.35 (from $20.65) and 2026E EPS estimate goes to $22.75 (from
$22.05) reflecting better underlying margin in BI and personal lines and higher NII. Our
price target goes to $256 (from $207) based on 12.0x our 2025 EPS estimate.
Additional GL color: Travelers hosted a sell side meeting on 10/18 and the company
reiterated comments that they had made about their GL reserves 90 days ago. They were
proactive and decisive in the reserving action that they took for the GL line in the Q2. The
most recent years are very green (85% of the losses have yet to be paid) and will be paid
out over the next 7-10 years. TRV did highlight that umbrella (as well as auto) led the way
in terms of BI pricing in the quarter.
Read-throughs: (1) TRV saw improved commercial lines pricing in the quarter, which
should be a positive for other small-to-mid market writers (HIG + regionals), (2) the
2025 NII guide was close to us (CB also guides for NII but only guides one quarter out), (3)
the company saw favorable current year results (two points in personal auto) which is a
positive for other personal auto writers (like ALL, which we highlight as our tactical bullish
call in the P&C space for the quarter).
Cats, auto frequency + other: Travelers is contemplating guiding around cat losses in
2025, and they also might provide some color around premium-to-surplus goals as
well. Within personal lines, auto results benefited from two points from releases on
earlier quarters in the year (from favorable frequency) as TRV sees more quarters of
beneficial frequency they will become more convinced it will be durable. For more details
on earnings, see our first look note here and conference call takes here.

Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the good pricing
environment within commercial lines and improving margins within
personal auto. With that being said, we think there are questions on
their reserves following the increases for liability lines in H1 and as
a result, we think the shares could underperform the broader group
until they show a lack of movement on the reserve side. We rate the
shares Equal Weight

Base Case | $256.00
. Our price target of $256 is based on
just over 12.0x our 2025 EPS estimate.
We come to the 12.0x multiple using an
average of the multiples for AIG, CB and
HIG.
· Implies around a ~ 1.8x multiple of our
projected 2025 book value estimate of
~$140.
Upside Scenario | $280.00
. Our upside scenario is $280 and
assumes a multiple of ~13.1x our 2025
EPS estimate and ~2.0x our 2025 book
value estimate of ~$140.
· A continued firm commercial pricing
environment with no material changes
to loss cost trends
. No material reserve additions
. Normal cat loads
· Strong level of buybacks
Downside Scenario | $213.00
. Our downside scenario is $213 and is
based on 10.0x our 2025 EPS estimate
and ~1.5x our 2025 book value estimate
of ~$140.
.
Material softening in the RRC,
particularly in BI
· Loss cost trends rise, and we see further
additions to reserves (especially within
general liability)
· Personal auto margins reverse course
and return to unprofitability
Upcoming Catalysts
· Commercial pricing survey data from MarketScout and Ivans,
which track movement in rate across various commercial lines,
including workers' compensation
· Commentary from other peers around loss cost trends,
reserves, and rate adequacy in lines including commercial and
personal insurance lines
· Q4 earnings, which will be reported in January 2025

Highlights of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of our estimate changes. The exhibit below highlights the changes we made to our earnings
model following Q3 2024 earnings.
· 2024 EPS goes up to $19.17 (from $17.82) to primarily reflect the Q3 beat and modestly better
underlying margin in BI in the Q4. We assume 40 basis point of BI underlying margin improvement
in Q4 with 90 bps of rate over trend and an assumed reversal of the favorable non-cat weather
from last year (level wasn't quantified, but we assume it is 50bps).
. 2025 EPS goes up to $21.35 (from $20.65) to reflect modestly higher NII and better underlying
margin in BI and personal insurance.
. 2026 EPS goes up to $22.75 (from $22.05) to reflect modestly higher NII and better underlying
margin in BI and personal insurance.

Renewal Premium Growth
Personal Lines: Auto RPC should remain strong
but begin to move down from here as more of the
book reaches rate adequacy on a written basis.
Homeowners' RPC (19.4% in Q3) should remain
consistent through the end of the year, and then it
should moderate into the low double-digits.
Business Insurance: Given the uncertainty in
terms of weather volatility, economic and social
inflation, hardening reinsurance market and the
geopolitical landscape TRV will continue to push
for price increases to achieve its return
objectives.
Business Insurance: No outlook commentary
Business Insurance: No outlook commentary
Personal Lines: Auto RPC should remain in the
mid-teens through H1, while homeowners' RPC
should moderate to the low double-digits in 2024
as their automatic increase in limit factors will
return to more normal levels
Personal Lines: Auto RPC (16.6% in the Q1)
should slow from here given improved
profitability, while Homeowners' RPC (13.4% in
the Q1) should remain consistent through the
balance of the year.
Business Insurance: They expect RPC to
continue to be positive and strong and in
particular driven by casualty
Business Insurance: They expect RPC to
remain strong and positive

Business Insurance Rating Environment-RRC up sequentially; exposure slows
· RRC: Business Insurance renewal rate change (RRC) was +7.3% in the Q3, an acceleration from
+6.5% in Q2. They noted on their conference call that umbrella and auto continue to lead the way
with rate increases well into double-digits. In terms of sequential RRC, every line was at or higher
than the second quarter. Property accounted for 18.5% of premiums in the Q3 (vs 19.0% in the
Q2 and 19.1% in the prior year quarter) while workers' comp accounted for 14.4% of premiums (vs
15.3% in the Q2 and 15.3% in the prior year quarter).
· Exposure: Exposure growth was up 3.2%, down from the 3.7% in Q2 and the lowest exposure
change since 2020.
· RPC: Renewal premium change (RPC) was 10.5% in Q3, up from the 10.2% in Q2. They highlighted
on their conference that strong pricing was broad-based with RPC at or close to double digits
in every line other than workers' comp. The exhibits below show the trends in TRV's quarterly
domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal rate change since 2020.

Pricing Highlights-Personal Lines
Personal Lines-TRV sees rate slow in auto, and relatively flat in home
· Personal Auto renewal premium change (RPC) decelerated sequentially to 12.8% from 15.9% in
Q2 and their auto underlying combined ratio remained below 100% (91.2% in the quarter) after
returning to profitability in Q1 2024, with the combined ratio at 93.4%, the best margin since
Q2 2021. The underlying margin was down 4.0% sequentially, and down 9.4% Y/Y, although the
company noted 2.0 pts of Y/Y improvement was driven by reserve releases on earlier quarters
of the year. They expect personal auto RPC to continue to decelerate from here given improved
profitability.
. Homeowners' RPC decelerated modestly sequentially to 14.6% in Q3 from 14.8% in Q2 with the
expectation RPC remains near these levels in the Q4.
. Auto and home PIFs down sequentially. Travelers' new business in auto was down 6% Y/Y at $312
million, after seeing new business down 6% in the Q2. Auto PIFs were down 0.6% sequentially (vs
down 0.9% in the Q2). Home new business was down 12% in the quarter (an improvement from
the decline of 27% in Q2). From a PIF standpoint, home was down 0.9%, which was modestly better
than the 1.1% sequential decline in Q2. TRV noted on their call that the decline in home PIF and
new business was as intended as the decline was most significant in high-risk cat geographies as
they continue to reduce exposure and mitigate volatility through improved risk selection, restricted
binding authority, tightened eligibility requirements and higher deductibles. As for the auto PIF
decline, they are working on returning to PIF growth, but they noted the decline in PIF is driven by
a few challenging states where they are working on getting the rate needed as well as cross-line
impact from their property high-risk cat exposure management actions.

Valuation
Current valuation. As of 10/18 close, TRV shares are now trading at a 10-year peak level of 2.18x Q3
2024 book value, and well above its 5-year (1.56x) average, and its 10-year (1.49x) average multiple.
When excluding unrealized losses (net), shares still trade at a high multiple of 1.94x Q3 adjusted book
of $137.12, which is well above the 1.39x 5-year average ex AOCI. On a price-to-earnings basis, the
shares are trading at 12.4x our updated 2025 estimate above the 5-year average of 11.4x, 10-year
average of 11.6x, but below the 10-year peak of 14.2x. We believe the valuation of the shares is pretty
full from here as it is trading above historical averages on both a P/E and P/BV level, and we could still
see more movement in general liability reserves in the Q4 (we were not expecting any reserve charge
outside of asbestos in the Q3) and should see elevated cats in the Q4 as well with Milton losses.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the good pricing environment within commercial lines and improving margins within
personal auto. With that being said, we think there are questions on their reserves following the increases for liability lines in H1 and as a
result, we think the shares could underperform the broader group until they show a lack of movement on the reserve side. We rate the
shares Equal Weight
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $256.00 from $207.00
. Our price target of $256 is based on just over 12.0x our 2025 EPS estimate. We come to the 12.0x multiple using an average of the
multiples for AIG, CB and HIG.
· Implies around a ~1.8x multiple of our projected 2025 book value estimate of ~$140.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth, reported / underlying margins coming in better than expected, and higher-
than-expected favorable PYD.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
