Summary: Operating EPS came in at $2.94 vs our estimate of $2.18 and Street's estimate of
$2.62. The beat came on the back of strong underlying loss and combined ratios which was
partly offset by unfavorable PYD of $101 million. NPW growth came in light of our expectation at
7.3% y/y vs. our 9.7% and the Street at 9.2%. NII provided a tailwind coming in at $708 million
vs. our $666 million and the Street at $671 million. Operating ROE xAOCI was 17.7%,
meaningfully higher than our estimate of 13.2% and Street's estimate of 16.3%. Following this
quarter's results, we look forward to the earnings call to gain some color on the reported
underlying loss ratios given the outsized unfavorable PYD they took in some lines, specifically
general liability. Overall a strong print with an outsized EPS beat that was fueled by strong
underlying in P&C and favorable cats, although the elevated unfavorable PYD in general liability
is something to note.
Prior-Year-Development: Hartford reported $101 million of unfavorable PYD for the quarter
which compares to our $155 million estimate and the Street at $135 million. This comes after
three quarters of favorable PYD totaling $221 million and compares to a $92 million charge that
was taken a year ago. The bulk of the unfavorable PYD came from their general liability line and
from an asbestos charge to the tune of $130 million and $141 million, respectively. Workers'
comp posted another quarter of material favorable PYD at $70 million, however, it was not
enough to offset the two aforementioned charges. We want to point out the dynamic between
the unfavorable PYD and the strong underlying ratios that has transpired this quarter. While
underlying loss ratios have improved substantially across the board, we do wonder whether this
is a bit too aggressive given the outsized unfavorable PYD taken in general liability.

Property & Casualty: HIG's P&C segment was the major driver behind the company's bottom
line out performance this quarter which was mainly attributed to a stronger underlying loss
ratio of 57.6% vs. our estimate of 59.3% and the Street at 59%. Both personal lines and
commercial lines posted strong results in the quarter helping contribute to the bottom line
beat. Commercial contributed to the beat posting operating earnings of $358 million which
outpaced our estimate of $225 million while the underlying loss ratio of 56.0% was also below
our estimate of 57.1%. The homeowners segment within personal lines was a main contributor

to the impressive underlying loss ratio as homeowner's underlying came in at 35.1% which
compares to our 45% estimate. Additionally, auto within personal lines underlying loss ratio
came in at 76.5% vs. our 77.5% estimate. Consolidated P&C combined ratio of 87.6% beat our
89.9% and the Street's 89.4%. Reported catastrophe losses also came in much better than
expected at $80 million vs. our estimate of $220 million and the Street at $185 million. The
combination of underlying beats in all three segments as well as weaker cats helped HIG post
strong bottom line results for the quarter.
Group Benefits: Group Benefits' reported operating earnings of $139 million beat our estimate
of $134 million which was driven by a solid core margin of 7.9% vs our estimate of 7.4%.

benefit ratio adjusted for interest boosted the business (73.1% vs our estimate of 74.6%).
Hartford Funds: The mutual funds business recorded operating earnings of $51 million which
was slightly above our estimate of $48 million. AUM came in at $128,054 million compared to
our estimate of $131,464 million due to a significant $3,108 million change in market value. With
that being said, net flows for the quarter were a positive $796 million which compares to our -
$1,021 million estimate. It is the first quarter of positive net flows since 4Q21.

OVERWEIGHT
Price (30-Jan-2025)
USD 114.26
Price Target
USD 135.00
Why OVERWEIGHT?
We like Hartford's balance sheet
strength and favorable distribution
positioning in the small to medium
end of the commercial P&C
business. However, we see the
significant improvement in
valuation already and ongoing
underlying margin pressure from
workers' compensation as reasons
that we have an Equal Weight view.
Upside case
USD 145.00
Our upside case assumes ROE
expectations increase by 50bps to
16.8% driven by release of favorable
development and strong growth in
small to middle commercial,
increasing the premium to the
regression line to 15%.
Downside case
USD 103.00
Our downside case assumes 50bps
decrease in ROE to 15.8% as
medical cost inflation accelerates
and exerts near term pressure on
profitability as pricing is unable to
reflect real-time, and the stock
trades at a 5% discount to the
regression line.

Downside
We updated our estimates to reflect the reported results and refined our projections. The
primary adjustments were related to our loss ratios assumptions in the Personal Lines segment
to reflect strong underlying margins while the company sees the impact of increased pricing
flow through to higher earnings, in addition to immaterial changes. These changes resulted in
our 2025E/2026E/2027E EPS estimates changing from $11.61/$13.14/$13.98 to
$11.71/$13.18/$13.98. We remain Overweight and our target price is maintained at $135.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $135 reflects a 1.8x P/BVPS xAOCI multiple on our 2Q25E BVPS xAOCI estimate which we derive from a
P/BV vs ROE regression and assuming HIG trades at a 7% premium to the regression line.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside Risks: We see outperformance from HIG in
the scenario where medical cost inflation remains one of the more benign areas of CPI and the company is able to have substantial reserve release
from the WC reserves. This would put HIG in a favorable position from a capital standpoint to then be able to lean into growth in the small to medium
commercial insurance market. Downside Risks: We see the main downside risk being ongoing pricing pressure on workers compensation insurance
while loss cost trend is showing some signs of beginning to increase vs the more flattish performance of WC loss trend over the past several years due
to low severity and favorable frequency trends.

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by
Barclays or a third party ("Information"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration
is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes ("ESG Regimes"), unless
otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers
or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification,
label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are
reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
