Nov Results: Continued Strong PIF
growth and Underwriting
Improvement
Solid EPS beat fueled by solid underlying results, PIF growth
beats across the board.
Summary: November net EPS of $1.71 is well above our estimate of $1.23. The beat comes
primarily due to strong performance in the Property segment and lower than expected
catastrophe losses for the month. Cat losses came in at $(18) million which was significantly
below our $63 million estimate, as favorable development associated with Hurricanes Helene
and Milton exceeded current month storm losses. Progressive also saw favorable prior year
development to the tune of $3.7 million, or 10 bps. Company wide underlying loss ratio came in
below our expectations at 65.6% vs. our 66.8%. Underlying Combined ratio also came in 220 bps
below our estimate, printing 86% vs. our 88.2%. PIF growth continues to be strong and beat our
estimates solidly across the board. NPW growth missed our mark of 29.3% by 11.6 points,
coming in at 17.7%. NPE growth of 18.9% also came in below our estimate of 24.1%. Overall, a
solid print as PIF growth remained strong, catastrophes came in much better than expected,
and strong Property results as well as solid Personal and Commercial results contributed to a
bottom line beat.
Policies In Force: PIF growth was strong yet again for the month of November, which grew
17.4% overall vs our expectation of 16.3%. Agency saw growth of 16.7% y/y which compares to
our 16% estimate. Direct grew 24.6% y/y vs. our 22.5% estimate. Personal Lines showed growth
of 18.4%, above our 17.2%. Commercial growth came in at 3.5% y/y vs. our 1.3% estimate.
Lastly, Property PIF grew 14.5%, slightly above our 14% estimate. Sequentially, Agency PIF grew
120k and Direct PIF grew 211k.
Personal Lines: Underlying loss ratio came in at 66.9%, slightly below our 67.1% estimate.
Expense ratio came in at 20.4% which compares to our 21.3% estimate. NPW growth was 21.3%
vs. our 32.7%. NPE growth was 22%, well below our 29.7% estimate. Personal Lines posted
underwriting income of $633.6 million compared to our $563.9 million. On a segment basis
within Personal, Agency underlying combined ratio of 83.5% was better than our 86.5%
estimate and Direct's underlying combined of 90.4% came in above our 89.9% estimate.
Commercial Lines: Underlying loss ratio in Commercial Lines was 64.7%, significantly below
our 70.0% estimate. NPW growth of 0.2% came in much weaker than our 13.2% estimate,
though NPE growth of 3.3% was above of -1.5% estimate. Underwriting income of 134.3 million
came in well above our $83.8 million estimate.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related

Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $277 reflects a 5.0x P/BVPS xAOCI multiple on our 2Q25E BVPS xAOCI estimate of $55.55 which we derive
from a P/BV vs ROE regression and assuming PGR trades at a 57% premium to the regression line.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Upside Risks: The greatest upside risk is that PGR
executes on its growth strategy better than we anticipate driving top line led beat and raises. Downside Risks: We see downside risk if PGR is not able
to meet high expectations for growth or if that growth leads to more margin pressure than expected.

Russia: This material is not intended for investors who are not Qualified Investors according to the laws of the Russian Federation as it might contain
information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
Any information, data, image, or other content including from a third party source contained, referred to herein or used for whatsoever purpose by
Barclays or a third party ("Information"), in relation to any actual or potential 'ESG', 'sustainable' or equivalent objective, issue, factor or consideration
is not intended to be relied upon for ESG or sustainability classification, regulatory regime or industry initiative purposes ("ESG Regimes"), unless
otherwise stated. Nothing in these materials, including any images included therein, is intended to convey, suggest or indicate that Barclays considers
or represents any product, service, person or body mentioned in these materials as meeting or qualifying for any ESG or sustainability classification,
label or similar standards that may exist under ESG Regimes. Barclays has not conducted any assessment of compliance with ESG Regimes. Parties are
reminded to make their own assessments for these purposes.
