HIG 4Q20 First Look: 520 bps Underlying
Commercial Lines Combined Ratio Expansion
Stock Rating/Industry View: Overweight/Positive
Price Target: USD 55.00
Price (04-Feb-2021): USD 50.94
Potential Upside/Downside: 8%
Tickers: HIG
Our Takeaway
4Q Core earnings were $636mn, $1.76 per share, beating our estimates of $466mn, $1.30 per
share, driven primarily better than expected net investment income of $556mn vs. our estimate of
$437mn. Underlying margins in both commercial and personal were better than expected.
Net Investment Income (NII) of $556mn was ahead our estimate of $437mn on higher income from LPs
(income of $152mn, up from $51mn y/y) and other alternative investments. This was partially offset by lower
reinvestment rates.
HIG's All-in P&C Combined Ratio (CR) 97% missed our estimate (95.3%) despite the P&C expense
ratio (30.5% vs. our estimate of 31.5%) improving by 3.2 pts y/y. Underlying was impacted by
unfavorable PYD of $184mn, 6.1 pts (vs. our estimate of a favorable PYD of $5mn, -0.2pts) and cat losses of
$55mn, 1.8 pts (vs. our estimate of $124mn, 4.1pts).
HIG's unfavorable PYD is misleading as $218mn relates to A&E losses that are covered by its ADC. After
accounting for $220mn of A&E cessions to the ADC, HIG recognized a net A&E reserve release of $2mn. Total
favorable PYD was actually $31mn in 4Q.
520 bps underlying commercial lines combined ratio expansion y/y, is better than peers. HIG's
underlying P&C CR was 89% (vs. our estimate of 91.4%).
P&C COVID-19 losses (pre-tax) continued to trend down in 4Q at $28mn vs. $37mn in 3Q and $251mn in
2Q. We anticipated COVID-19 losses peaking in 2020, we think we will likely see some loss creep through the
duration of the pandemic and potentially beyond. HIG includes COVID-19 losses in its underlying results. HIG's
COVID-19 P&C incurred losses to date total $278mn (net of favorable development in WC), in our view
relatively more conservative than competitors. Conversely, Group Life reported excess mortality from COVID-19
of $152mn pretax.
No repurchases in 4Q: We expected HIG to complete $175mn of repurchases in 4Q, which was less than the
$650mn remaining under its 2020 repurchase authorization. HIG announced a new $1.5bn repurchase
authorization in Dec 2020 which is effective through Dec 2022.

estimate of $773mn).

Mentioned Stocks (Ticker, Date, Price)
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG, 04-Feb-2021, USD 50.94), Overweight/Positive,
CD/CE/J/K/M
Valuation Methodology: Our Overweight rating and $55 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted
average P/E of 9.6x our 2021 EPS estimate of $5.65 and 1.1x YE21 estimated book value per share (ex-
AOCI) of $51.8.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target:
The primary risk to our thesis include greater exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business
closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially migrate remotely
going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also
materialize. On the balance sheet side, HIG also has greater asset durational mismatch than peers resulting
from roots as a life insurer, which in the event of an interest rate spike (which we don't expect) the MTM
impact on assets would be more impactful vs. peers which closely match ALM.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts
that are deemed to be in the same industry ("the industry coverage universe"). To see a list of companies
that comprise a particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage
universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy,
hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research
report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the
industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events
that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain
circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in
a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor
deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
