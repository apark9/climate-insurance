1Q22 Earnings Review: Peer Leading
P&C ROE
HIG had a strong 1Q print, even as we parse through P&C
tailwinds: Favorable auto seasonality & lower than normal non-
cat experience. Seasonality worked the other way for group
benefits with typical LTD elevation; management is confident it
will reach its 6-7% margin target in '22.

We were pleased to see sequential commercial underlying margin expansion considering last
quarter's sequential underwriting margin compression. Yet HIG is likely past its trough back in
3Q21 with a commercial underlying combined ratio of 87.2% vs. 88.3% in 1Q22 and 88.9% in
4Q21. We have high conviction that HIG will meet its '22 outlook of achieving an underlying
combined ratio within Commercial of 86.5%-88.5% (our estimate is 86.9%), but we think further
improvements will likely come from the expense ratio side rather than loss ratio side. We
recognize about 1 point of its 2.9 pts of y/y improvement was attributed to favorable non-
catastrophe weather somewhat offset by Ukraine related reinstatement premiums and a large
marine loss.
HIG's auto underlying combined ratio of 93.3% was up 7 pts y/y yet it improved sequentially by
12.1 pts. We recognize that part of auto performance is seasonality, with its loss ratio running
lower on average in 1Q vs. the year. We also think the rise in bodily injury trends may still be
emerging for the sector.

Seasonality worked the other way for group benefits with typical LTD elevation, as its
normalized margin was 5.7%. Management is confident it will reach its 6-7% margin target in
'22. Still, during 1Q21, HIG's adjusted core margin on the same basis was 9.9%, which would
include typical seasonality.

Peer Leading P&C ROE: HIG's core ROE of 14.8% is trending well ahead of its 13-14% guidance.
In particular, its core ROE in P&C of 19.6% got our attention as peer leading and ahead of its
segment guide of 14-15%. HIG's core ROE within group benefits was disappointing at 3.5% and
well below its segment guide of 10-11%. Lastly, Hartford Funds core ROE of 59.4% is trending
above its segment guide of 54-55%. Note, HIG excludes AOCI from the denominator of its CORE
ROE.
Strong alternative returns (with annualized LP yield of 14.6% pre-tax vs. 8-10% guide) were
offset by a lower fixed maturities yield of 2.9%. HIG's annual portfolio turnover rate is 10-15%.
New money rate of about 3.8% is ahead of its 3.3% average reinvestment rate during 1Q22. We

were previously modeling a steady decline in book yields; now we are modeling a modest
reverse resulting in somewhat higher NII.
Limited Russia/Ukraine exposure: HIG recognized $27mn of net catastrophe losses, primarily
related to political violence and terrorism, including aviation war and credit and political risk
insurance. As HIG heavily reinsures its exposures, it accordingly recognized a $11mn
reinstatement premium that we understand is not adjusted in its international global specialty
underlying loss ratio. HIG's direct investment exposure is the $16mn carrying value of Russian
corporate bonds, of which HIG wrote down $9mn.

Why OVERWEIGHT?
HIG has sound fundamentals following
transformation, which should continue
to drive a stronger book multiple. ROE
convergence with peers should make
current valuation look inexpensive.
Navigators acquisition is becoming
more accretive given boost from hard
pricing in specialty lines. HIG has
accelerated the pace of its expense
savings plans.
Upside case
USD 90.00
Our upside case reflects stronger than
expected underwriting margin
expansion and commercial P&C
pricing levels and improving group
benefits margins. Our upside case is
~1.5x '23 BVPS ex AOCI.
Downside case
USD 65.00
Our downside case assumes
unsuccessful underwriting margin
expansion and expense savings as well
as a slowdown in the commercial P&C
renewal rate environment. Our
downside case is ~7.9x '23E EPS.

Commercial lines underlying CR of 88.3% in 1Q22 is on track to meet HIG's 2022E outlook range
of 86.5%-88.5% and HIG's personal lines underlying CR of 88.5% in 1Q22 is ahead of its 2022E
outlook range of 90-92%. From a seasonality perspective, however, the first quarter has better
auto results. Group Benefits 0.5% core earnings margin and 5.7% ex COVID in 1Q22 lagged the
2022E outlook ranges (3.1-5.4% inc. COVID and 6-7% ex COVID) in the quarter. Share
repurchases were ahead of our estimate in 1Q22 ($400mn actual vs. our $325mn estimate). As
such, we trimmed our 2022 buyback estimates to align with the remaining $900mn available
under its buyback authorization through 2022.
We are modeling better commercial lines premiums in 2022 than HIG's plan (BARC: 11% vs. HIG:
4-5%).

Personal Lines - Up 5.8% Q/Q, Expected to be Flat to
Slightly Down in '22
Personal lines written premiums decreased by 1% y/y, HIG is pushing rate increases and
focusing on its Prevail roll out. On the auto side, HIG received an average 6.2% rate increase on
its 50 auto filings/half its book. A notable achievement; still, we think more rate is needed.
During 1Q22, HIG's auto renewal pricing increases were 2.9%, slightly up from 2.6% in 4Q21 and
1.8% in 1Q21. The renewal written price increases in homeowners climbed to 8.8% in 1Q22 after
staying flat at +8.1% in 4Q21 to 3Q21.
While HIG is taking action on repricing its inforce on renewal business, the company's ongoing
rollout of its personal lines auto and home product (Prevail) is dampening its PIF decline trend.
Prevail has been rolled out to 13 states to date, including FL and TX, and is expected to be in
more than 40 states by the end of 2022. The combination of seasonality, rate increases, and
Prevail roll out contributed to a sequential 5.8% increase in personal NPW.

Personal Underwriting Performance
The auto underlying combined ratio of 93.3% was up 7 pts y/y yet it improved sequentially by
12.1 pts (see Figure 3). HIG saw higher than expected severity, most evident in physical damage.
We recognize that part of auto performance is seasonality, with its loss ratio running lower on
average in 1Q vs. the year.
2 May 2022

Barclays | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
The homeowners underlying combined ratio of 77.4% was up 0.2 pts y/y and 2.3 pts q/q. Note,
HIG experienced favorable non-cat weather frequency in homeowners. Otherwise HIG did not
see a shift in loss trends in homeowners in 1Q22 vs. 1Q21. HIG acknowledged pressure on claim
severity from higher building material and labor costs.
Underlying Commercial Margin - Room for
Improvement?
Commercial lines underlying margin improved ~2.9 pts y/y and 0.6 pts q/q. HIG is targeting
commercial lines underlying combined ratio of 86.5%- 88.5% in 2022 (BARC estimate 86.9%). We
see most of the improvements coming from the expense ratio side reflecting execution of
Hartford Next.
Segment Underlying Results:
· Middle & Large Commercial underlying combined ratio of 91.5% improved y/y by 3.8 pts
yet deteriorated by 1.5 pts q/q.
· Small Commercial underlying combined ratio at 85.9% improved by 2.4 pts y/y and 2.1 pts
q/q.
· Global Specialty underlying combined ratio of 88.2% improved y/y by 1.7 pts y/y and 0.6
pts q/q.
Commercial Pricing from Here
U.S. Standard Commercial Lines renewal written pricing steady, HIG reiterated that rates
continue to exceed loss trend across most products. Ex workers' compensation pricing was
7.1%. Companies have different definitions of pricing. TRV breaks out pricing and exposure
growth. When we asked HIG to define its exposure growth, we were told that, relative to the
7.1%, which was ex workers' compensation pricing in the quarter, 1.5 points of that, plus or
minus, came from exposure. It sounds like HIG considers a component of exposure to act like
rate.
HIG has recast its pricing presentation including prior periods and we have thus refreshed our
data collection. For instance in 4Q21, HIG called out 6.5% standard commercial ex WC pricing,
now recast as 8.0% for that period. We understand that HIG now blends all its commercial
segments, including global specialty, in its reference to commercial/commercial ex WC pricing.

our estimated $104mn) and $9mn of pre-tax COVID-19 related short term disability claims.
The group benefits core earnings margin adjusted for pandemic excess mortality and COVID-19
ST disability losses was 5.7%, below its guided range of 6-7%; however, from a seasonality
perspective, the 1Q results tend to be worse for LTD. HIG recognized $15-20mn of elevated
mortality claims in its AD&D book and waiver book. We found HIG's comments interesting with
respect to motor accidents making its group benefits more correlated to its personal lines book
than we expected.
HIG shared early CDC data in their presentation that points to non-COVID excess mortality
trending down in recent months, which would somewhat counter HIG's elevated 1Q ex COVID
results. Based on our conversation with HIG, this trend is not what HIG is seeing; rather, it is a
data point from CDC. We also think CDC data on ex-COVID deaths is on a significant lag, and will
take time to fully populate.
HIG's disability loss ratio deteriorated by 4.8 points y/y to 73.2%. With respect to long term
disability, HIG is seeing modestly higher incidence levels that did not come as a surprise/is
being priced. HIG is seeing a modest amount of claims coming from long COVID.
Expenses have moderately accelerated in the quarter to reflect higher staffing costs to manage
elevated short-term disability claims. Likewise, HIG is accelerating investments in capabilities,
including digital, claims automation and administrative platforms.
While the COVID death toll rose in 1Q22 vs. 4Q21, we are seeing a shift in the distribution of
COVID deaths amongst age cohorts that impact group benefits business. COVID deaths under
the age of 65 dropped to 24% in 1Q22 from 35% in 4Q and 42% in 3Q (avg. claim severity is 4x
higher for someone under 65 years of age vs. over 65 years of age).

Forward Looking Commentary
· In Group Benefits, premium growth is expected to be in the 2% range compared to 2021.
2 May 2022

Barclays | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
· COVID-19: In 2022, HIG is estimating between $125mn to $225mn of pre-tax losses within
group benefits, with the majority of the impact in the first half of 2022.
. Core Margins are expected to be in the 6%-7% range, which is consistent with the long-term
margin outlook. Core ROE is expected to be in the range of 13% to 14% in 2022 and
continuing into 2023.
. As of March 31, 2022, there was $898mn of the share repurchase authorization remaining for
2022. Additionally, from April 1-27, HIG has repurchased 1.9mn common shares for a total
of $139mn.
. HIG redeemed $600mn of 7.875% hybrid securities, prefunded with the issuance of 2.9%
$600mn senior notes in September '21. Accordingly, HIG's annual debt servicing costs are
down by $24mn. Furthermore, HIG will recognize a a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of
$9mn for unamortized debt issuance costs.
· Dividends from subsidiaries are expected to be between $1.7bn to $1.8bn in 2022.
. HIG thinks there is upside to its targeted Commercial lines premium growth of 4% and 5%
and reiterated its commercial underlying combined ratio between 86.5% and 88.5% for
2022.
· Commercial lines renewal written premium, excluding workers comp, is expected to run in
the mid-single digits, while Global Specialty lines of wholesale and U.S. Marine will be closer
to double digits.
. Personal Lines underlying combined ratio is expected to be in the range of 90% to 92% in
2022.
· LP long term normalized return in the 8% to 10% range.
Model Updates
Model Updates: We incorporated the following model changes post 1Q22. Share repurchases
were ahead of our estimate in 1Q22 ($400mn actual vs. $325mn estimate). As such, we trimmed
our 2022 buyback estimate to align with the remaining $900mn available under its buyback
authorization through 2022. While seasonality helped 1Q auto results, we think our original
projections were still too conservative and have slightly improved our outlook with our
underlying loss ratio estimates. Lastly, we were previously modeling a steady decline in book
yields, now we are modeling a modest reverse resulting in somewhat higher NII.
We reiterate our Overweight rating on HIG and our PT of $86 based on a 50/50 weighted 12x
$8.24 (up from $7.98) '23E EPS and 1.2x (down from 1.3x) 2023E book value per share ex AOCI of
$59.7 (up from $59.1).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $86 price target on HIG is based on a 50/50 weighted 12x $8.24 '23E EPS and 1.2x $59.7 2023E book value per share ex
AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.
