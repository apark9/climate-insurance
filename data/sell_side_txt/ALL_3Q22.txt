Allstate Corp.
3Q Review: Stressing Capital Levels
As ALL is moderating the pace of its buybacks, we continue to
get asked if these actions are enough. As such we performed
two stress scenarios.

Unchanged
In follow up per our note: Allstate Corp .: 'Proactive' Capital Management 03 Nov '22, ALL does
not measure capital on crude premiums to surplus levels. Likewise, RBC is just a checkpoint.
ALL's enterprise capital framework comprises both holding company assets and statutory
capital on an economic basis.

Capital Stress Test Conclusions:
1. AIC RBC to fall to 236-264% by 4Q23E from 318% in 4Q21. While ALL does not manage to
a certain RBC threshold, we think any level <250% is aggressive.
2. Holding Co. Liquidity to remain well above its $1.3bn annual fixed charges (common &
preferred dividends and after-tax debt servicing) at YE23.
Scenarios:
· Scenario 1: Subsidiary dividends equal to quarterly fixed charge servicing of $325mn, No
Statutory Earnings
· Scenario 2: No Subsidiary Dividends, No Statutory Earnings

. Assumptions: AIC received an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.25bn from ALIC on
November 1, 2021 immediately prior to ALIC's sale. Likewise, ALL attributes $1.7bn of
deployable capital post ALIC/ALNY deals reflecting a lower risk profile. We include these
sums in our calculation of P&C capital. We assume ALL completes the $1.2bn remaining on
its buyback program from 4Q22E-3Q23E at $300mn a quarter and pause thereafter. Finally,
we assume ALL will not fully utilize its statutory dividend capacity.

Limitations:
· We did not raise the denominator in RBC to reflect premium growth given that, on balance,
ALL has taken some investment de-risking actions since YE21. Note, ALL does not disclose
its RBC for AIC, but it does provide the components of the numerator ($18.43bn) and
denominator (2x $2.9bn) at YE21.
· Holding Co should generate NII on its assets, we are not modeling.
· Likewise since ALL thinks 30% of its investments are consumed by its economic capital, we
should really be applying a 30% haircut to Hold Co assets so it is truly "economic" capital.
· Finally, negative marks on Hold Co assets can add variability to projections.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
ALL's fundamentals are strong and
we look forward to seeing progress
on its transformative growth plan.
However, pricing correction actions
may stall ALL's progress in
actualizing stronger PIF growth.
Upside case
USD 137.00
Loss cost trends abate, returning to
2019 baseline levels. Successful
execution of Allstate's
transformational growth plans via
efficiency gains that is translated to
strong PIF growth, particularly in
auto. Our upside case of $137
assumes ~2.0x our '23 BVPS ex AOCI
estimate.
Downside case
USD 108.00
Steeper acceleration of loss cost
trends, particularly on the severity
side. Prolonged period of achieving
approvals from regulators with
respect to requested rate increases.
Our downside case of $108 assumes
~13x our '23 EPS estimates

3Q22 Highlights
With bodily injury on the rise, auto is looking more like a medium tail line. While we think ALL is
taking the right course of underwriting actions, but do not preclude some adverse PYD in the
near term.
Differing bodily injury views (ALL BI +12% y/y vs. PGR +7% y/y in its pre-pandemic range of 6-
8%). According to ALL, paid severity for major injury claims in litigation are 3.9x > the average.
After the pandemic PGR saw more soft tissue attorney representations.
ALL pre-announced several key underwriting performance measures (see Allstate Corp .: Model
Update: Unfavorable PYD, Consecutive and More Extreme 20 Oct 22).
ALL is ramping up its efforts to reduce personal lines insurance where margins are
unacceptable. ALL is exiting commercial and shared economy insurance markets that comprise
55% of commercial premiums. With less scale, we would like to better understand ALL's long-
term commitment.
Auto Loss trends:
· Severity for collision and bodily injury +17% and +12%, respectively, y/y. In comparison,
PGR's severity trends run lower at collision and bodily injury coverage increases of 13% and
12%, respectively, y/y. ALL took up its view of loss trend this quarter, to recap in 2Q it viewed
collision, and bodily injury up 16% and 9%.
. Severity for property damage of 17% y/y trails PGR's sentiment of 24% y/y. ALL is seeing
higher third party carrier subrogation demands by $ paid, that does not appear to be
subsiding. In fact, physical damage costs, informed by used car values, remain above
earned pricing. Last quarter ALL characterized property damage severity at a relatively
lower benchmark at +12%.
· Frequency: Property damage gross claim frequency +3.5% y/y, vs. +7.1% y/y reported in
2Q22.
Pricing
ALL is pushing for larger rate increases in the balance of the year and through 2023 to combat
future loss cost increases, critical for the company to achieve mid 90s combined ratio target.
PIF Growth
· ALL auto brand PIF remained flattish
· NatGen auto PIF +15%, consistent with its plans to grow non-standard auto.
Key Results
ALL's 3Q22 operating EPS of ($1.56) was in line with our ($1.56) estimate and better than the
($1.59) consensus street estimate. Buybacks of $665mn were higher than our estimate of
$625mn.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life
AIG, Inc. (AIG)

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within

applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.

Valuation Methodology: Our $128 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended ~12x our 2023 & 2024 EPS and 1.7x our YE23& 2024
book value per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.
