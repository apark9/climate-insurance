Arch reported mixed 3Q24 results as weakness in the reinsurance business
offset upside in MI and insurance. Our long-term outlook for ACGL remains
positive and we view it as the best name for investors seeking to take advantage of
the hard reinsurance market. Still, concerns about optimistic EPS estimates and
valuation keep us Neutral on the stock.
· EPS beat consensus, but below our forecasts; maintaining estimates.
ACGL announced 3Q24 operating EPS of $1.99, above consensus of $1.95, but
below our $2.14 estimate. The shortfall to our model was driven by higher cat
losses (-$0.53 worse), primarily in the reinsurance business, which more than
offset lower re/insurance attritional losses and stronger than assumed MI
results. Management attributed the uptick in cat losses primarily to
international events, partly given the location of large cats and in part due to
Arch's expanded presence in foreign markets. Unlike U.S. and Bermuda
business, where reinsurance attachment points have increased, Arch
participates in foreign treaties on a pro rata basis. Still, the cat load in the
reinsurance business was at the highest level in the past two years. This, along
with strong margins in MI, are the key drivers of us maintaining EPS forecasts.
· Business fundamentals were strong overall. Reinsurance results were
pressured by high cat losses (19.3 points on CR vs. our 9.0% assumption),
which more than offset strong underlying margins (CR ex. cats and PYD 74.8%
vs. 80.2%E). Insurance division earnings beat due to stronger premiums.
Insurance margins were close to our expectation on a reported basis (CR 93.2%
vs. 93.1%E) and better on a core basis (89.0% vs. 91.0%E). As in recent
quarters, MI margins were robust (CR 15.0% vs. 20.9%E), helped by reserve
releases on recent years. Consistent with our assumption, Arch did not
repurchase stock in 3Q. Management's tone on business trends was positive.
. We expect ACGL's results to be strong in the near term, but our long-term
outlook is less upbeat. Our model projects ACGL to report robust margins, but
modest top-line growth in its reinsurance and mortgage insurance businesses.
Reinsurance margins should benefit from the uptick in prices and favorable
terms (higher attachment points, lack of aggregate covers), while MI margins
should be helped by elevated house prices and the strong labor market. Top line
growth should be strong in the primary insurance business, but weak in MI.
Meanwhile, we do not expect ACGL to repurchase shares given its stock price.
Moreover, despite our near-term optimism, we do not expect margins in the
reinsurance or MI businesses to sustain at recent levels in the long run.
J.P Morgan
· We rate Arch Neutral. In our view, ACGL is a top-tier franchise, but in
commoditized markets. Hard reinsurance pricing and favorable housing and
labor market conditions should enable Arch to generate strong results in the
near term, but we do not expect the company's margins and ROE to sustain at
recent levels in the long run. Moreover, we feel that ACGL's valuation is not
attractive given its long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We rate Arch Neutral. Arch is a leading re/insurance franchise
with a track record of higher and less volatile underwriting
margins than most peers. Hard pricing and tighter terms/
conditions should boost underwriting results in the reinsurance
business in the near term. Meanwhile, near-term results in the MI
business should benefit from low attritional losses and reserve
releases. On the other hand, our long-term outlook for the
reinsurance market is cautious. This, along with current
valuation, keeps us Neutral on ACGL.

We rate ACGL Neutral given bullish sentiment and valuation, but we consider it
the best stock for investors seeking exposure to the firm reinsurance pricing theme.
Arch is an industry-leading reinsurance franchise with a unique culture and approach to
underwriting that should generate above-average, and less volatile, margins over time.
The company is also a leading mortgage insurer, a business that we believe is
structurally better than P&C reinsurance. In primary P&C, Arch has expanded its
position in wholesale/E&S through the current hard market and the acquisition of
MidCorp should bolster its middle market franchise. Our near term outlook for Arch is
upbeat, and we expect its results to benefit from firm prices and tight terms/conditions
in re/insurance as well as ongoing reserve releases in mortgage insurance. However, our
longer term is more muted and we expect reinsurance prices to soften over the next 1-2
years if underwriting margins stay close to recent levels. The reinsurance market suffers
from structural issues such as low barriers to entry, lack of differentiation among
carriers, and limited pricing power, all of which suggest more competition if margins
stay elevated. Furthermore, investor sentiment on ACGL seems very bullish, and we
feel that the stock's valuation already reflects optimism for near-term results. Still, our
fundamental outlook for the company remains constructive and we could get more
bullish on the stock if it pulls back.
P&C Reinsurance: Firm Pricing to Lift Near-Term Results
In our view, ongoing firm pricing and terms will drive robust margins in the
reinsurance business over the next year. ACGL has historically generated better and
less volatile margins than most reinsurers because of its focus on specialty business
(where pricing is less competitive), conservative underwriting, ability to shift mix with
changing conditions, and judicious management of catastrophe risk. In addition, ACGL
prices business using the risk-free rate (leading to conservative pricing), deploys a long-
term compensation plan for underwriters based on margins over multiple years, and
supplements re/insurance underwriting earnings with fee income from 3rd party capital
vehicles such as Premia. Still, our long-term outlook for reinsurance remains
cautious because of its commoditized nature, the ease of entry of new capital, and a
broad set of capital providers (including some, such as pension funds, with lower return
thresholds). We are skeptical of prolonged hard pricing and believe that 1-2 years of
strong margins will likely erode pricing discipline. As such, we anticipate an eventual
softening of pricing and terms, especially in higher reinsurance layers, which are
attracting more capital. Any signs of softening of terms/conditions or new capacity will
likely hurt sentiment on reinsurance stocks, which are consensus longs.
MI: Margins to Normalize Lower, Growth Modest
ACGL grew in mortgage insurance via acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and United Guaranty
in 2016) when market conditions were favorable, marked by rising home prices,
stringent lending standards, and disciplined pricing by MI carriers. Arch's MI business
has generated healthy margins since then and, despite the temporary setback from
COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have been strong. We expect MI margins
to be strong in the next few quarters, but normalize over time as reserve releases taper
off. Results in the next few quarters should benefit from ACGL's conservative loss picks
post-COVID, the strong labor market, and the increase house prices. Meanwhile, lower
rates bode well for new sales, although they should weigh on persistency.

3Q24 Details
Yesterday evening, Arch reported third quarter 2024 operating EPS of $1.99, above
consensus of $1.95, but below our $2.14 estimate. The shortfall to our model was driven
by higher cat losses (-$0.53 worse), primarily in the reinsurance business, which more
than offset lower re/insurance attritional losses and stronger than assumed MI results.
By division, MI results beat on strong margins, insurance earnings were lifted by upside
in premiums, and reinsurance results fell short on high cat losses.

no major unusual items
Business trends were healthy overall. Reinsurance results were pressured by high cat
losses (19.3 points on CR vs. our 9.0% assumption), which more than offset strong
underlying margins (CR ex. cats and PYD 74.8% vs. 80.2%E). Insurance division
earnings beat due to stronger premiums. Insurance margins were close to our
expectation on a reported basis (CR 93.2% vs. 93.1%E) and better on a core basis
(89.0% vs. 91.0%E). As in recent quarters, MI margins were robust (CR 15.0% vs.
20.9%E), helped by reserve releases on recent years. Investment income was better than
expected as well, and benefited from assets acquired as part of the MidCorp deal.
Consistent with our assumption, Arch did not repurchase stock in the third quarter.

Mortgage Ins .: Robust Margins Lifted Earnings
We forecast the mortgage insurance (MI) business to report modest premium
growth, high persistency, and robust (albeit normalizing) margins. Higher interest
rates are a headwind for mortgage insurance volumes, while reserve releases should
moderate over time. Still, MI results have been significantly above expectations in
recent periods and we feel that there is a greater chance of upside to our prospective
forecasts than downside. In addition, earned premium growth should benefit from
higher retention following the cancelation of the Bellemeade transactions, while a
decline in rates should be a positive for new business volumes.
In 3Q24, the MI business generated underwriting income of $269 million, well above
our $217 million estimate, driven by better margins (CR 15.0% vs. 20.9%E) and higher
earned premium growth (+6.8% vs. - 7.4%E). The upside in margins resulted from
higher reserve releases (-22.8% vs. - 20.0%E), a lower attritional loss ratio (22.5% vs.
24.0%E), and a lower expense ratio (15.3% vs. 16.9%E). Similar to 2Q24, the company
attributed the reserve releases to favorable cure rates (primarily on mortgages issued at
attractive rates in the past few years). On a negative note, the attritional loss ratio was
higher than the 3Q23 level, which management noted was due to higher delinquencies.
Gross premiums were lackluster (12th consecutive quarter of decline), but net written
and net earned premium growth benefited from the termination of the Bellemeade
agreements in 4Q23. We believe that the factors boosting margins in the Mortgage
Insurance business (higher rates, lower inventory of houses, etc.) will continue
suppressing gross premium growth.

In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were hurt by artificially high delinquencies caused
by homeowners availing themselves of government forbearance programs. However,
after an initial spike in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has been steadily
declining. Following the expiry of forbearance programs, a significant portion of
previously delinquent loans have cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were
taking advantage of the mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial distress. In
addition, higher house prices have provided a cushion to homeowners under stress who
are struggling to pay their mortgages, limiting losses for MI carriers. The percent of
loans in default in the U.S. primary MI business was 1.96% at 9/30/2024, up from
1.82% at 6/30/2024 and 1.65% at 9/30/23.

We expect reserve releases to continue to lift MI margins, although the tailwind
should moderate over time. Higher reported delinquencies at the onset of COVID led
Arch and its MI peers to establish corresponding reserves despite the healthy labor
market and appreciation in house prices. A meaningful portion of these delinquencies
represented homeowners taking advantage of the government's forbearance protection
programs (to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship. Thus, actual losses
ultimately came in well below those suggested by initial delinquencies, allowing ACGL
to release reserves. In more recent quarters, over 80% of MI reserves have been from
accident years after COVID, suggesting a waning benefit from COVID-related reserve
releases. Even with this decline, however, we expect MI margins to remain healthy
given the strong labor and housing markets, cures on previously delinquent loans, and
the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due to the appreciation in house prices.
Higher interest rates are a positive for margins as well, as they are causing homeowners
to stay longer in their existing houses (where they have more equity), thereby improving
persistency. On a cautious note, top-line growth in the MI business is likely to stay weak
as higher interest rates reduce mortgage originations. Although a weaker economy could
deflate home prices and lead to higher mortgage defaults, a material uptick in losses
seems unlikely in the near term. Barring a recession, we expect core margins to stay
healthy, though declining reserve releases will drive margins and earnings lower even if
economic trends stay favorable.

ACGL has become a leading competitor in the MI market through acquisitions,
and could expand further via M&A, but we do not anticipate deals in the near
term. ACGL entered the mortgage re/insurance business in 2011, but was only
marginally involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through
credit unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The
company's 2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a
bigger foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at
S&P) and gained distribution in the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch became a
top 10 competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market position
strengthened further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from
AIG, which catapulted it to a top-3 spot (as part of the deal AIG retained 50% of
mortgage insurance blocks originated by UGC pre 2017). Arch has also expanded in
foreign MI markets through M&A, including its acquisition of Westpac's mortgage
insurance business in Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Results Lifted by the MidCorp Deal
The insurance business reported higher premium growth and an in-line combined
ratio. The insurance division generated underwriting income of $120 million in 3Q24,
above our $107 million estimate. Margins were relatively consistent with our estimates
on a reported basis (CR 93.2% vs. 93.1%E), but better on a core basis (CR ex. cats and
PYD 89.0% vs. 91.0%E). Lower expenses (31.6% vs. 35.5%E) and higher reserve
releases (-0.7% vs. - 0.4%E) were offset by higher catastrophe losses (4.9% vs. 2.5%E)
and higher attritional losses (57.4% vs. 55.5%E). Gross written premium growth
(+14.6% vs. +10.0%E), net written premium growth (+19.6% vs. +9.4%E), and net
earned premium growth (+25.0% vs. +9.6%E) were significantly higher than expected.
The expense ratio benefited from acquisition accounting (acquisition expense on the
MidCorp block, a component of the expense ratio, was replaced with purchase
intangibles, the amortization of which is reflected in the consolidated income statement
but not in the combined ratio).

Arch's primary P&C business is benefiting from healthy pricing, but we think
further margin expansion is unlikely. After shrinking its "cycle managed" business
(now called wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to 2017, ACGL is seeing strong
growth in this part of its primary book, driven by favorable conditions in the broader
market, particularly in E&S. Results in less opportunistic parts of ACGL's book
(specialty small/middle market and franchise) have been healthy as well. Despite the
favorable market environment, we do not anticipate a material improvement in primary
commercial lines margins at Arch and peers because of headwinds from higher inflation
and reinsurance costs. Also, price increases have slowed for select lines (particularly in
property), and reserve development could become less of a tailwind because of adverse
loss trends emerging in older accident years. Management teams at insurance
underwriters as well as many investors are optimistic about improving non-cat margins
at commercial insurers. However, we feel that assessing results on a non-cat basis is
not as relevant given the significant increase in reinsurance retentions at primary
companies. On an overall combined ratio basis, results for most primary insurers were
weak in 2023, precisely because of elevated cat losses. In contrast, reinsurers' cat losses
have not increased to the same extent. In our view, consensus EPS forecasts for
commercial lines insurers do not fully reflect the shift in cat loads from reinsurers to
primary carriers following the uptick in retention levels with 2023 reinsurance renewals.
Reinsurance: High Catastrophe Losses Drove Miss
ACGL's reinsurance business reported higher than expected catastrophe losses,
but healthy premium growth. Underwriting income in 3Q24 was $149 million, well
below our $258 million estimate, marked by lower reported margins (CR 92.2% vs.
86.0%E). The downside in margins was driven primarily by higher catastrophe losses
(19.3% vs. 9.0%E) and, to a lesser extent, lower reserve releases (-1.9% vs. - 3.2%E).
These were partly offset by a lower attritional loss ratio (52.2% vs. 55.7%E) and a lower
expense ratio (22.6% vs. 24.5%E). On a core basis, margins were better than assumed
(CR ex. cats and PYD 74.8% vs. 80.2%E). Premium growth was strong (gross written
premiums +29.2% vs. +20.0%E, net written premiums +24.5% vs. 19.9%E, net earned
premiums +22.6% vs. 19.3%E). Management was upbeat on Arch's positioning in the
property cat market despite pricing moderation from last year. The increase in
reinsurance attachment points in early 2023 shifted the risk of cat losses from reinsurers
to primary carriers, and management indicated that terms remain consistent. Arch
indicated that Helene accounted for less than half of its cat losses in 3Q24, and a greater
proportion of its claims were driven by international events (Canada hailstorms, Europe
floods, and Asia typhoons) given its increased presence in foreign markets. Unlike in
the U.S./Bermuda, where reinsurance attachment points have increased, Arch
participates in many international treaties on a pro rata basis and has more exposure to
losses in lower layers of reinsurance programs.

We are skeptical of a sustained hard market, but Milton bodes well for near-term
renewals and ACGL seems better positioned than peers in this environment.
ACGL's reinsurance segment was initially established to take advantage of the hard
market for casualty coverage in the early 2000s. Over the years, however, management
has shifted Arch Re's business mix away from casualty risks towards other specialty
lines such as surety, accident and health, agriculture, and trade credit, which are
generally less competitive and have more attractive risk-reward. The hard pricing
environment has boosted results in recent years and has led management to increase
exposure to property coverages, which in turn have contributed to strong premium
growth and margins. Longer term, however, we remain skeptical of a sustained hard
reinsurance market and expect the pace of price hikes to moderate. Factors that
contributed to a multi-year soft market prior to 2018 (glut of capital, greater fluidity/
speed of capital, more providers of capacity, broker consolidation) are still prevalent,
and should preclude prolonged hard pricing. On a positive note, ACGL's reinsurance
results could benefit from the release of COVID-related reserves, a portion of which
remain in IBNR. Similarly, loss reserves for Ian and other cat events could ultimately
prove to be too conservative.
Maintaining EPS Estimates
We are maintaining our 4Q24 and 2025 operating EPS forecasts at $2.35 and $8.69,
respectively. Our estimates for 2025 and beyond are below consensus levels, which we
feel are too optimistic. We consider catastrophe losses (which would affect reinsurance
and insurance margins) and housing market conditions (which affect MI margins and
premium growth) the key sources of potential upside or downside in reported results
versus our projections.

Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $110.00)
Investment Thesis
We view Arch as a premier re/insurance franchise, but bullish investor sentiment and
valuation keep us from being more positive on the stock. ACGL is a leading reinsurance
business that we project to report superior and less volatile underwriting margins over time
given its unique culture and approach to the market. Also, Arch is a top competitor in
mortgage insurance (MI), which we consider a structurally better business than P&C
reinsurance. In the near term, we expect MI results to be marked by improving premium
growth and healthy margins, with reserve releases more than offsetting higher attritional
losses. In reinsurance, firm pricing should boost both premium growth and margins as well.
However, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance business is downbeat. We believe that
structural issues such as low barriers to entry, lack of differentiation by carrier, and limited
pricing power will drive a softening of reinsurance prices if margins stay close to recent
levels over the next one to two years. Also, investor sentiment on ACGL is bullish and the
stock's valuation does not seem compelling relative to the company's long-term ROE and
EPS growth potential.
Valuation
We are maintaining our December 2025 price target of $110. Our price target assumes
a 1.8x multiple on our 12/31/25E BV ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.8x multiple on our 12/31/25E
BV forecast, and an 11.0x multiple on our 2026 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this
approach with a sum-of-the-parts analysis that values ACGL's re/insurance business
separately from mortgage insurance. Our target multiples for ACGL reflect its current
business mix, which has become less skewed to MI. ACGL trades at 1.8x BV and 12.1x
2025E EPS compared to 1.4x and 8.3x for the reinsurance sector, 1.3x and 8.8x for MI peers,
and 2.0x and 11.8x for the broader P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for a prolonged period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. In
our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, even as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
· Arch announces a sizable share repurchase program. Steady repurchases by leading
reinsurers could help prolong the hard market as well as drive an uptick in EPS forecasts.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· Additional capacity enters the reinsurance market. This, in turn, could result in a
reversal in pricing trends and potentially drive a reduction in EPS estimates as well as
hurt sentiment on the sector.
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
· The tailwind from reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development
has been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in the pace

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); Neutral (over
the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the
Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's team's, coverage universe); and Underweight (over the duration of the price target indicated in
this report, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst's, or the Research Analyst's
team's, coverage universe. NR is Not Rated. In this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap Equity Research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark
country market index, not to those Research Analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying Research Analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's Research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
Coverage Universe: Bhullar, Jimmy S: AFLAC, Inc. (AFL), Allstate (ALL), American International Group (AIG), Aon (AON), Arch Capital
(ACGL), Brighthouse Financial (BHF), Chubb Ltd (CB), Corebridge Financial (CRBG), Equitable Holdings Inc (EQH), Globe Life Inc (GL),
Hartford Financial Services (HIG), Lincoln National (LNC), Marsh & McLennan (MMC), MetLife, Inc. (MET), Principal Financial Group
