Arch Capital
Momentum in Insurance and MI Drove Strong 2Q22
Results
ACGL reported strong 2Q22 results and we are raising our EPS forecasts.
We consider Arch a strong franchise but remain Neutral on the stock due
to a cautious outlook for the reinsurance market.
· EPS upside; raising estimates. ACGL reported operating EPS of $1.34,
well above our $1.10 estimate and consensus of $1.09. Results were
lifted by better than assumed reserve development ($0.12 better), but
earnings would have beaten expectations regardless, helped by upside in
premiums and investment income. We are raising our 3Q22 estimate
from $0.98 to $0.99 and our 2023 projection from $4.78 to $4.86.
· Business trends were healthy. Compared with our model, earnings beat
in the P&C insurance and MI divisions, but missed in reinsurance.
Margins were better than expected on a reported basis (combined ratio
77.1% vs. 80.1%E) and on a core basis (CR ex. cats and PYD 80.7% vs.
81.3%E). Margins were especially strong in the insurance and MI
businesses, but were weaker in reinsurance. Reserve development was
better than anticipated (due to the MI and insurance division), while cat
losses were roughly in-line. Meanwhile, investment income beat and
should benefit from the rise in interest rates. Written premiums rose
12%, significantly higher than our 1% assumption. ACGL spent
$321 million on share buybacks, above our $200 million assumption.
. Our fundamental outlook is relatively upbeat. We project the
company's results in the near term to be marked by healthy MI and
re/insurance margins, strong re/insurance premiums, and weak MI
premiums. Longer term, we anticipate healthy returns in the MI
business, which generates the majority of ACGL's underwriting
earnings. However, the tailwind from reserve releases in the MI business
should moderate in 2023 and margins should compress given the
commoditized nature of the business, black box pricing, and higher
capital requirements. Meanwhile, our long-term view of the reinsurance
market remains downbeat, and we expect excess capacity, more 3rd party
participation, increased mobility of capital, and broker consolidation to
preclude a sustained hard market. ACGL has ample capacity to
supplement organic growth with steady share repurchases, but we expect
the pace of buybacks to moderate from recent levels.
Morgan
· We affirm our Neutral rating. We consider Arch a top-tier franchise,
but in commoditized markets. Over time, ACGL has transitioned into
more of an MI firm than a P&C reinsurer. Our long-term outlook for the
MI business is relatively upbeat, but we are cautious on the reinsurance
market. Also, we feel that ACGL's valuation is not too enticing given
the company's long-term ROE and growth profile.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premier franchise and expect it to
generate higher and less volatile underwriting margins than
most peers. However, we remain Neutral on the stock given a
cautious long-term outlook for the P&C reinsurance market. In
our view, near-term results in the MI and re/insurance
businesses will benefit from the economic recovery, a healthy
housing market, and firm re/insurance pricing. Meanwhile, our
long-term outlook is mixed as we expect MI returns to be held
back by commoditized nature of the product, black box
pricing, and higher capital requirements. Moreover, we remain
negative on the P&C reinsurance business, and forecast excess
capacity, greater third-party participation, increased mobility
of capital, and consolidation among brokers to preclude
sustained hard market.

In our view, ACGL is a premier franchise, but we remain Neutral given our
cautious long-term outlook for the reinsurance market. We believe that ACGL
has an industry-leading reinsurance business with a unique culture and approach to
underwriting that should generate superior returns and less volatile margins over
time. In the primary P&C business, ACGL has grown premiums and improved
margins with the tailwind of favorable pricing. Arch has also established itself as a
top-tier competitor in mortgage insurance (MI), which we view as a structurally
better business than reinsurance. Although higher interest rates, a weaker economy,
and competition from the FHA are risks for the MI business, near-term results should
benefit from the release of reserves set up at the onset of COVID. Meanwhile, firm
pricing is a positive for P&C reinsurance and insurance results. On the other hand,
our long-term outlook for reinsurance is downbeat given structural headwinds in the
market (e.g., excess capital, low barriers to entry, limited pricing power, etc.). Also,
valuation is not too enticing given Arch's long-term ROE and growth potential.
Mortgage Insurance: Growth Poor, but Margins to be Strong
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance mainly through acquisitions (CMG in 2014
and United Guaranty in 2016) during a time when market conditions were favorable
overall, marked by appreciating home prices, relatively stringent lending standards at
mortgage issuers, and disciplined pricing by mortgage insurers. Arch's MI business
has generated healthy margins since these acquisitions, and despite the temporary
setback from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have been healthy
overall. We expect near-term results in the business to benefit from significant
reserve releases as loans delinquent at the onset of the pandemic become current on
payments. On a cautious note, higher interest rates should suppress mortgage
origination volumes and, while not imminent, a recession would drive an uptick in
defaults and thereby pressure margins in the MI business.
P&C Reinsurance: Long-Term Outlook Negative
We project ACGL's reinsurance margins to be higher and less volatile than
peers', but our long-term outlook for the market remains cautious. Arch has
historically produced stronger results than most other reinsurers, which we attribute
to its focus on specialty reinsurance (where pricing tends to be less competitive),
conservative underwriting philosophy, ability to shift target segments based on
changing market conditions, and judicious management of cat risk. In particular,
ACGL prices business using the risk-free rate (leading to more conservative
underwriting), and uses a long-term compensation plan for underwriters that pays
based on underwriting margins over a multi-year period. The creation of 3rd party
capital vehicles such as Premia Re has also allowed Arch to earn fee income from its
reinsurance franchise. Although we view Arch as a top-tier reinsurer, our long-term
outlook for the reinsurance market remains negative due to several structural
headwinds, including the commoditized nature of the product and the ease of entry of
new capital. Pricing remains firm overall, but we see the pace of price hikes
moderating over the next year, which could weigh on top-line growth and margins.
Furthermore, we believe that catastrophe risk has been systemically underpriced as
prices have not kept up with the increasing frequency and severity of cat events.

2Q22 Details
This evening, ACGL announced 2Q22 operating EPS of $1.34, exceeding our $1.10
estimate and consensus of $1.09. Results were lifted by better than assumed reserve
development ($0.12 per share better), but earnings would have beaten expectations
regardless, helped by upside in premiums and investment income. By division,
earnings beat in P&C insurance and MI, but missed in reinsurance.

Business trends were healthy overall. Underwriting margins were better than
expected on a reported basis (combined ratio 77.1% vs. 80.1%E) and on a core basis
(CR ex. cats and PYD 80.7% vs. 81.3%E). Margins were especially strong in the
P&C insurance and mortgage insurance businesses, but weaker than assumed in P&C
reinsurance. Reserve development was better than anticipated (due to the MI and

investment income beat and should benefit from the increase in interest rates. Written
premiums rose 12%, significantly higher than our 1% assumption. ACGL spent
$321 million on share repurchases in 2Q22, above our $200 million assumption.

Mortgage Ins .: Strong Results, Lifted by Reserve Releases
Our outlook for top-line growth in the MI business is downbeat, but we expect
margins to remain robust in the near term. The MI business reported underwriting
income of $298 million in 2Q22, well above our $268 million estimate, with upside
in margins (CR of -1.5% versus our 12.5% estimate) more than offsetting lower net
earned premiums (-11.5% vs. - 10.0%E). Margins were boosted by favorable
development on COVID-related reserves (-40.7% on the combined ratio versus our
estimate of -27.0%). Still, the combined ratio was better than assumed on a core basis
as well (CR ex. cats and PYD 39.2% vs. 39.5%E). Net written premiums declined
12.5% to $294 million, slightly better than our expectation, with the year-on-year
drop driven by lower gross written premiums and retention levels.
In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were hurt by artificially high delinquencies
attributable to homeowners availing themselves of government forbearance
programs. With the expiry of the programs, a significant portion of previously
delinquent loans have cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were taking
advantage of the mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial stress.
Meanwhile, for homeowners under stress who are truly unable to pay their
mortgages, the strong appreciation in house prices has provided a cushion, limiting
losses for mortgage insurers. After spiking in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans
has steadily declined, and we expect the trend to continue in the near term. This, in
turn, should drive robust margins in the MI division. The percent of loans in default
in the U.S. primary MI business was 1.8% at 6/30/22, an improvement from 2.1% at
3/31/22, 2.4% at 12/31/21, 2.7% at 9/30/2021, and 3.1% at 6/30/2021.

We expect MI margins to be robust and benefit from additional reserve
releases. Under U.S. GAAP accounting, Arch has to set reserves for its primary U.S.
MI business based on reported delinquencies (unlike for P&C lines, an IBNR
component is not permitted under U.S. GAAP for primary MI business). An increase
in reported delinquencies at the onset of COVID caused Arch and its MI peers to
establish corresponding reserves despite the healthy labor market and appreciation in
house prices. However, a meaningful portion of these delinquencies resulted from
homeowners taking advantage of the government's forbearance protection programs
(mainly to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship. As such, the majority of
these delinquent loans have actually cured following the expiration of forbearance
programs (initially set for 12/31/20, but then extended through 9/30/21 and, in some
cases, year-end 2021 or beyond), resulting in the release of previously incurred
reserves. The interplay of cures on previously delinquent loans and how new
delinquencies emerge in response to the economic environment, which is beginning
to soften, will be the key driver of MI margins through 2022 and 2023. Overall, we
project MI margins to remain robust given strong labor and housing markets, cures
on previously delinquent loans, and the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners
due to the appreciation in house prices. On a cautious note, top-line growth in the
business is likely to be sluggish as higher interest rates reduce mortgage originations.
Also, a weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead to higher defaults on
mortgages, particularly among borrowers that have weaker credit profiles.
ACGL has become a formidable competitor in the mortgage insurance market
through acquisitions and could expand further via M&A in the future. ACGL
entered the mortgage re/insurance business in 2011, but was only marginally
involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit
unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The
company's 2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it
a bigger foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to
A- at S&P) and gained distribution into the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch

became a top 10 competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market
position strengthened further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty
(UGC) from AIG, which catapulted the company to a top-3 competitor (as part of the
deal, AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance blocks originated by UGC prior to
2017). The company has also expanded its presence in foreign MI markets through
M&A, including its recent acquisition of Westpac's mortgage insurance business in
Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Margins Drove Upside, Growth Healthy
The insurance business reported strong premium growth and better than
expected margins. Underwriting income in 2Q22 was $98 million, well above our
$41 million estimate, driven by a lower combined ratio (91.1% versus our 96.3%
estimate) and better than expected premium growth. The underwriting margin
benefited from lower catastrophe losses (1.5% vs. 5.0%E) and higher favorable
development (-0.4% vs. - 0.3%E). Margins were better than assumed on a core basis
as well (CR ex. cats and PYD of 90.0% vs. 91.5%E). Similar to the past few
quarters, the expense ratio rose from the previous year due to a business mix shift to
lines such as travel and professional liability that have higher expense ratios but
lower loss ratios (the overall combined ratio improved from 2Q21). Top-line growth
was robust, with premiums rising 27.5% to $1.2 billion versus our 16.0% estimate.

ACGL has attractive opportunities in the primary P&C market, and our
outlook for premium growth and margins is constructive. After shrinking its
"cycle managed" business (now dubbed as wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to
2017, ACGL is seeing healthy growth in this part of its primary P&C book, driven by
price increases in the broader market, particularly E&S. This, coupled with consistent
performance in the less opportunistic parts of its book (specialty small/middle market
and franchise), should drive healthy results in the business. On a cautious note, we

believe that the market is past the midpoint of the current pricing cycle, and that
exposure growth could decelerate if the economy slows. Hence, while favorable
tailwinds in the insurance business should persist as premiums are earned, we expect
the pace of price increases on new business to moderate through 2022 and 2023.
Reinsurance: Cats Drove Miss; L-T Outlook Downbeat
Reinsurance results were marked by healthy premium growth but lower
earnings. Underwriting income in 2Q22 was $139 million, below our $150 million
estimate, mainly due to higher catastrophe losses ($66 million vs. $26 million
estimate). This, in turn, resulted in an elevated combined ratio (85.5% vs. 83.0%E).
On a core basis, underwriting margins were roughly in-line with a higher AY loss
ratio (55.3% vs. 55.0E%) mostly offset by a lower expense ratio (27.5% vs.
28.0%E). The company has paid marginal claims related to the Russia/Ukraine war
and virtually all Russia/Ukraine losses booked by ACGL thus far (for both insurance
and reinsurance businesses) are related to IBNR. Net written premium growth was
robust, up 25.7% to $1.2 billion, higher than our 9.5% expectation.

Our long-term outlook for the reinsurance market is cautious, but we expect
Arch Re to generate superior results compared to peers. ACGL's reinsurance
business was initially established to take advantage of the hard market for casualty
risk in the early 2000s. Over the years, however, management has shifted Arch Re's
business mix away from casualty coverage towards other specialty lines such as
surety, accident and health, agriculture, and trade credit, which are generally less
competitive and present more attractive risk-reward. Firming pricing has benefited
results in recent years and should drive continued strong premiums and margins in
the near term. Still, we expect the pace of price hikes to moderate and remain
skeptical of a sustained hard market given the industry's significant excess capacity
and additional capital entering the market. Factors that contributed to a multi-year

soft market prior to 2018 (glut of capital, greater fluidity/speed of capital, more
providers of capacity, broker consolidation) are still prevalent, and should preclude a
prolonged hard reinsurance market. On a positive note, results in the next 1-2 years
could benefit from the release of COVID-related business interruption reserves given
favorable court decisions in most cases thus far.
Raising EPS Estimates
We are increasing our 3Q22 EPS estimate from $0.98 to $$0.99 and our 2023
projection from $4.78 to $4.86. Our 2022 EPS forecast is increasing as well, from
$4.25 to $4.51, partly to reflect upside in 2Q22 results. Our updated model reflects
the benefit of better assumed margins in the insurance business, higher than
anticipated share buybacks in 2Q22 (and an ensuing lower share count for future
periods), and higher net investment income. In our view, catastrophe losses and
trends in the housing market (which would affect reserve releases) will be the key
sources of variance between reported results and our projections.
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Arch Capital Group Ltd. (Neutral; Price Target: $54.00)
Investment Thesis
We view Arch as a premiere franchise, but remain Neutral given our cautious
outlook for the reinsurance market. In our opinion, ACGL has an industry-leading
reinsurance business that we expect to deliver superior and less volatile underwriting
margins over time due to its unique culture and approach to the market. Also, Arch has
established itself as one of the top competitors in the mortgage insurance (MI) market,
which we consider a structurally better business to P&C reinsurance. In insurance,
ACGL has been able to grow premiums and improve margins, helped by the hard P&C
market. Our model projects near-term results in the MI business to benefit from reserve
releases. Additionally, firm P&C pricing should drive top-line growth and margins in
both the insurance and reinsurance segments. However, our long-term outlook for the
reinsurance business remains cautious due to structural issues facing the market,
including its excess capital position, relatively low barriers to entry, increased
participation by third-party capital providers, and limited pricing power. Moreover, we
believe that the stock's valuation is not too compelling given the company's long-term
ROE and EPS growth potential.
Valuation
We are raising our year-end 2023 price target from $53 to $54. Our price target
assumes a 1.4x multiple on our 12/31/23E BV ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.3x multiple on
our 12/31/23E BV forecast and an 11.0x multiple on our 2024 EPS estimate, and we
corroborate this approach with a sum-of-the-parts analysis that values ACGL's
re/insurance business separately from mortgage insurance. Our target multiples for
ACGL reflect its current business mix, which has become more skewed to mortgage

insurance. Although mortgage insurance continues to generate higher returns than
re/insurance, especially on legacy business from 2009 to 2016, we are concerned
about greater competition in the mortgage insurance market. ACGL trades at 1.4x
BV and 9.1x 2023E EPS compared to 1.1x and 7.1x for the reinsurance sector, 1.0x
and 6.3x for MI peers, and 1.4x and 11.4x for the broader P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· The pricing environment remains firm. Prices for most P&C lines have been
firm for the past several years. An extended hard market could drive upside to our
EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent
level. In our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain
insurance combined ratios in the low to mid-90s, a significant improvement from
~100% previously, as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
· Management remains proactive with share repurchases. ACGL has
repurchased more stock than expected in recent quarters, partly to take advantage
of its depressed trading multiples. A continuation of the trend could drive upward
revisions in EPS forecasts as well as boost sentiment on the stock.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to
mortgage insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk,
rising unemployment or higher mortgage defaults would pressure the company's
results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
. Price increases in the reinsurance market slow. Although primary and
reinsurance pricing has been improving since 2018, we do not anticipate
sustained hardening. A reversal in pricing trends could drive downside risk in
EPS estimates as well as dampen sentiment on the sector.
· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development
has been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in
the pace of development could pressure margins and returns.
· Cat losses stay elevated. While prices for cat re/insurance have hardened, the
frequency and severity of catastrophe losses has increased by a larger magnitude
over time. This implies that reinsurance prices need to increase significantly for
underwriters to earn adequate returns, especially in a scenario where cat losses
approximate those in the 2018-2020 period.

period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the
average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's)
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of
the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected
total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it
does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
