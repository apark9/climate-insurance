High Cat Losses Mar Otherwise Healthy Business
Trends
ACGL's results were hurt by elevated cat losses, but underlying
business trends were healthy. ACGL had pre-announced cat losses last
week, but we did not adjust our model following the announcement.
· EPS miss; raising estimates. ACGL reported operating EPS of $0.28
compared with our assumption of $0.71 and consensus of $0.23. The
shortfall to our model was driven by high cat losses (-$0.73 variance
after taxes), partly offset by higher favorable prior-year development
(+$0.17) and net investment income (+$0.10). We are raising our 4Q22
EPS forecast from $1.09 to $1.25 and our 2023 projection from $4.90 to
$5.30, primarily to reflect higher investment income (in 4Q22 and 2023)
as well as more favorable development in the MI business (in 4Q22).
· Underlying business trends were healthy. MI results were robust,
while insurance and reinsurance results were pressured by high cat
losses. Cats hurt reported margins (CR 97.3% vs. 88.3%E), but core
margins were close to our assumption (CR ex. cats and PYD 82.2% vs.
82.3%E). MI results were marked by sizable favorable development but
weak top-line growth. Insurance earnings were suppressed by cats, but
core margins and premium growth were better than assumed.
Reinsurance premiums were robust as well, but margins were poor (both
reported and core). Investment income was lifted by the rise in interest
rates. Written premiums rose 31%, above our 26% assumption. ACGL
spent $10 million on share buybacks, below our $200 million estimate.
. Our long-term outlook for ACGL is mixed. We expect ACGL's
results to be marked by healthy MI and re/insurance margins, strong
re/insurance premiums, and weak MI premiums. Longer term, we
project healthy returns in the MI business, which generates the majority
of ACGL's underwriting earnings. However, the tailwind from reserve
releases in the MI business should moderate in 2023, and we see
margins compressing given the commoditized nature of the business, its
black box pricing, and higher capital requirements. Conversely, despite
the current hard market, our long-term view of the reinsurance business
remains cautious given structural headwinds such as increased 3rd-party
participation, higher mobility of capital, and broker consolidation. Arch
has flexibility to supplement organic growth with share repurchases, but
we expect the pace of buybacks to slow from recent levels.
Morgan
. We maintain our Neutral rating. We consider Arch a top-tier
franchise, but in commoditized markets. Over time, ACGL has
transitioned into more of an MI firm than a P&C reinsurer. Our long-
term outlook for the MI business is upbeat, but we are cautious on the
reinsurance market. Also, we feel that ACGL's valuation is not too
enticing given the company's long-term ROE and growth profile.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premier franchise and expect it to
generate higher and less volatile underwriting margins than
most peers. However, we remain Neutral on the stock given a
cautious long-term outlook for the P&C reinsurance market. In
our view, near-term results in the MI and re/insurance
businesses will benefit from reserve releases on COVID MI
and BI claims as well as firm re/insurance pricing. Longer
term, however, our outlook is mixed as we expect MI returns
to be held back by the commoditized nature of the product,
black box pricing, and higher capital requirements. Moreover,
we remain negative on the P&C reinsurance business, and we
forecast greater third-party participation, increased mobility of
capital, and consolidation among brokers to preclude a
prolonged hard market.

We consider ACGL a premier franchise but are Neutral on the stock given our
cautious long-term outlook for the reinsurance market. ACGL has an industry-
leading reinsurance business with a unique culture and approach to underwriting that
we expect to drive superior returns and less volatile margins over time. Also, Arch is
a top competitor in the mortgage insurance (MI) market, which we think is
structurally better than reinsurance. In primary P&C, ACGL has gained share and
expanded margins, helped by the favorable pricing environment. In the near term,
ACGL's results should benefit from reserve releases in the MI book and healthy
re/insurance margins given hard reinsurance P&C pricing. Higher rates are hurting
MI volumes but should boost investment income. Longer-term, we remain cautious
on the reinsurance market given structural factors such as low barriers to entry and
limited pricing power. Also, ACGL's valuation is not enticing considering its long-
term ROE and growth potential as well as multiples for MI and reinsurance peers.
Mortgage Insurance: Growth to Be Weak, Margins Healthy
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance through acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and
United Guaranty in 2016) during a time when market conditions were favorable,
marked by appreciating home prices, relatively stringent lending standards at
mortgage issuers, and disciplined pricing by mortgage insurers. The company's MI
business has generated healthy margins since, and, despite the temporary setback
from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have been strong overall. We
expect MI results in the near term to benefit from significant reserve releases as loans
delinquent at the onset of the pandemic become current. On the other hand, higher
interest rates will suppress mortgage origination volumes, and, while not imminent, a
recession would increase defaults and thereby pressure margins in the business.
P&C Reinsurance: N-T Encouraging, L-T Cautious
Expected hardening of reinsurance pricing is a positive, but our long-term
outlook for the market remains cautious. Arch has historically produced higher
and less volatile reinsurance margins than most reinsurers, which we attribute to its
focus on specialty reinsurance (where pricing tends to be less competitive),
conservative underwriting philosophy, ability to shift target segments based on
changing market conditions, and judicious management of cat risk. In particular,
ACGL prices business using the risk-free rate (leading to more conservative
underwriting) and uses a long-term compensation plan for underwriters that pays
based on underwriting margins over a multi-year period. Also, the creation of third-
party capital vehicles such as Premia Re has allowed Arch to earn fee income from
its reinsurance franchise. Although we view Arch as a top-tier reinsurer and expect
firmer reinsurance pricing should boost results through 2023, our long-term outlook
for the reinsurance market remains cautious given structural headwinds, including
the commoditized nature of the product, ease of entry of new capital, and a broader
set of capital providers (many, such as pension funds, that have lower return
thresholds). Hence, we are skeptical of a prolonged hard market. Moreover, we
believe that catastrophe risk has been systemically underpriced as prices have not
kept up with the increasing frequency and severity of cat events.

3Q22 Details
This evening, ACGL announced 3Q22 operating EPS of $0.28 compared with our
assumption of $0.71 and consensus of $0.23. Compared with our model, MI results
beat, helped by favorable reserve development, while insurance and reinsurance
missed, primarily due to higher than initially assumed cat losses. Investment income
was significantly better than assumed as well. MI results were marked by sizable
favorable development but weak top-line growth. Insurance earnings were
suppressed by cats, but core margins and premium growth were better than assumed.
Reinsurance premiums were robust as well, but margins were poor (both reported
and core). Investment income was lifted by the rise in interest rates.
ACGL had pre-announced cat losses last week, but we did not adjust our model
following the announcement. This note compares reported results with our initial
assumptions, which we feel better reflects underlying business trends. Comparisons
with the consensus number are not valid as it included a hodgepodge of projections
adjusted and not adjusted for the pre-announcement.

Mortgage Ins .: Earnings Lifted by Reserve Release
We expect growth in the MI business to be weak, but margins should remain
robust in the near term. The MI business reported underwriting income of
$299 million, higher than our $255 million estimate, with upside in margins
(combined ratio of -5.2% versus our 14.5% estimate) more than offsetting lower net
earned premiums (-9.6% vs. - 6.1%E). As in recent quarters, margins benefited from
favorable development on COVID-related reserves (-45.1% vs. - 26.0%E). Margins
were better on a core basis as well (CR ex. cats and PYD 39.9% vs. 40.5%E). Net
written premiums declined 8.2% to $276 million, worse than our expectation.
In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were pressured by artificially high delinquencies
attributable to homeowners availing themselves of government forbearance
programs. However, after spiking initially in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans
has steadily declined, benefiting MI margins. With the expiry of the programs, a
significant portion of previously delinquent loans have cured, particularly loans by
borrowers who were taking advantage of the mortgage payment holiday but were not
in financial stress. Meanwhile, the significant appreciation in house prices has
afforded a cushion to homeowners under stress who are truly struggling to pay their
mortgages, limiting losses for MI carriers. The percent of loans in default in the U.S.
primary MI business was 1.7% at 9/30/22, an improvement from 1.8% at 6/30/22,
2.1% at 3/31/22, 2.4% at 12/31/21, 2.7% at 9/30/2021, and 3.1% at 6/30/2021.

In our view, MI margins will continue to benefit from additional reserve
releases. Under U.S. GAAP accounting, Arch sets reserves for its primary U.S. MI
business based on reported delinquencies (unlike for P&C lines, an IBNR component
is not permitted under U.S. GAAP for primary MI business). An increase in reported
delinquencies at the onset of COVID led Arch and its MI peers to establish
corresponding reserves despite the healthy labor market and appreciation in house
prices. However, a meaningful portion of these delinquencies resulted from
homeowners taking advantage of the government's forbearance protection programs
(mainly to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship. As such, most of these
delinquent loans have cured following the expiration of forbearance programs
(initially set for 12/31/20, but then extended through 9/30/21 and, in some cases,
year-end 2021 or beyond), resulting in the release of previously incurred reserves.
The interplay of cures on previously delinquent loans and how new delinquencies
emerge in response to the economic environment, which is beginning to soften, will
be the key driver of MI margins through 2022 and 2023. Overall, we project MI
margins to remain healthy given strong labor and housing markets, cures on
previously delinquent loans, and the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due
to the appreciation in house prices. On a cautious note, top-line growth in the
business is likely to be sluggish as higher interest rates reduce mortgage originations.
Also, a weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead to higher defaults on
mortgages, particularly among borrowers that have weaker credit profiles, although a
material increase in losses seems unlikely in the near term.
ACGL has become a formidable competitor in the mortgage insurance market
through acquisitions and could expand further via M&A. ACGL entered the
mortgage re/insurance business in 2011 but was only marginally involved in the
market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit unions and as a
reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The company's 2014
acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger foothold
as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P) and

gained distribution in the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch became a top 10
competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market position strengthened
further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which
catapulted the company to a top-3 competitor (as part of the deal, AIG retained 50%
of mortgage insurance blocks originated by UGC prior to 2017). Arch has also
expanded in foreign MI markets through M&A, including its recent acquisition of
Westpac's mortgage insurance business in Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Cats Drove Miss, Core Margins Strong
The insurance business reported elevated cat losses but better than expected
core margins and robust premium growth. The division generated an underwriting
loss of $34 million in 3Q22, worse than expected income of $19 million, driven
primarily by cat losses ($159 million vs. $84 million est.). ACGL had pre-announced
catastrophe losses on October 18, but we did not adjust our model following the
announcement. On a core basis, underwriting results were better, marked by upside
in net written premium growth (+18.6% vs. +17.6%E) and stronger margins (CR ex.
cats and PYD of 89.5% vs. 91.7%E). Both the accident year loss ratio (56.0% vs.
56.2%E) and the expense ratio (33.5% vs, 35.5%E) were more favorable than our
assumption. Similar to the past few quarters, the acquisition expense ratio rose from
the prior year due to a business mix shift to lines such as travel and professional
liability that have higher expense ratios, partly offset by a lower operating expense
ratio given the benefit of high premium growth.

ACGL has attractive opportunities in the primary P&C market, and our
outlook for premium growth and margins is upbeat. After shrinking its "cycle
managed" business (now dubbed as wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to 2017,
ACGL is seeing healthy growth in this part of its primary P&C book, driven by price
increases in the broader market, particularly E&S. This, coupled with consistent

performance in the less opportunistic parts of its book (specialty small/middle market
and franchise), should drive healthy results in the business. On a cautious note, we
believe that the market is past the midpoint of the current pricing cycle and that
exposure growth could decelerate if the economy slows. Hence, although favorable
tailwinds in the insurance business should persist as premiums are earned and certain
lines of business are likely to see harder pricing following Hurricane Ian (e.g.,
property coverage), we expect overall price increases to moderate through 2023.
Reinsurance1: N-T Outlook Positive, L-T Outlook Downbeat
The reinsurance business reported poor margins but strong premium growth.
Underwriting losses in 3Q22 were $197 million, worse than expected income of
$14 million, driven primarily by cat losses ($392 million vs. $166 million est.).
ACGL had pre-announced catastrophe losses on October 18, but we did not adjust
our model for these. Management indicated that its catastrophe loss pick for the
reinsurance business was more top-down driven and assumes industry insured losses
of $50-60 billion. Reinsurance margins were weaker than assumed excluding cats
and PYD as well, with a higher AY loss ratio (58.4% vs. 55.2E%) more than
offsetting a lower expense ratio (27.1% vs. 28.3%E). ACGL attributed the year-on-
year increase in the expense ratio to more quota share business in the quarter, which
has a higher ceding commission than excess of loss, partly offset by a lower
operating expense ratio. On a positive note, net written premium growth was robust,
up 73.6% to $1.1 billion, well above our 57.1% expectation. Management indicated
that unlike some of its reinsurance peers, it is eager to increase its exposure to
property cat given even more favorable pricing conditions following Hurricane Ian.

We remain cautious on the reinsurance market longer term but expect Arch Re
to generate superior results to peers. ACGL's reinsurance business was initially
established to take advantage of the hard market for casualty risk in the early 2000s.

Over the years, however, management has shifted Arch Re's business mix away from
casualty coverage toward other specialty lines such as surety, accident and health,
agriculture, and trade credit, which are generally less competitive and have more
attractive risk-reward. Firm pricing has benefited results in recent years and should
drive continued strong premiums and margins in the near term, especially following
Hurricane Ian. Still, we expect the pace of price hikes to moderate longer term and
remain skeptical of a sustained hard market given the expected entry of additional
capital into the market. Factors that contributed to a multi-year soft market prior to
2018 (glut of capital, greater fluidity/speed of capital, more providers of capacity,
broker consolidation) are still prevalent, and should preclude a prolonged hard
reinsurance market. Separately, we are skeptical of industry catastrophe models as
they have consistently under-estimated the frequency and severity of catastrophe
events, resulting in overall rate inadequacy. On a positive note, ACGL's reinsurance
results could benefit from the release of COVID-related reserves, a significant
proportion of which remain in IBNR.
Raising EPS Estimates
We are raising our 4Q22 EPS estimate from $1.09 to $1.25 and our 2023 forecast
from $4.90 to $5.30. Meanwhile, our 2022 EPS projection is declining from $4.24 to
$3.97 due to downside in 3Q22 results. Our updated model reflects higher than
previously assumed net investment income (in 4Q22 and 2023) and more favorable
prior-year development in the MI business (in 4Q22), partly offset by a higher
beginning share count for future periods due to lower share buybacks in 3Q22. In our
view, catastrophe losses (which would affect reinsurance and insurance margins) and
housing market trends (which affect MI margins and premium growth) are the key
sources of potential variance in reported results and our projections.
Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Arch Capital Group Ltd. (Neutral; Price Target: $57.00)
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premiere franchise, but we remain Neutral on the stock
given our cautious outlook for the insurance market. We believe that ACGL has
an industry-leading reinsurance business that will generate superior and less volatile
underwriting margins over time due to its unique culture and approach to the market.
Also, Arch has established itself as one of the top competitors in the mortgage
insurance (MI) market, which we consider structurally better than P&C reinsurance.
In insurance, ACGL has been able to grow premiums and improve margins, helped
by the firm pricing market. We expect near-term results in the MI business to benefit
from reserve release. Additionally, healthy P&C pricing should boost premium
growth and margins in the insurance and reinsurance segments. Still, our long-term
outlook for the reinsurance business is cautious due to structural issues facing the
market, including low barriers to entry, increased participation by third-party capital,
and limited pricing power. Furthermore, we believe that the stock's valuation is not
too compelling given the company's long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Valuation
We are raising our Dec 2023 price target from $54 to $57 to reflect updates to our
EPS and book value forecasts. Our price target assumes a 1.3x multiple on our
12/31/23E BV ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.4x multiple on our 12/31/23E BV forecast, and
an 11.0x multiple on our 2024 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach with a
sum-of-the-parts analysis that values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from
mortgage insurance. Our target multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix,
which has become more skewed to mortgage insurance. Although mortgage
insurance continues to generate higher returns than re/insurance, especially on legacy
business from 2009 to 2016, we are concerned about greater competition in the
mortgage insurance market. ACGL trades at 1.5x BV and 9.2x 2023E EPS compared
to 1.2x and 7.7x for the reinsurance sector, 0.9x and 6.3x for MI peers, and 1.8x and
12.7x for the broader P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for an extended period. A prolonged hard
market could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent
level. In our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain
insurance combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from
~100% previously, as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
· Management remains proactive with share repurchases. ACGL has
repurchased more stock than expected in recent quarters, partly to take advantage
of its depressed trading multiples. A continuation of the trend could drive upward
revisions in EPS forecasts as well as boost sentiment on the stock.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to
mortgage insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk,
rising unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values
would pressure the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
· Price increases in the reinsurance market slow. Although primary and
reinsurance pricing has been improving since 2018, we do not anticipate
sustained hardening. A reversal in pricing trends could drive downside risk in
EPS estimates as well as dampen sentiment on the sector.
· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development
has been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in
the pace of development could pressure margins and returns.
· Cat losses stay elevated. While prices for cat re/insurance have hardened, the
frequency and severity of catastrophe losses have increased by a larger magnitude
over time. This implies that reinsurance prices need to increase significantly for
underwriters to earn adequate returns, especially in a scenario where cat losses
approximate those in the 2018-2020 period.

period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the
average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's)
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of
the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected
total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it
does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
