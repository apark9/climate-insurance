W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
WRB: Expenses Lead the Way for Berkley; Q3 EPS and Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
Summary. WRB reported Q3 2021 EPS of $1.32 beating both our estimate of $1.06 and
consensus of $0.94. The upside was mainly due to: (1) higher investment income (coming
in at $179.9 million, higher than our $154.3 million estimate) driven by strong results
from its investment funds, (2) a lower tax rate, which came in at 19.6% better than our
21.0% estimate, and (3) a lower expense ratio, which came in at 28.0%, better than our
29.2% estimate and better than 28.7% in Q2. Catastrophe losses came in at $73.8 million,
just below our $75.0 million estimate. There was a minimal, or $1.5 million, of prior period
favorable development in the quarter, just below our estimate for $2 million of favorable
development.
· Estimates go higher. Following WRB's conference call, we are raising our 2021 EPS
estimate to $4.85 from $4.48, while our 2022 and 2023 EPS estimates also rise to
$5.10 and $5.70, from $4.93 and $5.53, respectively, primarily reflecting a lower
expense ratio, which more than offsets a higher underlying loss ratio assumption. We
are maintaining our price target of $92, which is based on 2.1x our 2022 book value
per share estimate. Shares of WRB should trade up tomorrow reflecting the earnings
beat.
· Pricing improved; business continues to go to the E&S market. WRB saw price
increases of 10.1% in the Q3 excluding workers' comp. This does represent a modest
improvement from 9.7% in Q2, but a slowdown when compared to 12.8% in Q1. WRB
said that there was an opportunity to push for more price in the quarter, which led
to the sequential improvement in price increases. Overall, WRB described market
conditions as favorable, and they do not see that trend changing. In particular, they see
this as a good environment for specialty insurers and especially within the E&S market
where they continue to see a good flow of opportunities, which they do not think will
reverse anytime soon.
· Leverage on the expense ratio from top-line growth. The focus on growth is helping
the company show a much better expense ratio. The expense ratio in the quarter
came in at 28.0%, better than our 29.2% estimate and improving from 28.7% in
Q2. While there was around a 30 basis point benefit from Covid-19, that benefit
is dissipating and WRB should continue to have leverage on the expense side as its
earned premium continues to grow.
· Underlying margin improvement driven by the expense ratio. The underlying
combined ratio was 86.9%, better than our 87.2% estimate, and beating us in both
insurance and reinsurance/monoline excess. The underlying loss ratio of 58.8% (versus
our 57.9%) improved by 110 basis points from last Q3 and while it was lower than the
2 points of improvement we were looking for, it was better than the 40 basis points of
improvement in Q2.
· Premium growth remains strong in insurance and reinsurance. WRB saw net
premiums written growth of 23.7%, coming in above our 16.6% estimate, and a
bit below 27.2% in Q2. By segment, insurance net written premium grew by 23.3%
beating our 17.5% estimate and reinsurance growth of 26.7% beat our 10.3%
estimate. Within insurance, WRB saw healthy growth in all lines, with the strongest
growth coming from professional lines (+58.7%), commercial auto (+28.1%) and
other liability (+25.3%). Reinsurance growth was driven by casualty reinsurance and
monoline, while property reinsurance declined.

Q3 2021 In A Nutshell
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q3 2021 EPS of $1.32 beating both our estimate of $1.06 and
consensus of $0.94. The upside was mainly due to: (1) higher investment income (coming in at $179.9
million, higher than our $154.3 million estimate) driven by strong results from its investment funds,
(2) a lower tax rate, which came in at 19.6% better than our 21.0% estimate due to a benefit from
equity-based compensation which vests in August, and (3) a lower expense ratio, which came in at
28.0%, better than our 29.2% estimate and better than 28.7% in Q2. Catastrophe losses came in at
$73.8 million, just below our $75.0 million estimate and included $6 million of Covid-19 losses (we did
not include any Covid-19 losses in our estimate). There was a minimal, or $1.5 million, of prior period
favorable development in the quarter, just below our estimate for $2 million of favorable development.
The underlying combined ratio of 86.9% beat our 87.2% estimate driven by a better expense ratio,
with the underlying loss ratio coming in above us (at 58.8% versus our 57.9% estimate). Repurchases
totaled $92.7 million in the quarter, higher than our $35 million estimate. The operating ROE was
14.9% and the net income ROE was 16.6%. Book value per share increased by 1.5% QoQ and 11.9%
YoY in the Q3.

Highlights of Its Pricing Thoughts
Pricing improved modestly sequentially. WRB saw price increases of 10.1%, excluding workers' comp
(they do not provide the price increase with workers' comp until the 10Q comes out although we
estimate that it was around 9.5% in the Q3). This compares to the 9.7%, excluding workers' comp (8.5%
including comp), in the Q2 and 12.8%, excluding workers' comp (11% including comp), in the Q1. WRB
said that there was an opportunity to push for more price in the quarter, which led to the sequential
improvement in price increases. Overall, WRB described market conditions as favorable, and they do
not see that trend changing. In particular, they see this as a good environment for specialty insurers
and even more for the E&S market, where they continue to see a good flow of opportunities, which
they do not think will reverse anytime soon. Exhibit 2 below shows recent commentary that WRB has
provided on pricing since the start of 2019.
Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period Pricing Comments
Period Pricing Comments
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues
to feel a bit of a growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general
market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a
Q3 2021 good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty writers and even more so the
E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and even more so in
E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's
definitely encouraging.
We saw the firm market accelerate throughout 2019 and it continued to accelerate into 2020, very evident in
Q1. The evidence of this was demonstrated, at least in part by business leaving the standard market, making
its way to the specialty market and in particular, the E&S market. Rate increases were at a level not seen in
some number of years and there was a reduction in capacity that various carriers were offering. All of these
things were being driven by two major factors: (1) low interest rate environment and a knock-on effect for
what that means for investment income; and (2) loss cost trends, driven to a great extent by social inflation,
which had been benign for an extended period of time and then crept up on the industry when it was least
expecting it and it has proven to be much more of an issue.
Q2 2020 S
Q2 2021
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with
the exception of workers; compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view
of loss trend. And that is even as we have been factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important
that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate increase and what does this mean
relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year. The simple fact is
that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that are
available in the business. And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about
possibly how we re-prioritize exposure of growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q1 2020 Rate increases that continue to progress in response to past conversations around social inflation and keeping
up with loss costs.
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the
prior two being the early 2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very
optimistic about its outlook and looks to take advantage of the hardening market environment where some
lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three years, while most lines are approaching
rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the E&S market, driven by:
(1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased
audit premiums; and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are
at or approaching rate adequacy with the exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are
seeing the same increases and gave the example of professional liability having seen rate increases for
quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more recently and workers' comp is in a soft
market.
The challenges that the market faces has stemmed from a low interest rate environment, frequency of cat
activity, and social inflation has gotten to the point where it is no longer solely being talked about but it is
actually being acted upon. This is a meaningful sea change that became very visible in the Q4, and there is no
Q4 2019 sign of that slowing down. WRB said that they were excited about what was in front of us. They were
enthusiastic earlier in 2019, and the Q4 2019 built on that enthusiasm. Further WRB said that while there are
some that would suggest that they tend to be an optimistic organization, and that is a fair statement, the data
that they see in their business and the data the industry data supports this optimistic view.
June 2021
Non-Deal
Roadshow
(6/21/21)
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting
meaningful rate increases. And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in many
product lines where we have been getting rate on rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we think that is
very encouraging for what that means for margin.
The fear factor is on the rise. If a low interest rate environment and consistent global cat activity over the past
Q3 2019 several years wasn't enough, it would seem as though social inflation is finally coming into focus for the
broader audience. People are beginning to realize that it is real and it is here. Frequency of severity can no
longer be ignored, both in the property space, but even more so in the casualty space.
Q1 2021
The market is clearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think that
is very appropriate. And whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and 2002 and
2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is, no cyde looks like any other cycle. When WRB looks at
Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers' compensation, is achieving rate in
excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are seeing meaningful
firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella market, while property
continues to be notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL and but
over the past couple of quarters that seems to be building some momentum.
Q4 2020
We are seeing rate increases across the board with the exception of workers' comp, which certainly is the one
major product line moving in the other direction. Granted, all these other product lines and the rates they're
getting, they're not moving up all in perfect lockstep, but directionally WRB was pleased to see things moving
Q2 2019 in a positive direction. Further WRB saw an increasing number of examples of business getting kicked out of
the standard market and making its way into the specialty/E&S market and in addition to that an increasing
demand for facultative reinsurance. These are all historically signs or classic indicators of a firming market
particularly when you have all of these pieces lining up the way they seem to be.
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are becoming more
acute. As far as workers' compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is more likely than not to
begin to firm as we make our way into 2021 or sometime next year. The loss ratios that WRB selected at
Q3 2020 the beginning of the year assumed that they would not be outpacing loss cost trend by the level that they
arc. The rate increases throughout the year, by and large, are above and beyond what was anticipated.
Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and specifically social inflation, WRB has deliberately decided
to take a wait-and-see attitude.
Ex comp, WRB achieved 6,4% rate increase. WRB achieved this with its renewal retention ratio remaining at a
similar level to what it was over the past several years. From WRB's perspective, with the exception of
Q1 2019 workers' compensation, every major commercial business line is in some point of firming. All product lines do
not march in perfect lockstep with one another, but from WRB's perspective directionally, they are moving
together, with comp being the exception.

Additional Thoughts On The Quarter
See below for an overview of additional thoughts on Q3 2021 earnings versus our estimates.
. Premium growth above us in both insurance and reinsurance/monoline excess. Gross written
premium growth of 23.2% beat our 16.8% estimate (and was only slightly below +24.8% in the
Q2) and net written premium growth of 23.7% also came in above our 16.6% estimate (but was
below +27.2% in Q2). By segment, insurance net written premium growth of 23.3% beat or 17.5%
estimate driven by growth in all lines (with the strongest growth in professional lines, commercial
auto, and other liability), while reinsurance growth of 26.7% exceeded our 10.3% estimate driven
by growth in casualty and monoline excess, while property reinsurance declined. Earned premium
growth of 19.0% was also above our 15.7%. With its growth, WRB said that 40% of it came from
rates that it is taking, and the remainder came from exposure growth (new policies and audit
premiums).
NII beat on stronger alternatives. Net investment income of $179.9 million was ahead of our
$154.3 million estimate due to stronger alternative investment income than our forecast. Core
portfolio income of $103.4 million was above our $92.2 million estimate, while investment funds
of $69.3 million was ahead of our $40.5 million and arbitrage trading accounts of $7.2 million did
fall below our $21.5 million estimate. The investment yield on the core portfolio was 2.00%, slightly
below 2.03% in the Q2 and 2.02% in the Q1.
. Other revenues above us. Revenues from non-insurance businesses was $120.4 million versus our
$95.0 million estimate (although non-insurance expenses also came in above us), insurance service
fees was $21.5 million just below our $23.0 million estimate, and other income of $2.1 million beat
our $0.5 million estimate.
. Combined ratio ahead on lower expense ratio. The combined ratio of 90.4% beat our 90.8%
estimate. The insurance combined ratio was 89.3% ahead of our 90.3% estimate and the
reinsurance combined ratio of 98.4% came in above our 93.9% estimate. The loss ratio was 62.4%
versus our 61.5% estimate, while the expense ratio of 28.0% beat our 29.2% estimate and WRB
alluded to continued leverage on the expense side as earned premium continues to grow (there is
currently still around a 30 basis point benefit from Covid-19, down from the prior 50 basis points
benefit they had been seeing). Catastrophe losses of $73.8 million (3.5 points) were just below
our $75.0 million (3.7 point) estimate, with $6 million of Covid-19 losses. We had not included any
Covid-19 losses in our model, while this did slow from the $25 million of Covid-19 losses booked in
Q2.
· Underlying results beat us on better expense ratio. The underlying combined ratio was 86.9%
versus our 87.2% estimate, due to a stronger than forecasted expense ratio, while the underlying
loss ratio of 58.8% missed our 57.9% estimate, but did improve by 110 basis points from last Q3.
The insurance underlying combined ratio of 87.1% in Q3, was in-line with our estimate driven by
a better expense ratio with the insurance underlying loss ratio coming in at 59.2%, higher than
our 58.1% estimate. The reinsurance underlying combined ratio came in at 85.2%, better than our
87.5% estimate driven by both a better loss and expense ratio. The reinsurance underlying loss
ratio was 56.1%, better than our 56.5% estimate.
· Capital return above us due to higher repurchases. WRB repurchased 1.3 million shares for $92
million, versus our 0.5 million shares for $35 million estimate, and a pick-up relative to the lack of
repurchases in Q2 and $30 million that was repurchased in the Q1. Including dividends (regular and
special), total capital return was $115.8 million, or 46.9% of operating earnings of $246.7 million.
WRB said the pickup in buyback reflects its current view of the capital it is generating, relative to
how much capital it needs, and the attractiveness of its stock.

Summary Of Estimate Changes
Estimates Move Higher. See Exhibit 4 below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q3
2021 earnings. Following WRB's conference call, we are raising our 2021 EPS estimate to $4.85 from
$4.48, while our 2022 and 2023 EPS estimates also rise to $5.10 and $5.70, from $4.93 and $5.53,
respectively, primarily reflecting a lower expense ratio, which more than offsets a higher underlying
loss ratio assumption. Our higher estimates reflect a lower expense ratio, stronger premium growth,
and higher investment income, which more than offsets a higher underlying loss ratio assumption. We
are currently looking for a 28.3% expense ratio in Q4 2021 and 28.7% in 2022 and 2023. Every one
point improvement on the expense ratio, represents around $0.39 per share (7.6% of our 2022 EPS
estimate). In general, we view this as a bullish quarter and call from WRB as they: (1) pointed to the
still good market conditions, including business coming to the E&S market (with an accelerating level
of business flowing to the E&S market, especially in the liability lines), (2) leverage they are seeing on
the expense side, even as Covid-19 savings slow down, and (3) the good conditions which are allowing
their more mature businesses to scale, while also providing opportunities for some of their smaller
operations that now have an opportunity to put "more meat on their bones."

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for WRB: $92.00 from NC
Our price target of $92 is based on a 2.1x multiple of our year-end 2022 book value estimate. Our price target also represents a 18.0x
multiple against our 2022 EPS estimate.
Risk for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe and/or Covid-19 losses.
Investment Thesis
WRB
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases
in 2021 which should translate into underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is currently reflected in consensus
expectations.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities and Structured
Asset Investors, LLC ("SAI"), an investment adviser subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co. If you are paying directly for this research, it is being provided by SAI. For all other
recipients in the U.S. this report is being provided by Wells Fargo Securities.
Wells Fargo Securities' research department may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject
companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject
company's common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on
a subject company's common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the
subject company's common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental
investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary
to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to
maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual
investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in Wells Fargo
Securities research reports.
