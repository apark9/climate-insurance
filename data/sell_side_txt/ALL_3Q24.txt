3Q23 cat losses. Allstate reported $1.18bn pre-tax cat losses for 3Q23 (slightly below our prior
$1.20bn) with ~80% of losses due to two wind and hail events.
Adverse PYD: ALL reported unfavorable PYD of $166mn (ex cat), $84mn of which was from
Allstate Protection, predominantly NatGen, and $82mn from its annual reserve review in Run-off
Property Liability. We had modeled nil for personal auto adverse PYD and $139mn for run-off
claims in the quarter. We update our estimates to reflect the updated cat losses and
unfavorable PYD for 3Q23. Our new 3Q23 EPS estimate is $0.51 from $0.53 prior.
Reinsurance Update & Capital Adequacy: ALL is contemplating purchasing more tail risk, so a
risk return period north of its current bogey of 1/100 on an aggregate basis (multiple events.)
This is not a frequency protection (as the risk return periods for SCS are much lower) though it
does offer stop loss protection for all business lines, not just catastrophes. We think ALL is
approaching reinsurance to better protect its balance sheet, particularly restoration of its
contingent capital layer in its internal model; it should serve as a lesser protector of earnings.
Likely a 1/1 inception date. We have heard mixed investor sentiment on this deal. For the bulls,
this structure may lead to capital relief and in turn a path to return capital to shareholders in the
future. For the bears, the structure is nothing to get excited about. We lean more on the
cautious side, we would prefer to see a reinsurance structure that is more economic with a
higher probability of triggering. At the same time, we do not think ALL is facing a dire "capital
issue" as its regulatory based capital, while lower than peers, is far from the point of inviting
regulatory intervention. In a counter-intuitive way, lower rating agency capital requirements
have provided capital relief and more efficiency, see: Allstate Corp .: UPDATE: Rating Agency
Downgrades: More than Capital 14 Aug 2023. ALL has already recalibrated lower capital
requirements on what it chooses to hold, as told by Jess Merten at our FS conference.

Auto rate increases: Allstate brand total auto rate increase efforts are a tad underwhelming,
adding +0.9% to its total book during Sept., yet that marks a moderate improvement
from +0.2% in Aug. We think ALL's cumulative auto rate increases (see Figure 3) are not
near inflecting with loss trend (Figure 2.)
Auto oss trends read-throughs: Based on our fireside chat with Jess Merten, CFO, at the
Barclays FS conference last month, ALL is not seeing stabilization of auto loss trends.

call that physical damage loss trend is moderating. We note, TRV was silent on bodily injury loss
trend. PGR's Sept results showed improvement, yet their monthly results are too bouncy by
month for us to point to a definitive trend. We are modeling less auto underlying loss ratio
sequential improvement (20bps q/q) for ALL (unchanged) than PGR's actual (150bps q/
q for total) and TRV's actual (260bps q/q for auto) improvements.
Valuation: Our Equal Weight rating and $108 price target (unchanged) is based on a 50/50
weighted average of 10.5x (unchanged) our 2024 EPS estimate of $9.83 (unchanged) and 1.78x
(unchanged) our YE24 book value per share ex AOCI estimates of $63.29 (from $63.31).

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
ALL's fundamentals are strong and
we look forward to seeing progress
on its transformative growth plan.
However, pricing correction actions
may stall ALL's progress in
actualizing stronger PIF growth.
Upside case
USD 130.00
Loss cost trends abate, returning to
2019 baseline levels. Successful
execution of Allstate's
transformational growth plans via
efficiency gains that is translated to
strong PIF growth, particularly in
auto. Our upside case of $130
assumes ~2.1x our '24 BVPS ex AOCI
estimate.
Downside case
USD 100.00
Steeper acceleration of loss cost
trends, particularly on the severity
side. Prolonged period of achieving
approvals from regulators with
respect to requested rate increases.
Our downside case of $100 assumes
~10x our '24 EPS estimates.

Pricing Journey
ALL recognized 4.5% rate increases in auto in September across 9 locations, incrementally
adding 0.9% to its total book during the month. While monthly pricing increases peaked in Sept.
'22 (+16.2%), we recognize ALL's cumulative 26.2% pricing increases achieved since Jan. '22.
Moreover, it takes 18 months for ALL to earn in pricing increases, prolonging needed
improvements per its underlying loss ratios within personal auto.

Despite ALL's traction raising rates, we do not think the company's pricing has inflected with
loss trend. Our basis is comparing ALL's pricing index to CPI auto measures, based to 2019. For
instance, ALL's pricing index of 128.8 (as of Sept. '23, with 2019 as the base year) compares to
CPI used car prices of 134 on the same basis (which would represent auto physical damage
piece of the loss ratio).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within
the next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or

Valuation Methodology: Our $108 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended 10.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.78x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.

evaluate a company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain ESG credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of ESG considerations, models and methodologies means it can be challenging to definitively
and universally classify a company or investment under an ESG label and there may be areas where such companies and investments could improve or
where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable finance related regulations and the development of
jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the interpretation of such terms in the market.
We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. Any references to 'sustainable', 'sustainability', 'green',
'social', 'ESG', 'ESG considerations', 'ESG factors', 'ESG issues' or other similar or related terms in this document are as used in our public disclosures
and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition or other interpretation of these terms unless specified otherwise.
