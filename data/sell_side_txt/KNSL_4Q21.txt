Kinsale
4Q21: Strong Results Across the Board, Positive
Operating Momentum Likely to Persist
KNSL had another strong quarter marked by healthy premium growth and
robust underwriting margins. We view Kinsale as a high quality E&S
franchise that we expect to perform well through the underwriting cycle, and
we think there is likely to be upward momentum in its financial results over
the medium term as it gradually unwinds the embedded economics in its book
from the current hard market. Still, we remain Neutral on the stock given its
valuation as well as the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle
continues to moderate (albeit more gradually than we had initially expected).
. EPS upside. KNSL reported 4Q21 operating EPS of $1.76, well above our
$1.39 estimate and consensus of $1.36, driven primarily by a lower loss
ratio (53.1% vs. 59.3%E). The expense ratio (21.4% vs. 21.5%E) and net
written premium growth (+36.2% vs. +34.4%E) were modestly better.
Within the loss ratio, both attritional losses (57.1% vs. 61.0%E) and
catastrophe claims (-0.1% vs. +2.3%E) were responsible for the favorable
variance. Prior year reserve releases were in-line. KNSL's results have
exceeded our expectations for four consecutive quarters and we believe
there is likely to be upside in our earnings estimates from a lower loss ratio
assumption. However, we look to the earnings call to get more insight into
any one-off factors (such as unusually low property losses) that could have
benefited the accident year loss ratio in 4Q21. Given KNSL's casualty-
focused mix, though, our view is that the 4Q21 result is probably more a
reflection of management's loss picks (which in turn are informed by their
view of pricing/terms and conditions vs. loss trends) and is therefore more
likely than not to be trendable.
· Premium growth modestly better, margins were strong. Net written
premiums grew +36.2% y/y to $177.5 mil., slightly above our $175.1 mil.
estimate (+34.4%), driven by continued healthy submission activity and
higher prices. The CR of 74.5% was well below our 80.8% estimate, and
results were also strong on an accident year basis (78.6% vs. 82.5%E). Net
investment income was close to expectations.
· Given margin momentum, we think investor interest will likely shift to
growth. We think KNSL's growth outlook in 2022 and beyond will be more
of a focus tomorrow on the earnings call given the clear margin momentum
in its results. Related to this, we also expect KNSL's capital requirements
vis-à-vis growth to be a discussion point. In the past, KNSL had signaled that
it would fund its near-term capital requirements using debt. With a 20%
debt-to-capital ratio as a constraint, we believe that Kinsale can issue
upwards of $150 million in debt. The company's net written premium to
leverage ratio at year-end 2021 was roughly 1x equity.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small
commercial accounts. Our long-term outlook for KNSL is
upbeat given its large addressable market, superior technology
platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable
competitive advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full
and we are concerned about the risk of multiple compression
as the P&C pricing cycle continues to turn.

Investment Thesis
Please see Page 5 for tables
summarizing 4Q21 results.
KNSL will hold its earnings
conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern
on February 18, 2022.
The dial-in number for the call is
844-239-5282, code: 2881553.
The call replay will be available on
https://ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We maintain our Neutral rating. In our opinion, KNSL is well-positioned to
benefit from the hard P&C market on both volumes and margins. Also, we think that
its low cost operating model is a sustainable competitive advantage in the E&S
market across the pricing cycle, especially against higher cost competitors such as
Lloyd's writers. On the other hand, the stock's valuation seems full versus
commercial peers and specialist names, even after accounting for KNSL's growth
potential and above-average margins. Furthermore, while favorable P&C market
conditions have persisted longer than we had initially anticipated and will have
positive implications for embedded margins, we think that the eventual turn in P&C
pricing presents downside risk to KNSL's above-average multiple.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
We expect the E&S market, where KNSL operates exclusively, to see continued
strong new business flows and healthy price hikes in the near to medium term despite
a handful of major underwriters increasing their focus on growth. We believe this
favorable operating backdrop will give KNSL ample opportunities to continue
driving strong premium growth. Similarly, the combination of price hikes and
conservative reserving should allow KNSL to report healthy (and likely improving
margins) for the foreseeable future. Looking beyond the current hard market, we see
KNSL sustaining growth by continuing to build out its product offering, expanding
distribution, and gaining incremental market share from other insurers that have less
pricing flexibility to compete because of their much higher expense ratios.
Low Expenses a Durable Competitive Advantage
Kinsale operates with a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform that it
built from the ground up, in contrast to many of its peers that use unwieldy hybrid
systems consisting of legacy platforms and newer technologies. The net result has
been an operating model that has the capacity to take on significant business volumes
without sacrificing customer responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense
efficiency. We think that this operating leverage gives Kinsale the ability to
outperform higher cost competitors (especially Lloyd's platforms, which constitute
more than 20% of the E&S market) through the pricing cycle. During softer markets,
KNSL has the ability to grow premiums as others pull back while maintaining above-
average profitability. In hard markets, Kinsale can operate comfortably as a price
taker and generate an even larger excess return relative to other companies.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect price hikes to
continue moderating modestly through 2022 and 2023 as re/insurers re-position
themselves for growth and clients push back on rate-on-rate price hikes. This seems
to be reflected in multiples for commercial P&C names, which are essentially flat
versus pre-COVID levels, but less so for specialist names like KNSL, which are
trading at a premium compared to historical levels. In our view, this presents the risk
of multiple compression as pricing/volume swings tend to be more volatile in E&S
given its function as a safety valve for the industry. Although we believe that KNSL
will thrive even if prices soften, our view is that a reasonable valuation analysis will
necessarily have to look several years out because of KNSL's above-average growth
profile (our reference year is 2024), and would therefore have to account for how
conditions in the P&C market are likely to be at that future time.

platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable competitive advantage.
Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current levels and we are concerned about
the risk of multiple compression as the P&C pricing cycle continues to moderate.
Valuation
We are maintaining our December 2022 price target at $225. Our December
2022 target assumes a 4.5x P/BV target multiple on 2024 book value, which we
believe is justified given KNSL's above-average growth over the long-term (+20%
growth versus mid- to high-single-digit growth for most large commercial peers) and
margin profile (80-85% combined ratio versus 85-90% for peers). KNSL trades at
6.3x book value, well above the specialty peer average (ex. PLMR) of 1.8x and
commercial peers at 1.6x.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher
prices and greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If
current conditions persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our
forecasts and investor sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We
would expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds
growth expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned
pricing exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving
suggests margin improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin
improvement tracks higher than expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are
beginning to push back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are
deploying capital and positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to
turn, we believe there is a risk of multiple compression for insurers that have seen
an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation re-emerge in casualty reserves.
Although unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and
low limits, the re-opening of the economy and the court system could drive a
surge in pent-up liability claims.

· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has
a strong underwriting track record and it is entering new lines of business in a
very strong part of the cycle. Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage,
the impact of badly underwritten risks is likely to persist.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire
period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the
average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's)
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of
the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected
total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it
does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
