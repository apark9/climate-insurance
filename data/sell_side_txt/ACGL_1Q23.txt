Arch Capital
Firing on All Cylinders
ACGL reported robust results, marked by upside in EPS and strong business
trends. We view Arch as a premier franchise and believe that it is one of the best
positioned carriers to benefit from the hard reinsurance market. However, we are
Neutral on the stock due to valuation.
· EPS upside; rasing forecasts. Operating EPS of $1.73 was well above our
$1.51 estimate and consensus of $1.45. The upside was driven by higher than
assumed underwriting margins in all three divisions. Investment income was
slightly better than expected as well, while catastrophe losses and prior-year
reserve development were roughly in-line. We are raising our 2Q23 EPS
estimate from $1.43 to $1.53 and our 2024 projection from $5.71 to $6.11.
· Business trends were better than assumed. Reinsurance results were
especially robust, marked by strong premium growth (net written premium
growth of 52% versus our 19% estimate) and better than assumed margins (CR
84.3% versus our 84.5% estimate; CR ex. cats and PYD 83.3% vs. 85.5%).
Similarly, insurance margins were strong (CR 90.9% vs. 92.8%E; CR ex. cats
and PYD 89.8% vs. 91.1%). Insurance net written premiums increased 19%,
higher than our 17% assumption, helped by healthy growth in all major product
lines with the exception of professional lines. MI earnings benefited from
upside in margins (CR 20.0% vs. 25.0%E), which were lifted by the release of
COVID-related reserves. Weaker than assumed MI written premiums was one
of the only major negatives. As expected, ACGL did not repurchase stock in
1Q23. Management commentary on business trends was very upbeat.
. We expect ACGL's near-term results to be healthy, but our long-term
outlook is mixed. Our model projects ACGL's results in the next few quarters
to be marked by healthy margins and top-line growth in the re/insurance
business and robust margins but weak premium growth in the MI division.
Although MI margins should remain healthy, we forecast them to moderate
from recent levels as the tailwind from reserve releases wanes. A weaker
housing market and higher unemployment present key risks for MI results.
Meanwhile, our long-term outlook for the P&C reinsurance business is
cautious. ACGL is one of the best positioned insurers to benefit from the hard
market, but we remain skeptical of sustained hard pricing and anticipate
additional capacity entering the market over the next 1-2 years. Arch also has
flexibility to supplement organic growth with repurchases, but buybacks are
likely to be modest in the near term, partly due to ACGL's valuation multiple.
F.Morgan
· We maintain our Neutral rating. In our opinion, ACGL is a top-tier insurance
franchise, but in relatively commoditized markets. We believe that ACGL is
among the best positioned carriers to take advantage of hard reinsurance
pricing. On a cautious note, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance market
remains negative. Moreover, we feel that ACGL's valuation is not too enticing
given the company's long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Arch is a premier re/insurance franchise that has an
established track record of generating higher and less volatile
underwriting margins than most peers. Still, we are Neutral
given our cautious long-term outlook for the P&C reinsurance
market and the stock's valuation. In our view, near-term
results in the MI business will be healthy, but margins should
moderate as reserve releases slow. Meanwhile, in the P&C
reinsurance business, hard pricing and tighter terms/
conditions should boost underwriting results in 2023.
However, our long-term outlook for Arch's business is less
upbeat. We expect MI returns to be held back by the
commoditized nature of the product, black box pricing, and
higher capital requirements. Additionally, we are negative on
the P&C reinsurance business longer term and expect the
entry of additional capacity to weigh on pricing over time.

We consider ACGL a premier franchise that is well-positioned to benefit from hard
reinsurance pricing, but are Neutral on the stock given its valuation. In our view,
ACGL has an industry-leading reinsurance business with a unique culture and approach
to underwriting that will generate above-average and less volatile margins over time.
Additionally, Arch is a top competitor in the mortgage insurance (MI) market, which we
view as a structurally better business than reinsurance. In primary P&C, ACGL has
gained share and expanded margins, helped by the favorable pricing environment. Near
term, we expect ACGL's results to be marked by strong margins and top-line growth in
re/insurance, and moderating margins but poor premium growth in mortgage insurance.
However, despite favorable dynamics in the reinsurance market currently, our long-term
outlook remains cautious. We expect structural headwinds such as low barriers to entry
and the commodity nature of the product to preclude sustained hard pricing. Lastly,
ACGL's valuation is not enticing given the stock's recent outperformance.
P&C Reinsurance: N-T Outlook Positive, L-T Cautious
Near-term results in ACGL's reinsurance business should benefit from hard
pricing and tighter terms/conditions, but our long-term outlook for the market
remains cautious. Arch has historically generated better and less volatile margins than
most reinsurers, which we attribute to its focus on specialty reinsurance (where pricing
tends to be less competitive), conservative underwriting philosophy, ability to shift
target segments based on changing market conditions, and judicious management of cat
risk. In particular, ACGL prices business using the risk-free rate (leading to more
conservative underwriting), and uses a long-term compensation plan for underwriters
that pays based on underwriting margins over a multi-year period. In addition, the
creation of 3rd party capital vehicles such as Premia Re has allowed Arch to earn fee
income from its reinsurance franchise. We consider Arch a top-tier reinsurer and expect
firm pricing to boost results through 2023. Still, our long-term outlook for the
reinsurance market remains cautious given various structural issues, including its
commoditized nature, the ease of entry of new capital, and a broad set of capital
providers (some of which, such as pension funds, have lower return thresholds). We are
skeptical of prolonged hard pricing and believe that any signs of additional capacity
entering the market would hurt sentiment on reinsurance stocks, which have become
consensus longs since late 2022.
Mortgage Insurance: Growth to be Poor, Margins to Moderate
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance through acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and United
Guaranty in 2016) when market conditions were favorable, marked by appreciating
home prices, stringent lending standards at mortgage issuers, and disciplined pricing by
mortgage insurers. Arch's MI business has generated healthy margins since then and,
despite the temporary setback from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have
been strong. In our opinion, near-term MI margins will remain healthy, although the
benefit of COVID-related reserve releases should taper through 2023. Meanwhile,
higher interest rates are likely to suppress mortgage origination volumes, and although
not imminent, a recession would increase defaults and pressure margins.

1Q23 Details
This evening, ACGL reported operating EPS of $1.73, considerably above our $1.51
estimate and consensus of $1.45. The upside was driven by higher than assumed
underwriting margins in all three divisions, with reinsurance results especially robust.
Investment income was slightly better than expected as well, while catastrophe losses
and prior-year reserve development were roughly in-line.

Business trends were strong. Reinsurance results were especially robust, marked by
strong premium growth (net written premium growth of 52% versus our 19% estimate)
and better than assumed margins (CR 84.3% versus our 84.5% estimate; CR ex. cats and
PYD 83.3% vs. 85.5%). Similarly, insurance division margins were strong (CR 90.9%
vs. 92.8%E; CR ex. cats and PYD 89.8% vs. 91.1%). Insurance net written premiums
increased 19% from 1Q22, higher than our 17% assumption, helped by healthy growth
in all major product lines with the exception of professional lines. MI earnings benefited
from upside in margins (CR 20.0% vs. 25.0%E), which were boosted by the release of
COVID-related reserves. Weaker than assumed MI written premiums was one of the
only notable negatives in results. As expected, ACGL did not repurchase stock in the
first quarter. Management commentary on the operating environment in all three
divisions was very upbeat.

Mortgage Ins .: Earnings Benefited From Reserve Release
We expect mortgage insurance (MI) results to be marked by slow new business
growth and strong persistency, and healthy (but lower) margins. Higher interest
rates are a headwind for growth, while moderating reserve releases on COVID-related
delinquencies should drive a decline in margins as the year progresses. The MI business
reported underwriting income of $243 million, higher than our $216 million estimate,
driven by upside in margins (CR 20.0% vs. 25.0%E) and net earned premiums (+2.2%
from 1Q22 vs. - 2.8%E). As in recent quarters, the earnings beat was mainly driven by
the release of COVID-related reserves (-24.6% vs. - 20.0%E ; $73 million vs. $56
million in dollar terms), although core margins were better than anticipated as well (CR
ex. cats and PYD 44.5% vs. 45.0%E). The attritional loss ratio was slightly worse
(25.3% vs. 25.0%E) but was more than offset by a lower expense ratio (19.3% vs.
20.0%E). On a negative note, net written premiums decreased for the sixth straight
quarter, down 9.4% to $261 million, worse than our $274 million estimate. Management
attributed the drop to higher ceded premiums and lower gross written premiums due to
the combined impact of lower originations in Australia as well as a decline in US MI
single premium business.
In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were hurt by artificially high delinquencies caused
by homeowners availing of government forbearance programs. However, after initially
spiking in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has steadily declined. In particular,
with the expiry of the forbearance programs, a significant portion of previously
delinquent loans has cured, particularly loans by borrowers who were taking advantage
of the mortgage payment holiday but were not in financial stress. Meanwhile, the
significant appreciation in house prices has provided a cushion to homeowners under
stress who are truly struggling to pay their mortgages, limiting losses for MI carriers.
The percent of loans in default in the U.S. primary MI business was 1.7% at 3/31/23,
down from 1.8% at 12/31/22 and 2.1% at 3/31/22.

In our view, MI margins will benefit from reserve releases, but the tailwind should
abate relative to recent levels. Higher reported delinquencies at the onset of COVID
caused Arch and its MI peers to establish corresponding reserves despite the healthy

labor market and appreciation in house prices. A meaningful portion of these
delinquencies arose from homeowners taking advantage of the government's
forbearance protection programs (mainly to preserve liquidity), not actual financial
hardship. However, under U.S. GAAP accounting, Arch still had to establish reserves
based on reported delinquencies despite the high likelihood that the delinquencies would
eventually cure (unlike other P&C lines an IBNR component is not permitted under
U.S. GAAP for primary MI business). With most of these delinquent loans curing
following the expiration of forbearance programs (initially set for 12/31/20, but then
extended through 9/30/21 and, in some cases, year-end 2021 or beyond), ACGL has
been releasing previously incurred reserves. The interplay of cures on previously
delinquent loans and how new delinquencies emerge given the economic environment,
which is beginning to soften, will be the key driver of MI margins through 2023.
Overall, despite an expected decline, we forecast MI margins to remain healthy given
strong labor and housing markets, cures on previously delinquent loans, and the equity
cushion accumulated by homeowners due to the appreciation in house prices. On a
cautious note, top-line growth is likely to be weak as higher interest rates reduce
mortgage originations. Also, a weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead to
higher defaults on mortgages, albeit a material increase in losses seems unlikely in the
near term. Barring a recession, we expect core margins to stay healthy, but a declining
tailwind from reserve releases should suppress reported results even if economic trends
stay favorable.
ACGL has become a leading competitor in the mortgage insurance market through
acquisitions and could expand further via M&A. ACGL entered the mortgage re/
insurance business in 2011 but was only marginally involved in the market at the onset,
competing as a primary insurer through credit unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE
credit risk transfer program. The company's 2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage
Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger foothold as it received a ratings upgrade
for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P) and gained distribution in the bank
channel. Following the deal, Arch became a top 10 competitor in the domestic private
MI market. Arch's market position strengthened further following its 2017 acquisition
of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which catapulted it to a top-3 spot (as part of the
deal AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance blocks originated by UGC pre 2017).
Arch has also expanded in foreign MI markets through M&A, including its acquisition
of Westpac's MI business in Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Lower Claims Drove Earnings Upside
The insurance business reported better than expected underwriting margins and
premium growth. Underwriting income in 1Q23 was $114 million, above our $93
million estimate, driven by a favorable combined ratio (CR 90.9% vs. 92.8%E). The
expense ratio was higher than assumed (35.0% vs. 34.1%E), but was more than offset
by better attritional loss experience (54.8% vs. 57.0%E) as well as lower catastrophe
losses and higher reserve releases. Net premiums written increased +19.1% from 1Q22,
higher than our +16.7% assumption, which ACGL attributed to new business, higher
prices, and an increase in reinsurance retentions. All major product lines in the
insurance division experienced premium growth with the exception of professional
lines, where management noted soft pricing.

Source: Company reports and J.P. Morgan estimates.
We believe that ACGL has attractive opportunities in the primary P&C market,
and we expect premium growth and margins to remain healthy. After shrinking its
"cycle managed" business (now dubbed as wholesale/large capacity) from 2012 to 2017,
ACGL is seeing healthy growth in this part of its primary book, driven by price
increases in the broader market, particularly E&S. Results in less opportunistic parts of
ACGL's book (specialty small/middle market and franchise) have been strong as well.
On a cautious note, we believe that the market is past the midpoint of the current hard
pricing cycle, and that exposure growth could decelerate if the economy slows. As such,
although tailwinds in the insurance business should persist as premiums are earned and
certain lines of business see harder pricing (e.g. property coverage), we expect overall
price increases to moderate through 2023.
Reinsurance: Robust Results, Near-Term Outlook Upbeat
ACGL's reinsurance business reported strong premium growth and better than
expected margins. Underwriting income in 1Q23 was $213 million, higher than our
$195 million estimate, driven by strong premium growth (net earned premium growth of
+65.3% vs. +56.0%E) and slightly better margins (CR of 84.3% vs. 84.5%E). Core
margins were strong (CR ex. cats and PYD 83.3% vs. 85.5%), helped by favorable
claims and expenses, while higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable development
were partial offsets. Net written premium growth was very strong, up 51.5% to $1.7
billion, well above our +18.6% forecast. Similar to the insurance segment, management
attributed premium growth to new business, higher prices, and an increase in retentions/
less retrocession. Management was upbeat on ACGL's position in the market amid
constricted capacity from competitors. Furthermore, Arch noted that primary insurers
have been retaining more risk.

We are skeptical of a sustained hard reinsurance market, but ACGL is better
positioned than most peers to take advantage of favorable market conditions in the
near term. ACGL's reinsurance business was initially established to take advantage of
the hard market for casualty risk in the early 2000s. Over the years, however,
management has shifted Arch Re's business mix away from casualty coverage towards
other specialty lines such as surety, accident and health, agriculture, and trade credit,
which are generally less competitive and have more attractive risk-reward. Firm pricing
has benefited results in recent years and should drive continued strong premiums and
margins in the near term, especially following Hurricane Ian. Still, we expect the pace of
price hikes to moderate longer term and remain skeptical of a sustained hard reinsurance
market given the expected entry of additional capacity. Factors that contributed to a
multi-year soft market prior to 2018 (glut of capital, greater fluidity/speed of capital,
more providers of capacity, broker consolidation) are still prevalent, and should
preclude a prolonged hard reinsurance market. On a positive note, ACGL's reinsurance
results could benefit from the release of COVID-related reserves, a significant
proportion of which remain in IBNR. Similarly, we believe that loss reserves which
were set up for Ian could ultimately prove to be too conservative (most primary
companies booked lower Ian-related losses than reinsurers).

Raising EPS Estimates
We are raising 2Q23 EPS from $1.43 to $1.53, 2023 EPS from $5.30 to $5.82, and
2024 EPS from $5.71 to $6.11. We do not expect MI reserve releases to recur at the
1Q23 level in future periods, but are increasing our assumptions for overall investment
income as well as margins and premium growth in the reinsurance and insurance
divisions. In our opinion, cat losses (which would affect reinsurance and insurance
margins) and housing market trends (which affect MI margins and premium growth) are
the key sources of potential variance in reported results and our projections.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $67.00)
Investment Thesis
We consider Arch a premier re/insurance franchise, but are Neutral on the stock due
to valuation. In our opinion, ACGL has an industry-leading reinsurance business that will
generate superior and less volatile underwriting margins over time due to its unique culture
and approach to the market. Also, Arch is a top competitor in the mortgage insurance (MI)
market, which we consider structurally better than P&C reinsurance. In insurance, ACGL
has grown premiums and improved margins, helped by the firm pricing market. In the near
term, we expect MI results to remain healthy even as margins continue to normalize and
reserve releases taper off. Additionally, hard pricing should boost premium growth and
margins in the re/insurance segment. On the other hand, our long-term outlook for the
reinsurance business remains cautious and we are skeptical of sustained hard pricing given
structural issues such as low barriers to entry, increased participation by third-party capital,
and limited pricing power. Lastly, the stock's valuation is not too compelling considering
ACGL's long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2023 price target from $62 to $67 to reflect the increase
in our EPS and book value estimates. Our price target assumes a 1.4x multiple on our
12/31/23E BV ex. AOCI forecast, a 1.5x multiple on our 12/31/23E BV forecast, and an
11.0x multiple on our 2024 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach with a sum-of-
the-parts analysis that values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from mortgage
insurance. Our target multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix, which has
become more skewed to mortgage insurance. ACGL trades at 2.1x BV and 12.5x 2023E EPS
compared to 1.7x and 9.8x for the reinsurance sector, 0.9x and 7.1x for MI peers, and 1.8x
and 14.4x for the broader P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for an extended period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. In
our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, even as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
· Management remains proactive with share repurchases. ACGL repurchased more
stock than expected in 2H21 and 1H22, partly to take advantage of its depressed trading
multiples. A continuation of the trend could drive upward revisions in EPS forecasts as
well as boost sentiment on the stock.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.

· ACGL and/or peers raise capital to take advantage of the hard reinsurance
market. This, in turn, could result in a reversal in pricing trends and potentially drive
reduction in EPS estimates as well as hurt sentiment on the sector.
· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development has
been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in the pace
of development could pressure margins and returns.
· Cat losses stay elevated. While prices for cat re/insurance have hardened, the frequency
and severity of losses have increased by a larger magnitude over time. This implies that
reinsurance prices need to rise significantly for carriers to earn adequate returns,
especially if cat losses are close to those in recent years.

stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable,
the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)

market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying
analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
