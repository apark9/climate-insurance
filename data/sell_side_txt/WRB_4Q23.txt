WRB: Much of the Pig Is Through the Python; Q4 and Conference Call Roundup
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
WRB reported Q4 EPS of $1.45, above our $1.32 and consensus of $1.38 higher
investment income, lower cats, and better underlying results. Both gross and net
premium written growth picked up to 11% and 12%, respectively.
Estimate and price target changes: We are raising our 2024 est. to $6.10 (from $6.05)
reflecting higher NII and better premium growth while our 2025 est. is unchanged at
$6.80. We are introducing an initial 2026 EPS estimate of $7.50. Our price target is now
$92 (from $84) based on 13.5x our 2025 EPS estimate (previously it was based on 2024).
The stock: Shares should trade up on the earnings beat and improved top-line growth in
the quarter as well as the improvement in the underlying loss ratio.
Takes for the group: WRB had a positive view on pricing and the market in general (away
from some pockets of professional liability). They also pointed to growth remaining in the
double-digits in 2024, and seemed positive about potentially seeing some opportunities
to extend their duration in their fixed book (from the current 2.4 years). As reinsurers
focus on some liability lines (particularly in umbrella and auto liability), this should lead to
further discipline in the casualty market.
The good: The underlying loss ratio was 58.8% beating our 59.4% and improving 50 bps
from last year due to mix, lower attritional property losses, and absence of fire losses this
year. From a growth perspective, the 12% net written premium growth is the strongest
quarterly growth since Q2 2022 and WRB alluded to growth being in-line with (or better
than) this level in 2024. WRB was positive about the overall market environment, with
price increases of 8% ex workers' comp, exceeding loss trend.
The bad: Investment funds added $11M in Q4, down from $23M last year due to market
value adjustments in the real-estate area, but up from $4.5M In Q3 and better than our
$4M estimate. WRB saw $1 million of favorable development (which was better than our
estimate for modest adverse) and pointed to similar trends to the other quarters of the
year - which implies they most likely released on more recent accident years, which offset
some reserve additions for the softer market years (2015-2019).
The ugly: Not much was "ugly" in the quarter with good growth, margins, and low cats.
Other conference call highlights: WRB does not provide much in the way of guidance.
They have said that the expense ratio should be comfortably below 30% in 2024 even
when accounting for investments in technology, data & analytics, and new start-up
operating unit expenses. See inside for highlights of key issues for WRB.

Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe
that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of
rate increases in 2024, particularly as they lean in on property
insurance and reinsurance, which should translate into a good level
of premium growth, which we do not believe is currently reflected in
consensus expectations.

Base Case | $92.00
. Our price target of $92 is based on just
around a 2.3x multiple of our year-end
2025 book value estimate
· Our price target also represents a
~13.5x multiple against our 2025 EPS
estimate.
· The 13.5x is a slight discount to where
WRB has historically traded as we look
to be conservative given social inflation.
Upside Scenario | $121.00
· In the upside scenario we use a multiple
of 3x 2025 book value, close to peak
valuation levels.
· We assume WRB is able to see
consistent double-digit premium
growth, margin expansion and good
investment returns resulting in industry
leading returns.
.
Assumes lack of significant adverse
development in its reserves.
Downside Scenario | $61.00
· In the downside scenario we use
a multiple of 9x 2025 EPS (which
translates into 1.5x book value) and is
below trough levels (although those
multiples were in lower interest rate
environments).
. In this scenario WRB could see lower
premium growth, margin compression
and volatility within its investment
returns.
· Also the downside scenario could
include volatility within its reserves and
potential adverse development on the
softer market years (2015-2019).
Upcoming Catalysts
· WRB's 10-K which comes out after earnings and will give
additional color on its reserve development for the quarter
· Monthly pricing surveys, which will highlight the overall
strength (or lack thereof) of the commercial lines pricing
environment

Q4 Highlights
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q4 EPS of $1.45, beating our $1.32 and consensus of $1.38. The upside
was due to higher investment income (investment income came in at $313.3 million, higher than our
$276.0 million estimate), lower cats, and better underlying results. Catastrophe losses came in at $32
million (1.2 pts), lower than our $50 million (1.9 pts). Prior year favorable reserve development was
$1 million, relative to estimate for $3 million of adverse development (0.1 pts). WRB does not call out
the level of prior year development by segment until the 10-K, but on its call they did say that there
was nothing notable to call out in either segment. Investment income came in at $313.3 million, better
than our $276 million estimate, with the core portfolio, arbitrage trading account and investment
funds all coming in above us. There were FX losses of $33.6 million that offset earnings by $0.10 per
share.
The underlying combined ratio of 87.2% a bit below our 87.6% estimate; the underlying loss ratio
came in 60bps better than us with the 50 bps of Y/Y improvement due to business mix and lower
attritional property losses. The expense ratio was 28.4%, 30 basis points higher than us. WRB bought
back $106.7 million of shares in the quarter, relative to our $100 million estimate. The average diluted
share count of 271.0 million was less than our 271.2 million estimate. The operating ROE was 21.9%,
and the net income ROE was 23.6%. Book value per share grew by 8.4% sequentially to $29.06.

What the Companies Are Saying - WRB
WRB's call focused on pricing,
margins, prior year reserve
development, capital return and
investments
WRB does not provide much
in the way of guidance. They
have said that the expense ratio
should be comfortably below
30% in 2024
Outlook
WRB only provides guidance around its expense ratio (which is expected to be below 30%). They did
point to premium growth continuing from here and our sense is that net written premium growth in
2024 should be in-line with (or exceed) the 12% they saw in the Q4.
Pricing
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8% in Q4, a touch below 8.5% in Q3, due to business mix.
Overall, they view this 8% as exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss trend. Within property
cat reinsurance, WRB viewed the market at 1/1/24 as very attractive, but maybe not as attractive as
at 1/1/23. Further, they highlighted that there is a distinction between property cat and property per
risk reinsurance. They also said there is a distinction with the primary property market, where they are
pushing hard on rate, and it is sticking.
Within professional lines, D&O rates have been in a free fall and WRB is not chasing this business as
they do not view rates at adequate levels. Some other professional lines including medical professional,
hospital professional liability, and architects and engineering do not make sense to them from a rate
adequacy perspective. They do see some opposite moves on the non-standard side. They did say that
as reinsurers focus on some liability lines (particularly in umbrella and auto liability), this should lead to
further discipline in the casualty market.
Guidance
WRB does not provide much in the way of guidance. They have said that the expense ratio should be
comfortably below 30% in 2024 even when accounting for investments in technology, data & analytics,
and new start-up operating unit expenses.
Investments
The duration of its portfolio is 2.4 years and WRB would look to take this up when they see a window
of opportunity, and they said they could potentially see the duration go to 2.5-2.7 years. They are
putting new money to work at rates of 5%+, with the core book yield around 4.7% in the quarter. The
fixed income investment income in the quarter did get a little bit of an uptick from some securities in
Argentina that are inflation-adjusted, but it sounds like the majority is run-ratable. Further, with where
interest rates are currently, they view traditional fixed income attractive and alternative investments
as less attractive. Investment funds added $11M in Q4, down from $23M last year due to market
value adjustments in the real-estate area, but up from $4.5M In Q3. Generally, the investment funds
are reported on a one quarter lag.
Liquidity and Capital
WRB's debt to capital ratio ended Q4 at 27.6%, which is below the YE 2022 level of 29.6%, and flat
vs. 29.1% at the end of Q3 2023. Repurchases in the quarter totaled $107 million, just above our
$100 million estimate and higher than $2.9 million in Q3. There was also $128.8 million of dividends,
including $106.7 million from special dividends. The company's payout ratio was 67.3%, relative to
44% in Q3 and over 100% in Q1 and Q2. Even with the capital return in 2023, WRB sees themselves as
having more than adequate capital to support the ongoing growth in the business.

Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period
Pricing Comments
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8% in Q4, a touch below 8.5% in Q3, due to business mix. Overall they view this 8%
as exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss trend. Within property cat reinsurance, WRB viewed the market at 1/1/24
as very attractive, but maybe not as attractive as at 1/1/23. Further, they highlighted that there is a distinction between property

highlighted that there is a distinction between property cat and property per risk reinsurance. They also said there is a distinction
with the primary property market, where they are pushing hard on rate, and it is sticking. They spoke positively about business
continuing to go to the E&S market.
Q4 2023
Q3 2023
WRB is very focused on social inflation and they said that you can see that in their rate increases (8.5% excluding workers'
compensation) and they intend to stay on top of it. The market has been accepting of its rate increases as shown in its steady
renewal retention of 80%. Specifically WRB is pushing very hard on rate within commercial auto and the market is accepting of it -
this led to strong growth in commercial auto in the quarter.
Q2 2023
WRB saw rate of 8.2% (ex workers' comp), which was relatively stable with the Q1 (at 8.3%) and reflective of its business mix.
WRB said that there continues to be a bifurcation in the standard market and E&S market. Within the standard market, where
National carriers do not have an appetite to write business that is leading to opportunities on the E&S side. WRB said that
submission flow remains robust, and they are encouraged about activity over the balance of the year, and flagged good results in
July. Overall WRB's view is that the industry is struggling with the balance between rate needs and keeping up with loss trend
versus their desire to grow.
Q1 2023
Regarding property, the company noted that its disappointment in Q4 pricing discipline has improved month over month, resulting
in what is regards as real progressing being made on the pricing front in April. The company feels the rationalization of pricing in
the property market, while more pronounced on the cat side, is broad-based overall. The company called out public D&O, certain
professional liability lines, and commercial auto as being the most irrational parts of the market. Still, WRB does see pockets of
opportunities even within professional liability, especially if written on an E&S basis.
WRB said they were disappointed in the discipline in property pricing in the Q4 as they said many carriers failed to take into
account limited reinsurance capacity and higher reinsurance costs. They believe that property pricing should continue to improve
as 2023 develops. For workers' comp, they said they missed the timing on when the market would begin to harden and they
expect pricing to be bumpy in 2023 with expectation for considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given severity trends,
particularly medical inflation. For auto, they said there is rate to be had but remains the most susceptible line to social inflation
and requires thought and judgement in underwriting for loss costs. Umbrella and general liability excess are amongst the brighter
opportunities with one area on the cautious watchlist being large account excess lines. Professional liability is a tale of two stores
with D&O being pressured given the rising competitive landscape but other lines within professional liability should provide good
opportunities. WRB said they participated at 1/1 renewals and said the clock is right to lean in with good discipline with the US
offering more attractive returns than international.
Q4 2022
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers'
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Q3 2022
Period
Pricing Comments
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to see
resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth target,
which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust. In
workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity and
erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from that.
Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable momentum, up
45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing is
currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.
Q1 2022
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured
in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious and most of
the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive on WC pricing
in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this stage, particularly
in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any current opportunities.
Q4 2021
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which continues to feel a bit of a growing
headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just general market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we
don't see that trend changing. More specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty
writers and even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and even more so
in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse anytime soon. So that's definitely
encouraging
Q3 2021
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers;
compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been
factoring in a bit more for financial inflation. It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate
increase and what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year. The simple
fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look at the margins that are available in the
business. And as we become pleased with the available margins we start to think about possibly how we re-prioritize exposure of
growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q2 2021
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with the prior two being the early
2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to take
advantage of the hardening market environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three years,
while most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in the E&S market,
driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2) expectations for increased audit premiums;
and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB indicated that most all lines are at or approaching rate adequacy with the
exception of workers' comp. Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the example of professional
liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more recently and workers' comp
is in a soft market.

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB trades at 2.67x Q4 2023 book value, which is above the 5-year and 10-
year average multiples of 2.19x and 1.83x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 1.42x and 10-year
minimum is 1.11x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 2.99x, which is well above where the shares are
currently trading. We do note that for the P&C sector price-to-book valuations are fuller given the
unrealized losses we have seen in this rising interest rate environment. For WRB, if we exclude AOCI,
the shares are trading at just around 2.38x adjusted Q4 book. On a P/E basis, WRB is trading at 9.2x
consensus 2025 EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year average multiples
of 16.9x and 16.8x, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year max is 25.0x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases in
2024, particularly as they lean in on property insurance and reinsurance, which should translate into a good level of premium growth, which
we do not believe is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $92.00 from $84.00
. Our price target of $92 is based on just around a 2.3x multiple of our year-end 2025 book value estimate
· Our price target also represents a ~13.5x multiple against our 2025 EPS estimate.
· The 13.5x is a slight discount to where WRB has historically traded as we look to be conservative given social inflation.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe losses.

This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
