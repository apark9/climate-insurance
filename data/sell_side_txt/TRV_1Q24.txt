TRV: Reserves Rain on Shares; Conference Call Roundup
Our Call
TRV traded down on the day owing to the adverse development in liability for more
recent accident years and the slowdown in releases in workers' comp. Even with estimates
going up (on personal lines), we think reserves will be a near-term overhang.
The stock from here: We recognize shares traded down over 7% (S&P down 0.6%) on less
than $100m liability strengthening. But we do think the concern over slowing reserve
releases in comp and strengthening within liability will weigh on the shares (even with
numbers going up on personal lines), as we do not expect most companies to review their
long-tail lines in Q1. TRV also has seen more adverse development than peers on more
recent years (based on YE reserve data - see TRV: Reserves in Focus).
Estimate and price target changes: Our 2024 EPS estimate goes to $19.52 (from
$19.45), 2025 EPS goes to $21.10 (from $20.85), and 2026 EPS estimate goes to
$22.85 (from $22.55). Our estimates reflect better underlying margins, particularly in PI,
higher earned premium and higher investment income, more than offsetting higher cats
and lower favorable PYD (we model to no development in BI except for quarters when
they do their asbestos review). Our price target is unchanged at $211.
Read thrus: (1) Workers' comp reserve releases were offset by adverse development on
liability lines (on more recent years) and runoff, and any movement in long-tail lines will
draw intense focus. We expect WRB could also see movement within their LT reserves
(for more see our report); (2) Personal auto margins are improving as rate increases are
earned in and severity is getting better; and (3) Commercial rate and exposure continues
to moderate modestly but remains at healthy levels.
Personal auto margins turn profitable: The company printed a CR of 94.6% (AY CR of
94.9%), which was the first profitable quarter since Q1 2022. The RPC in Q1 was 16.6%
(vs 16.8% in Q4), which should continue to help margins as we move through the year.
The quarter benefited less than a point from favorable frequency, but was still strong
improvement. The Q1 is about 3 pts lower than the FY CR, although it does not take into
account the impact of rate increases being earned in.
Guided items: TRV upped their fixed income NII guidance to $640m in Q2, $665m in Q3,
and $690m in Q4 (vs $630-$675m previous guide), to which we potentially see some
more upside given the 10-year is up ~30bps since the end of Q1. TRV reiterated their
expense ratio guide of 28-28.5%, despite some headwinds from Corvus (within BSI) as
they have to earn in the premium of the $200m book, which should take a few quarters.

Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the good pricing
environment within commercial lines and improving margins within
personal auto. With that being said we think there are questions on
their reserves following the increases for liability lines in Q1 and as
a result we think the shares could underperform the broader group
until they show a lack of movement on the reserve side. We rate the

What the Companies Are Saying-TRV
Outlook
The company noted that the reserve movements in the quarter, particularly the additions to reserves
for their liability lines were pretty small and were to account for uncertainty given the long-tail nature
of these lines. They did not want to provide color on which accident years specifically were driving the
change (outside of it was limited to the more recent AYs), but they did say they also put a little more
IBNR in the current accident year. When asked about the slowing E&S pricing data, the company noted
they have a diverse $2.5b portfolio, and they didn't see any material slowdown in the segments they
compete in. The underlying personal auto combined ratio improved 8.5 pts Y/Y in auto due to the
benefit of earned pricing and the quarter benefited less than a point from favorable frequency related
to the mild winter. The quarter is also typically three points lower than the overall combined ratio for
the year but that does not take into account higher earned effective pricing, which should benefit
margins as their 12-month policies earn in the higher rates the company has taken.
Highlights of TRV's call included
commentary around reserve
movements, pricing (in BI and
PI), and its underlying margins in
auto.
Guidance was given around:
(1) fixed income investment
income, (2) expense ratio, and
(3) personal lines RPC.
Pricing
Within Business Insurance, umbrella, property and auto led the way with RRC in or very close to
double-digits. Property was in the double-digits but was down a couple of points sequentially, which
they viewed an appropriate move. In workers' comp, RRC was about a 0.5 point more than negative
than Q4 2023 although with continued healthy exposure, RPC in comp continues to be positive in the
low single-digits. In domestic auto, the RPC of 16.6% was consistent with expectations and given the
improving profitability, they expect RPC to moderate through the balance of the year. New business
volumes grew in states where they have achieved written rate adequacy. In home, RPC was 13.4%, and
they pointed to largely closing the gap in insurance to value, which led to the big sequential decline
from the Q4. They expect home RPC to remain at these levels throughout 2024 as they continue to
take rate in response to elevated loss costs. The decline in new business and PIF in home is part of their
ongoing effort to thoughtfully deploy capacity and manage rate adequacy.
Guidance
Guidance provided by TRV includes:
· Fixed income/short-term investment guide raised: TRV updated its guidance for fixed income
and short-term investment income for 2024. TRV is now looking for fixed income and short-term
investment income to be $640m in Q2, $665m in Q3 and $690m in Q4 vs the previous range of
$630m - $675m per quarter for 2024.
· Expense ratio guidance reiterated: The overall expense ratio should be in the range of 28-28.5%
for FY 2024. They did say that the Corvus acquisition should weigh on the expense ratio (within
Bond & Specialty) as they have to earn in the premium of the acquired $200m book.
· Personal lines RPC guide: Within personal auto, the RPC should decelerate from here as most
states are at written price adequacy although they will continue to seek rates on a state-by-state
basis. Within home, the RPC should remain around these levels for the balance of the year
Investments
Travelers updated its outlook for after-tax investment income from fixed income and short-term
investments to range from $640 million in Q2 2024, $665m in Q3 and $690m in Q4. The company
reiterated that the change in unrealized investment gains and loss does not impact how they manage
their investment portfolio and has little or no impact on their cash flows, statutory surplus or
regulatory capital requirements.
Liquidity and Capital
TRV has $1.6 billion of capital at the holding company (up from $1.5 billion at the end of 2023)
with all of their capital ratios at or better than target levels. TRV has $5.8B left under its repurchase
authorization as of 3/31.

Renewal Premium Growth
Personal Lines: Auto RPC should remain strong
but begin to move down from here as more of the
book reaches rate adequacy on a written basis.
Homeowners' RPC (19.4% in Q3) should remain
consistent through the end of the year, and then it
should moderate into the low double-digits.
Personal Lines: Auto RPC should remain in the
mid-teens through H1, while homeowners' RPC
should moderate to the low double-digits in 2024
as their automatic increase in limit factors will
return to more normal levels
Personal Lines: Auto RPC (16.6% in the Q1)
should slow from here given improved
profitability, while Homeowners' RPC (13.4% in
the Q1) should remain consistent through the
balance of the year.
Fixed Book: Expect 2024 quarterly fixed income
investment income to range between $630-690

Highlights of Our Estimate Changes
Overview of our estimate changes. The exhibit below highlights the changes we made to our earnings
model following Q1 2024 earnings.
. 2024 EPS goes up to $19.52 (from $19.45) to reflect better underlying margins, particularly in
personal lines, higher earned premiums, and higher investment income, mostly offset by a higher
cat load and less favorable reserve development.
. 2025 EPS goes up to $21.10 (from $20.85) to reflect better underlying margins, particularly in
personal lines, higher earned premiums, and higher investment income, partially offset by a higher
cat load and net adverse reserve development.
. 2026 EPS goes up to $22.85 (from $22.55) to reflect better underlying margins, particularly in
personal lines, higher earned premiums, and higher investment income, partially offset by a higher
cat load and net adverse reserve development.

Business Insurance Rating Environment-RRC Down; Exposure Slows
· In Q1, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +7.0%, a deceleration from the +7.3% in
the prior quarter. They did note RRC in their national property book was strong and in the double-
digits, but down a couple points sequentially. Umbrella, property and auto all had RRC in or very
close to double-digits. Exposure growth was up 3.6%, down from the 4.3% in Q4, but remaining at
strong levels. The 10.6% of RPC in Q1 was down from the 11.6% we saw in the prior quarter. The
exhibits below show the trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal rate
change since 2020.

The Travelers Companies, Inc.
Pricing Highlights-Personal Lines
Personal Lines-TRV Sees Rate Slow in both Auto and Home as profitability improves
· Within Personal Auto, TRV saw renewal premium change decelerate sequentially to 16.6% from
16.8% in the previous quarter and their auto underlying combined ratio dropped below 100%
(94.9% in the quarter) for the first time since Q1 2022. The underlying margin was down 7.8%
sequentially and down 8.5% Y/Y, but the company noted it did benefit a little under a point from
favorable frequency. They expect personal auto RPC to decelerate from here but do not expect a
sharp downtick given most of their policies are 12 months. They did point that they have reached
written price adequacy in all but a few states.
. Homeowners' RPC also decelerated sequentially to 13.4% from the record-high 20.9% in Q4. The
highlighted the sequential deceleration was mainly driven by less increases on coverage limits on
the dwelling (as they saw dramatic increases in property coverage limits in 2022 and 2023 and
have now caught up). The underlying combined ratio was 5.1 pts better Y/Y. They expect RPC to
remain near these levels for the balance of the year.
. Auto and home PIFs down sequentially. Travelers' new business in auto was flat Y/Y at $278
million, after seeing a 7% increase Y/Y last quarter. Auto PIFs were down 40bps sequentially (vs
the flat change last quarter). Home new business was down 21% in the quarter (a deceleration
from a decline of 25% in Q4). From a PIF standpoint, home was down 90bps, which was a similar
sequential change as last quarter.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the good pricing environment within commercial lines and improving margins within
personal auto. With that being said we think there are questions on their reserves following the increases for liability lines in Q1 and as
a result we think the shares could underperform the broader group until they show a lack of movement on the reserve side. We rate the
shares Equal Weight
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $211.00 from NC
. Our price target of $211 is based on just over 10x our 2025 EPS estimate.
· Implies around a ~1.6x multiple of our projected 2025 book value estimate of ~$133.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and reported / underlying margins coming in better
than expected.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
