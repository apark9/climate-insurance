TRV: A Consistent Message from Travelers; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 4/20 to discuss Q1 results. The call focused
on the impact from the pandemic, pricing, capital and its view surrounding potential M&A.
Our 2021 EPS estimate rises to $10.10 (from $9.80), our 2022 estimate is unchanged
(at $11.95) while 2023 goes to $12.95 (from $12.80) reflecting better Bond & Specialty
margins. Our price target rises to $155 (from $150) and is based on 1.25x our 2022E
book value and we continue to have an Equal Weight rating on the shares. TRV modestly
outperformed owing to the earnings beat. The company's message surrounding pricing
and margins was consistent with last quarter.
. TRV is the first P&C insurer leaving many tea leaves for the rest of earnings
season - including: (1) pricing was stable with the strong Q4 levels with the company
expecting its margins to improve during 2021 (as rates continue to exceed loss trend),
(2) it was a strong investment income quarter driven by alternative investments, (3)
within their personal auto book they are starting to see driving return toward pre-
pandemic levels, and (4) M&A commentary was high level and did not necessarily
remove them from a potential HIG transaction (although we continue to think it is less
likely). See inside our note for more details on the laterals from TRV's quarter.
· Consistent pricing and margin color. TRV expects pricing to remain in excess of loss
trend which could lead a bit more than the just under 200 basis points they saw in the
quarter, although it sounds like they are close to the peak of the underlying margin
improvement they might see. TRV did not want to prognosticate on where pricing
levels might go from here except to say that they think they will continue to see
earned rate in excess of loss trend. Away from workers' comp., TRV said that pricing in
every other product lines were near or above recent record highs.
· Workers' comp thoughts. TRV continues to see workers' comp rates that are
negative, but close to bottoming. Further, they did say that workers' comp results have
been a little better than expected during the Covid-19 downturn, which could also
have an impact on pricing from here.
. Buyback and M&A thoughts are top of mind for investors. TRV added $5 billion to
its authorization reflective of the fact that they only had $800 million left under their
prior authorization. They were asked several questions on M&A and said there was no
change to their M&A approach, and they continue to evaluate transactions through
a three prong approach - a transaction would have to (1) improve their long-term
return profile, (2) reduce volatility and/or (3) create shareholder value through some
other strategic benefit.
· CVA reserve thoughts. TRV took a charge related to the Child Victims Act in Q1
2019 and continues to be comfortable with their loss reserves. They did not want to
comment on whether they would consider settling with the Boy Scouts, similar to
what HIG announced last week.
. Net investment income guidance unchanged. Investment income guidance for fixed
income portfolio was unchanged for the balance of 2021. While new money yields are
now around 90-100 basis points off of the expiring portfolio yield (down from a gap of
150 basis points last quarter) that did not have a material impact given the duration of
the portfolio combined with the $10 million range in the investment income guidance.

Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 4/20 to discuss Q1 results. The call focused on the impact
from the ongoing pandemic, pricing, capital and its view surrounding potential M&A. Our 2021 EPS
estimate rises to $10.10 (from $9.80), our 2022 estimate is unchanged (at $11.95) while 2023 goes
to $12.95 (from $12.80) reflecting better Bond & Specialty margins. Our price target rises to $155
(from $150) and is based on 1.25x our 2022E book value.
The Quarter In A Nutshell. This morning (4/20), TRV reported Q1 core EPS of $2.73, beating both
our $2.44 estimate and the $2.37 consensus estimate. TRV's results beat on higher favorable reserve
development and stronger investment income, which more than offset higher catastrophe losses. The
underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in-line with our estimate with Bond & Specialty beating us,
Personal Lines just below us, and Business Insurance about in-line with us. NPW rose by 2.2%, versus
our 2.8% estimate. NII was $701 million, better than our $660 million estimate with the upside all due
to other investments. Cats were $835 million, higher than our $615 million estimate. TRV repurchased
$397 million shares, ahead of our $375 million estimate. Book value per share fell by 2.8% and the core
ROE was 11.1%.

2021 Outlook
2021 outlook unchanged. Exhibit 2 below highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2021.
TRV did not provide specific 2021 guidance, which is consistent with previous quarters in 2020 after
TRV pulled its outlook in Q1 2020 for renewal premium change and its underlying margins as a result
of the uncertainty associated with the potential impacts associated with Covid-19. TRV did provide
an outlook for net investment income, and also provided helpful color around other line items in the
model. TRV still expects 2021 fixed income NII to be in the $420-430 million range per quarter on
an after-tax basis during the remaining three quarters of 2021. TRV did not call out any alternative
investment income trends. For catastrophe losses, TRV highlighted that as of the Q1 it has incurred
$915 million towards the $1.9 billion retention under its aggregate program. TRV did not point to a
specific level of share repurchases and they pointed to adding to their authorization (by $5 billion) as
the program was down to $800 million after the Q1 repurchases (which is typically around the level
when they add to their buyback program). In Business Insurance, TRV did not call out the direct level
of Covid-19 losses in the quarter (and pointed to the frequency benefit as more than offsetting the
losses) and pointed to being able to continue to expand margins this year as rate remains in excess of
loss trend. Rate exceeded loss trend by a little less than 2 points in the quarter (picking up from over
1.5 points in Q4). Bond and Specialty did not have a specific guidance for the year (last quarter TRV
said they expected the underlying margin to be better than the 87% in H2 2020 during 2021) but
they did call out continuing to see a Covid-19 impact. Personal lines results benefited from favorable
frequency but TRV pointed to starting to see miles driven move back to pre-pandemic levels. In
homeowners' results were impacted by elevated fire losses. On the expense ratio, TRV highlighted
that the quarter was impacted by volume-related costs (ie, commissions).

Pricing momentum in commercial lines. Business Insurance renewal rate change was +8.4%, just
below +8.5% in Q4, but up when compared to +8.2% in Q3, +7.3% in Q2, and 5.9% last Q1. We had
expected slight improvement in the quarter. Exposure growth was +0.8%, versus the -0.5% last
quarter. TRV also noted that it achieved rates that were near or above record highs in all lines away
from workers' compensation.

Takeaways For The Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us and the laterals for the rest of the group are below.
Net-net, the biggest take is the stable pricing environment and the expectation that they continue to
expect to see underlying margin improvement throughout 2021.
Commercial lines pricing remains firm in Q1 with renewal rates up 8.4% in business insurance, just below
8.5% in Q4 and higher than the 8.2% in Q3. TRV said that it continues to see rates that are at or near
record highs in all lines but workers' comp. This continued rate firming is positive for the commercial
insurers (AIG, CB, HIG, and WRB) and specifically AIG and CB where workers' comp represent a
smaller portion of their book, in our view.
1. Underlying margin in Business Insurance benefited from rate exceeding trend. TRV said that earned
rate exceeded loss trend by a little less than 2.0 points in Business Insurance, which is better than
the above 1.5 points they pointed to in the Q4. TRV also said that it expects the favorable rate
environment to persist and result in expanding margins in Business Insurance. To us, this points
to strong underlying margins for the group in the Q1, with the potential for greater improvement
in 2021 as higher rates are earned in. This would be a positive as well for the commercial lines
insurers, including AIG, CB, HIG and WRB.
2. Covid-19 losses were not specifically called out. There were some pushes and pulls within the
segments - it sounded like Covid-19 was a wash in Business Insurance (with losses offset by
frequency benefits), a negative to Bond & Specialty and a benefit to personal auto (although this
should wane as driving picks up). This ties to our overall thought that Covid-19 related losses
should slow for P&C insurers in the Q1 relative to other quarters of 2020.
3. Personal auto continues to see favorable benefits from the ongoing pandemic, but that should subside.
TRV's Personal Auto book saw continued benefits to its margin from lower claims frequency as
a result of fewer miles driven. The Personal Auto segment's underlying margin came in at 86.6%,
which was better than the 87.4% in Q4, and better than last Q1 (at 90.9% although last Q1 only
benefited from the low driving due to the pandemic for part of March). TRV did point to driving
returning toward pre-pandemic levels as restrictions have eased and economic activity is picking up.
In general, we remain cautious on the personal auto insurers (ALL and PGR) due to the lack of
pricing in the market, combined with the potential for frequency to return to more normalized
levels as driving picks up (something which TRV alluded to on its conference call).
4. Net investment income guide is unchanged. TRV once again maintained its 2021 quarterly fixed
income related NII guidance and still expects to report between $420-430 million per quarter on
an after-tax basis, which to us shows that the decline in interest rates is largely captured within
numbers right now.
5. Strong alternative investment quarter. Alternative related investment income totaled $218 million
in Q1, up from $182 million in Q4 2020 and $173 million in Q3 2020. We think alternative related
investment income could surprise to the upside, for both P&C and life insurers, based on TRV's
strong results.
6. Repurchases picked up in the Q1. TRV repurchased $397 million shares in Q1, picking up from $201
million shares in Q4 after not repurchasing any in both Q3 or Q2. We expect all insurers, P&C
and life, to pick up their level of buyback activity in the Q1, especially given the still attractive
valuations across both the P&C and life insurance sectors.

Business Insurance Rating Environment -TRV Rates Were Stable, While Exposure Inflected
Positively
. In the Q1, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +8.4%, just below +8.5% (revised higher)
in Q4, but up when compared to +8.2% (revised higher) in Q3, +7.3% (revised lower) in Q2, and
5.9% (revised lower) last Q1. Exposure growth was +0.8% versus -0.5% in the Q4 2020 (revised
up from -1.1%), -0.4% in Q3 2020 (revised up from -1.1%) and better than the -1.3% in Q2 2020
(revised up from -1.9%) and the -0.8% in Q1 (revised down from -0.4%). See Exhibits 4 and 5 below,
which shows the recent trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal rate
change.
· TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC (last summer) as the company was unsure
of how the economy would be impacted from Covid-19. The company has yet to bring back RPC
forward guidance but has pointed to margin improvement as Business Insurance earned rate
remains in excess of loss trend. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains positive
in the Q2.

and they are monitoring trends and incorporating them into their state-specific pricing decisions.
Homeowners' pricing decelerated modestly but still remained in the high-single digits at 7.7%
versus 8.2% in the Q4, 8.1% in the Q3, 7.6% in Q2, and 7.4% in Q1 of 2020.

Margins Benefited From Favorable PYD
Underlying Results In-Line With Us
· The consolidated combined ratio was 96.6%, beating our 97.6% estimate largely reflective of a
higher level of favorable reserve releases which more than offset higher cat losses. Cats of $835
million (of which $703 million were related to the Texas winter storms) were above our $615
million estimate, while favorable reserve development of $317 million were significantly above
our $16 million estimate due to higher releases in Business Insurance and Personal Lines. The
underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in-line with our estimate, and improved 1.9 points from
last year. Underlying results beat us in Bond & Specialty, while Personal Lines was just below us, and
Business Insurance was about in-line with us.
. Catastrophe losses totaled $835 million with $703 million related to the Texas winter storm. TRV
noted that the $835 million in cat losses was a record level for the first quarter. Through the end
of the Q1 TRV has $915 million of cat losses counting towards its aggregate retention (due to
TRV's cat defintion some losses count towards the aggregate retention that the company does not
consider cat).
. Reserve releases were $317 million, significantly better than our $16 million estimate due to
higher releases in Business Insurance and Personal Lines. Business Insurance which saw favorable
development of $134 million (significantly better than our $2.5 million and the highest quarterly
level for the segment in three years) as releases in workers' comp were only partially offset by
strengthening for environmental reserves and Personal Lines saw $168 million (higher than our
$13 million) which included $62 million subrogation benefit from the Woolsey fire. There was also
$10 million of subrogation from the Woolsey fire within Business Insurance.

Investment Income And Other
Investment Income Beats Us; 2021 Guidance Unchanged
. Net investment income was $701 million pre-tax, better than our $660 million estimate. Travelers'
after-tax book yield on its investment portfolio was 2.9%, modestly above the 2.8% yield for Q4
2020. Fixed income investments added $491 million pre-tax, lower than our $494 million estimate,
while alts were $218 million, higher than our $172 million estimate and benefited from higher
private equity returns. Short-term investments added $3 million, below our $4 million estimate.
TRV continues to expect its fixed income investment income to total $420-430 million after-tax
for each quarter of 2021 as it is forecasting the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets
to be more than offset by a lower average yield given the lower interest rate environment. TRV also
noted that new money yields are coming on at 90-100bps (versus 150bps last quarter) although it
did not have an impact on Q1 results given the duration of the portfolio.
Capital Management - Announces New Repurchase Authorization
. TRV repurchased $397 million for 2.7 shares in the Q1, better than our estimate for $375 million
of share repurchases. Of the $397 million repurchased, around $41 million (or 0.3 million shares)
were related to shares retained to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of
restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares used by TRV employees to
cover the price of certain stock options that were exercised. Dividends were $204 million, bringing
total capital return to $625 million, compared to the $755 million of core earnings. Total capital
return to shareholders was 82.8% of core earnings in Q1 2021 and we are currently forecasting
94.1% and 81.9% in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
· In conjunction with earnings, TRV added $5 billion to its buyback program. The program had
$805 million remaining on it after the Q1 repurchases. TRV said that the announcement of this
authorization did not have any impact on its M&A strategy, but instead was authorized given the
low level of remaining authorization under its existing plan.
. In terms of M&A, TRV said its approach to M&A has not changed and would be open to
transactions that would reduce volatility, or add new product lines/geographies/scale. The
company did say that it can still continue to be successful without pursuing M&A.
Premium Growth Just Below Us
. Net premiums written rose 2.2%, just below our 2.8% estimate and the +2.7% in the Q4 2020.
Results were ahead of us Bond & Specialty, but missed us in Business Insurance and Personal Lines.
Gross premiums written growth of 3.1% was ahead of our 2.0% estimate, but was slightly lower
than 3.2% last quarter.
. Business insurance net premiums written were down 1.6% versus our down 0.5% estimate and
down 1.9% in the Q4. Bond & Specialty new premiums written were +9.0% versus our +4.7%
estimate and the +12.0% last quarter. Personal Insurance net premiums written were +6.6% versus
our +7.8% estimate and +7.6% last quarter. Within Personal Insurance, auto net premiums written
of +2.3% missed our +6.2% estimate and were modestly above +1.8% last quarter, while home
net premiums written growth of +12.4 was ahead of our 10.0% estimate but was modestly lower
relative to 12.6% last quarter.
CVA Reserves
. TRV noted that they took a charge related to the Child Victims Act (CVA) in Q1 2019 and is
comfortable with their loss reserves at the moment. TRV did not want to comment on whether
they would consider settling with the Boy Scouts, similar to what HIG announced last week.

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for TRV: $155.00 from $150.00
Our price target of $155 is based on around a ~1.25x multiple of our projected 2022 book value estimate of around $123 and 13.0x our
2022 EPS estimate of $11.95.
Risk for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.
Investment Thesis
TRV
We believe that TRV will benefit from one of the hardest commercial pricing environment since 2003. Although we are positive on the
commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers due to its smaller account exposure and higher workers'
comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation, lower
reserve releases, and Covid-19, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral
and rate its shares as Equal Weight as a result.
