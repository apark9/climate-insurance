WRB: Conservatively Tackling This Market; Q4 EPS and Conference Call Round-Up
Our Call
Summary. WRB reported Q4 2021 EPS of $1.53 beating both our estimate of $1.28
and consensus of $1.25. The upside was mainly due to: (1) higher investment income
(coming in at $165 million, higher than our $132 million estimate) driven by strong results
from its investment funds, (2) a lower tax rate, which came in at 17.0% better than our
21.0% estimate, and (3) a better underlying margin as the expense ratio beat us, and the
underlying loss ratio was just about in-line with us. Catastrophe losses came in at $42.4
million, above our $29.0 million estimate. There was a minimal $1.3 million of prior period
favorable development in the quarter, just below our estimate for $2 million of favorable
development.
· Estimates go higher. Following WRB's conference call, we are raising our 2022 EPS
estimate to $5.40 from $5.10 while our 2023 EPS estimate goes to $6.10 from
$5.70, primarily reflecting stronger premium growth and a modestly better expense
ratio (to go to the mid-point of its 28-29% guide). We are introducing a 2024 EPS
estimate of $6.75. We are raising our price target to $98 from $92, which is based
on 2.0x our 2023 book value per share estimate. Shares of WRB should trade up
tomorrow reflecting the earnings beat.
. Healthy pricing but slowing. WRB saw price increases of 9.3% in the Q4 excluding
workers' comp. This does represent a modest decline from 10.1% in Q3, 9.7% in Q2,
and 12.8% in Q1. WRB remains confident in their ability to lean into markets where
pricing is adequate and above trend. Overall, WRB described market conditions as
favorable, and they do not see that trend changing. In particular, they see this as
a good environment for specialty insurers and especially within the E&S market.
Management noted that they continue to see good opportunities and that admitted
carriers entering the space are not having any discernible impact at this point.
· Leverage on the expense side. WRB continues to see ongoing improvement in its
expense ratio. The expense ratio in the quarter came in at 27.8%, better than our
28.3% estimate and improving from 28.0% in Q3. While there was around a 30 basis
point benefit from Covid-19, that benefit is dissipating and WRB should continue to
have leverage on the expense side as its earned premium continues to grow, especially
given leverage in newer businesses. The company guided to an expense ratio of
28-29% in 2022.
· Underlying margin improvement driven by the expense ratio. The underlying
combined ratio was 86.0%, better than our 86.4% estimate, as outperformance in
the insurance segment outweighed an uptick in reinsurance/monoline excess. The
underlying loss ratio of 58.2% (versus our 58.1%) improved by 100 basis points from
last Q4, in-line with the Q3. WRB agreed that the company was being conservative
with its loss picks (given concerns around social inflation) which is probably costing
it around 1 point of additional margin improvement. We view this positively as it
provides a cushion and the potential for favorable reserve development down the
road.
· Strong premium growth. WRB saw net premiums written growth of 26.6%, coming
in above our 17.9% estimate, and above the 23.7% in Q3. By segment, insurance net
written premium grew by 25.8% beating our 18.8% estimate and reinsurance growth
of 33.0% beat our 11.0% estimate. Within insurance, WRB saw healthy growth in all
lines, with the strongest growth coming from professional lines (+49.2%), commercial

Q4 2021 In A Nutshell
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q4 2021 EPS of $1.53 beating both our estimate of $1.28 and
consensus of $1.25. The upside was mainly due to: (1) higher investment income (coming in at $165.0
million, higher than our $131.8 million estimate) driven by strong results from its investment funds,
(2) a lower tax rate, which came in at 17.0% better than our 21.0% estimate due to a benefit from
lower foreign tax rates and tax-preferred investments, and (3) a lower expense ratio, which came in
at 27.8%, better than our 28.3% estimate and better than 28.0% in Q3. Catastrophe losses came in
at $48.5 million, above our $29.0 million estimate and included $12 million of Covid-19 losses (we
did not include any Covid-19 losses in our estimate). There was a minimal $1.5 million of prior period
favorable development in the quarter, just below our estimate for $2 million. The underlying combined
ratio of 86.0% beat our 86.4% estimate driven by a better expense ratio, with the underlying loss ratio
coming in slightly above us (at 58.2% versus our 58.1% estimate). WRB didn't repurchase and shares in
the quarter while we had modeled a $35 million buyback. The operating ROE was 17.1% and the net
income ROE was 18.7%. Book value per share was flat QoQ and increased 6.4% YOY in the Q4.

Highlights of Its Pricing Thoughts
Healthy pricing trends persist. WRB saw price increases of 9.3%, excluding workers' comp (they do
not provide the price increase with workers' comp until the 10Q comes out although we estimate that
it was around 8% in the Q4). This compares to the 10.1%, excluding workers' comp (8.8% including
comp), in the Q3 and 9.7%, excluding workers' comp (8.5% including comp), in the Q2. Overall, WRB
described market conditions as remaining favorable, and they do not see that trend changing in
2022. In particular, they see this as a good environment for specialty insurers and even more for the
E&S market, where they continue to see a good flow of opportunities, which they do not think will
be impacted by any new market entrants. Exhibit 2 below shows recent commentary that WRB has
provided on pricing since early 2019.
Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period Pricing Comments
Period Pricing Comments
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace
trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers
comp market, but one needs to be very cautious and most of the growth seen is really being driven by
Q4 2021 payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive on WC pricing in addition to
leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this
stage, particuarly in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any
current opportunities.
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are becoming more
acute. As far as workers' compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is more likely than not to
begin to firm as we make our way into 2021 or sometime next year. The loss ratios that WRB selected at
Q3 2020 the beginning of the year assumed that they would not be outpacing loss cost trend by the level that they
are. The rate increases throughout the year, by and large, are above and beyond what was anticipated.
Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and specifically social inflation, WRB has deliberately decided
to take a wait-and-see attitude.
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which
continues to feel a bit of a growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just
general market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we don't see that trend changing. More
Q3 2021 specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty writers and
even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and
even more so in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse
anytime soon. So that's definitely encouraging.
We saw the firm market accelerate throughout 2019 and it continued to accelerate into 2020, very evident
in Q1. The evidence of this was demonstrated, at least in part by business leaving the standard market,
making its way to the specialty market and in particular, the E&S market. Rate Increases were at a level not
Q2 2020 seen in some number of years and there was a reduction in capacity that various carriers were offering. All
of these things were being driven by two major factors: (1) low interest rate environment and a knock-on
effect for what that means for investment income; and (2) loss cost trends, driven to a great extent by
social inflation, which had been benign for an extended period of time and then crept up on the industry
when it was least expecting it and it has proven to be much more of an issue.
Q2 2021
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines
with the exception of workers; compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace
our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been factoring in a bit more for financial inflation.
It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate increase and
what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior
year. The simple fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look
at the margins that are available in the business, And as we become pleased with the available margins
we start to think about possibly how we re-prioritize exposure of growth versus pushing further on rate.
Q1 2020 Rate increases that continue to progress in response to past conversations around social inflation and
keeping up with loss costs.
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with
the prior two being the early 2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company
sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to take advantage of the hardening market
environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three years, while
most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in
the E&S market, driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2)
expectations for increased audit premiums; and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB
indicated that most all lines are at or approaching rate adequacy with the exception of workers' comp.
Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the example of professional
liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more
recently and workers' comp is in a soft market,
The challenges that the market faces has stemmed from a low interest rate environment, frequency of cat
activity, and social inflation has gotten to the point where it is no longer solely being talked about but it is
actually being acted upon, This is a meaningful sea change that became very visible in the Q4, and there is
Q4 2019 no sign of that slowing down. WRB said that they were excited about what was in front of us. They were
enthusiastic earlier in 2019, and the Q4 2019 built on that enthusiasm. Further WRB said that while there
are some that would suggest that they tend to be an optimistic organization, and that is a fair statement,
the data that they see in their business and the data the industry data supports this optimistic view.
June 2021
Non-Deal
Roadshow
(6/21/21)
The fear factor is on the rise. If a low interest rate environment and consistent global cat activity over the
past several years wasn't enough, it would seem as though social inflation is finally coming into focus for the
broader audience. People are beginning to realize that it is real and it is here. Frequency of severity can no
longer be ignored, both in the property space, but even more so in the casualty space.
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting
meaningful rate increases. And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in
many product lines where we have been getting rate on rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we
think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.
Q3 2019
The market is clearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think
that is very appropriate. And whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and
2002 and 2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is, no cycle looks like any other cyde. When
Q4 2020 WRB looks at Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers' compensation, is
achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are
seeing meaningful firming continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella
market, while property continues to be notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has
been primary GL and but over the past couple of quarters that seems to be building some momentum.
We are seeing rate increases across the board with the exception of workers' comp, which certainly is the
one major product line moving in the other direction. Granted, all these other product lines and the rates
they're getting, they're not moving up all in perfect lockstep, but directionally WRB was pleased to see
Q2 2019 things moving in a positive direction. Further WRB saw an increasing number of examples of business
getting kicked out of the standard market and making its way into the specialty/E&S market and in addition
to that an increasing demand for facultative reinsurance. These are all historically signs or classic indicators
of a firming market particularly when you have all of these pieces lining up the way they seem to be.

Additional Thoughts On The Quarter
See below for an overview of additional thoughts on Q4 2021 earnings versus our estimates.
· Premium growth above us in both insurance and reinsurance/monoline excess. Gross written
premium growth of 24.5% beat our 17.8% estimate (ahead of the +23.2% in the Q3) and net
written premium growth of 26.6% also came in above our 17.9% estimate (and the +23.7% in
Q3). By segment, insurance net written premium growth of 25.8% beat our 18.8% estimate
driven by growth in all lines (with the strongest growth in professional lines, commercial auto,
and other liability), while reinsurance growth of 33% was well above our 11.0% estimate driven by
growth across the board. Earned premium growth of 21.5% was also above our 17.8%. With its
growth, WRB said that ~1/3rd of it came from rates that it is taking, and the remainder came from
exposure growth (new policies and audit premiums).
. NII beats on stronger alternatives. Net investment income of $165.0 million was ahead of our
$131.8 million estimate due to stronger alternative investment income. Core portfolio income of
$107 million was above our $105.5 million estimate, while investment funds of $50.5 million was
also ahead of our $17.6 million, arbitrage trading accounts of $7.5 million did fall below our $8.7
million estimate. The investment yield on the core portfolio was 2.04% was up from 2.00% in Q3,
2.03% in the Q2 and 2.02% in the Q1. After being conservative in recent years, WRB feels it has
the flexibility to take advantage of reinvesting in a rising rate environment as well as extending
portfolio duration.
. Other revenues above us. Revenues from non-insurance businesses was $172 million versus
our $135.0 million estimate (although non-insurance expenses also came in above us), insurance
service fees was $24.3 million just above our $23.0 million estimate, and other income of $1.0
million slightly beat our $0.5 million estimate.
. Combined ratio misses us on higher catastrophe losses. The combined ratio of 88.2% fell short of
our 87.7% estimate due to higher catastrophe losses. The insurance combined ratio was 88.1%, a
slight miss versus our 87.8% estimate and the reinsurance combined ratio of 88.4% came in above
our 87.1% estimate. The loss ratio was 60.4% versus our 59.4% estimate, while the expense ratio
of 27.8% beat our 28.3% estimate and WRB alluded to continued leverage on the expense side as
earned premium continues to grow (there is currently still around a 30-50 basis point benefit from
Covid-19, roughly flat with prior commentary). Catastrophe losses of $48.5 million (2.2 points)
were above our $29.0 million (1.4 point) estimate, with $12 million of Covid-19 losses. We had not
included any Covid-19 losses in our model and this was an uptick from the $6 million of Covid-19
losses booked in Q3.
· Underlying results beat us on better expense ratio. The underlying combined ratio was 86.0%
versus our 86.4% estimate, due to a stronger than forecasted expense ratio, while the underlying
loss ratio of 58.2% was just above our 58.1% estimate, but did improve by 100 basis points from
last Q4. The insurance underlying combined ratio of 85.9% in Q4, was better than our 86.8%
estimate driven by a better expense ratio with the insurance underlying loss ratio coming in at
58.3% versus our 58.8% estimate. The reinsurance underlying combined ratio came in at 58.9%,
short of our 84.0% estimate driven by higher loss costs. The reinsurance underlying loss ratio was
57.2%, above our 53.5% estimate. In getting the segment underlying loss ratios we attribute all of
the favorable reserve development to the insurance segment (WRB provides the breakout of its
reserve development in its 10Q/10K).
· Capital return below us given lack of buyback. WRB did not repurchase shares during the quarter,
versus our 0.4 million shares for $35 million estimate, and the $93 million that was repurchased
in the Q3. Including dividends (regular and special), total capital return was $199.6 million, or
70.2% of operating earnings of $284.3 million. WRB did not provide commentary on the lack of
buyback, but it is not surprising given the company's lack of repurchases in Q2 and favorable view
of underwriting opportunities.

Summary Of Estimate Changes
Estimates Move Higher. See Exhibit 4 below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q4
2021 earnings. Following WRB's conference call, we are raising our 2022 EPS estimate to $5.40 from
$5.10 and our 2023 EPS estimate to $6.10 from $5.70. We are introducing a 2024 EPS estimate of
$6.75. Our higher estimates primarily reflect stronger premium growth and a better expense ratio. We
are currently looking for a 28.5% expense ratio, which is the mid-point of its 28-29% guidance. Every
one point improvement on the expense ratio, represents around $0.40 per share (7.4% of our 2022
EPS estimate). In general, we view this as a bullish quarter and call from WRB as they: (1) pointed to
the healthy market conditions, including the E&S market remain attractive, without much standard
players trying to get into the market and grab, (2) leverage they are seeing on the expense side, even
as Covid-19 savings slow down, and (3) their conservatism as they said they could have probably let
around one point of additional margin fall to the bottom line, but instead they have been conservative
with their ultimate loss pick assumption.

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for WRB: $98.00 from $92.00
Our price target of $98 is based on a 2.0x multiple of our year-end 2023 book value estimate. Our price target also represents a ~16.0x
multiple against our 2023 EPS estimate.
Risk for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe and/or Covid-19 losses.
Investment Thesis
WRB
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases
in 2022 which should translate into underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is currently reflected in consensus
expectations.

recipients in the U.S. this report is being provided by Wells Fargo Securities.
Wells Fargo Securities' research department may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject
companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject
company's common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on
a subject company's common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the
subject company's common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental
investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary
to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to
maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual
investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in Wells Fargo
Securities research reports.
