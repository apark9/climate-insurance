AIG, Inc.
1Q23 Earnings: Growth without Re-
risking
1Q23 growth standouts: Validus Re 40% growth & Lexington
+25% growth. In doing so AIG is not taking outsized risks as it is
not returning its limit profile to former tendencies. AIG values
earnings stability, as depicted by its dividend raise.

Sources of growth in 1Q23: 1.) Validus Re >40% growth given strong 1/1 renewals. 2.) Lexington
(E&S business) >25% growth, a 16th consecutive streak of double-digit rate increases which
compounded >100% during that period. 4/1 renewals: International Property limit profile was
reduced and Japan property cat risk-adjusted rates were up ~20%. AIG is maintaining a prudent
risk posture for Validus Re as it deploys underwriting capacity for 6/1 renewals by aspiring
aggregate limits in Florida to be static. Without added exposure, Validus Re margins should
benefit from significant rate increases and improved terms and conditions. PCG NWP up 57%
y/y: Less reinsurance utilization as AIG transforms this business into a MGA, and PML reductions
(average 40% down by risk return periods.)
NA Commercial Pricing Re-Acceleration: This quarter's 9% pricing (rate and exposure) is up
from 6% in 4Q22. Last quarter AIG shared a 6.5% loss trend expectation. This trend is consistent
with AIG's commentary last quarter that pricing was re-accelerating heading into the new year.
Turning to International, commercial rates (ex exposure) were up to 8% in 1Q23 vs. 4% in 4Q22.

Navigating D&O pricing headwinds: Similar to other market commentary on public D&O, AIG
is seeing pressure with >20% rate declines. AIG mentioned public D&O represents just over 5%
of NA Financial Lines business (or $4.4bn of LTM premiums.) About $200mn of public D&O
premiums feels manageable, however, we do not have context regarding the proportion of
reserves that are public D&O. Per our conversation with IR we understand that AIG did not build
into its 1Q23 financial lines loss picks additional pressure from the banking crisis.

Per our review of schedule P, we observed that AIG took down, more than peers, its AY22 initial
loss picks vs. AY21 current loss picks on both other liability claims made (D&O is one of the
LOBs) and other liability occurrence ('22 Loss Picks May Not Reflect Inflationary Pressures 27
March '23.) AIG's track record of improvements in its NA commercial AYLR since 2020 is a
standout, this quarter is quite notable (59.9% in 1Q23 vs. 63.0% in 4Q22.) However, we also keep
in mind that loss picks can be subjective and can take time to season.
Investment Portfolio Optimization: AIG is no different than CB and ALL who had been more
active sellers of bonds not too long ago in this higher interest rate environment. In doing so, AIG
incurred a $224mn realized loss that should accrete back over time. In fact, AIG already saw

9bps of GI yield improvement 1Q23 and expects incremental yield pickup in 2Q23. When an
insurer talks about classifying bonds at AFS for flexibility purposes but really having a HTM
mindset given ALM frameworks, we look at management actions to make an assessment.
Parent Co. Liquidity: AIG Parent liquidity was $3.9B at March 31, 2023, compared to $3.7bn on
December 31, 2022. In our review of the 10-K, we noticed that the parent company balance
sheet showed $5.3bn of marketable assets. We understand that when AIG refers to parent
company liquidity, it excludes Corebridge and its subsidiaries but includes General Insurance
companies. Therefore, CRBG holding company liquidity needs created a structural layer that AIG
did not have before its L&R separation journey. However that structural layer is lessening given
on May 4th, CRBG's board authorized a $1bn buyback program (without specifying a timeline.)
As AIG is a 77% shareholder of CRBG, we see this step as a self-funded mechanism for L&R
separation and a proof point that this unit has healthy free cash flow generation.
Strategic Actions on Non-Core Businesses: AIG and AFG announced on May 2nd a definitive
agreement for AIG to sell its crop MGA business, Crop Risk Services (CRS), to AFG for $240mn
with a 3Q23 anticipated closing date. Essentially AIG did not have the scale to optimize the
business, not to mention these premiums do not get invested for NII generation. We are curious
if the sale of CRS had anything to do with the timing of the marketing service agreement
between CRS and Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) that would expire next year. AIG's crop
business last year comprised of $1.2bn GWP and $964mn NWP. For FY2023, AIG expects to retain
$800-900mn of earned premiums, of which $750mn will be earned during the balance of 2023.
AIG is also seeking a sale of its health insurance business based in Ireland.
Path to ROCE in double digits: It is important to keep in mind that when AIG talks about
achieving double-digit ROCEs, that reference is on a deconsolidated entity not an outlook on
the current structure where AIG remains a majority owner of CRBG. A leaner operating structure
is a key tenet to get there as AIG reiterated its plans to trim parent expenses by about $250-
350mn (last quarter the midpoint was mentioned), representing ~1-1.5% of premiums, upon
deconsolidation. We note that shareholders equity rose under LDTI adoption, which can
provide a little pressure on the denominator.

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
We view AIG as a wait-and-see
proposition as it goes down the
complex path of deconsolidation as
well as ongoing initiatives to
achieve expense savings objectives.
Upside case
USD 68.00
Eventual successful
deconsolidation that yields a fair
market value resulting in a rerating
of AIG RemainCo. Our upside case
of $68 assumes ~9.5x our '24 EPS
estimate.
Downside case
USD 45.00
Adverse reserve development
accompanying expansion of
underwriting risk appetite too fast
too soon. Our downside case of $45
assumes ~6.3x our '24 EPS
estimate.

1Q Highlights
Underlying combined ratio of 88.7% (82 bps improvement y/y) vs. our estimated 89.1%.
· GI NPW increased 5% y/y due to North American growth (up 17%), somewhat offset by
International growth (down 6%).
· Commercial Lines. International Commercial AYCR deteriorated by 0.2 pts y/y and 2.1 pts
sequentially. NA Commercial AYLR improved 2.7 pts y/y and 3.1 pts q/q. We estimated a
NA Commercial AYLR of 63.0%.
· Personal Lines. NA Personal Lines AYCR was again unprofitable (underlying combined ratio
of 107.6% in 1Q23, 105.4% in 4Q22, 112.8% in 3Q22 and 94.9% in 4Q21.)

Life and Retirement: Within Individual Retirement (IR), base net investment spread was up
2.60% in 1Q23 vs. 2.47% in 4Q22. AIG continues to grow spread business with FA sales up 43%
y/y and up 58% q/q. FIA sales were up 51% y/y and up 18% q/q. PRT sales were strong at $1.5bn
and up from $1.3bn in 4Q22.
Key Results
EPS Beat: AIG's 1Q23 operating EPS of $1.63 was above our $1.24 estimate and $1.43 Street
consensus estimate. We understand that LDTI was not a large driver of the beat. The beat was
driven by better adjusted pre-tax income ($1.6bn vs our $1.4bn due to outperformance across
all operating segments) and better-than-expected GI underlying combined ratio vs our
estimates.
BVPS (common) rose to $58.87 in 1Q23, from $55.15 in 4Q22.
VII: Alternative returns were $141mn (pre-tax) worse than AIG's expectations.
Cat losses: $264mn (net of reinsurance) vs. our $249mn estimate.
Capital Management: Parent liquidity of $3.9bn at the end of the quarter, up from $3.7bn at the
end of 4Q22. $603mn of buybacks were completed during the quarter (vs. our $1,000mn
estimate). Dividend hike. Management increased the quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.36
(up ~13%) for 2Q23, which speaks to earnings stability.
LDTI Recalibration: Under new accounting rules, 2022 operating EPS increased by $0.57, while
stockholders' equity was up by $1.0bn from $39.5bn to $40.5bn and adjusted common
shareholders' equity increased by $1.5bn from $54.2bn to $55.7bn. While higher SHE is good for
leverage, it compresses ROE.
Forward Looking Statements
· PCG: Management expects NPW growth to be at or higher than 1Q23 at 57%, the loss ratio to
meaningfully improve and the acquisition ratio and general operating expense to also
improve.
· International Personal: NPW Growth for the remainder of 2023. 1Q23 growth was obscured
by A&H timing.
· Crop: AIG will continue to write business for the 2023 spring crop season, which ends June
30. AIG expects ~$700-800mn of NPW for 2023, 75% of which booked in the first quarter. For
full year 2023, AIG expects to retain about $800-900mn of NEP, $750mn of which to earn in
over the balance of the year.
Valuation
Our Equal Weight rating and $58 price target (from $55) are based on 9.0x (unchanged) our '24E
EPS of $7.16 (up from $6.17) and 0.53x (down from 0.55x) '24E BVPS (ex AOCI) of $98.91 (up from
$98.55).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
A: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has been lead manager or co-lead manager of a publicly disclosed offer of securities of AIG, Inc. in the previous
12 months.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by AIG, Inc ..
D: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. in the past 12 months.
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from AIG, Inc. within the
next 3 months.
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by AIG, Inc. and/or in any related derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from AIG, Inc. within the past 12 months.
L: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
N: AIG, Inc. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (non-securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an
affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $58 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 9x our 2024 EPS estimate and 0.53x
our 2024 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimate. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given we expect lower ROEs.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a separation.
Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to walk away from
business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings or capital but
undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post separation may temper
AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.
