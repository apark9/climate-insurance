Last quarter's commercial NPW growth is a tough benchmark given significant
reinsurance updates. AIG still had robust commercial NPW growth driven by new
business first (particularly in Lexington), improved retention and rate second, not GDP
growth related so not exposure driven. We are also seeing more balancing of growth
across segments. AIG's underlying combined ratio <90% may now come sooner than
YE22. AIG's traction, particularly on the expense side, now gets us to this target by YE22
for the first time. Our initial hesitation was stacking up AIG to peers with a more
consistent underwriting track record, but that gap is narrowing.
raised 6% from USD 50.00
Blackstone transaction affords more flexibility to sell down >19.9% of L&R. likely in
1Q22 rather than 4Q21. Minority IPO can be >9.9% if market conditions are favorable.
AIG anticipate fees to BX will precede yield enhancements as the L&R asset turnover
rate is approximately 7 years. BX provides origination capabilities but L&R controls the
asset allocation strategy. AIG 200 expense savings somewhat neutralizes the AUM fee
brunt. Our BV estimates include a $3bn after-tax gain from the affordable housing sale
in 4Q. The BX transaction will have an unquantified negative MTM impact to BV.

52 Week range
Capital deployment emphasizes both buybacks ($6bn authorization) and
deleveraging ($2.5bn debt retirements targeted in 2H21), this represents a shift from
our earlier impression of debt reductions first and buybacks second. We understand
this is AIG's first stab at deleveraging, the company still plans to pay a special dividend
with minority IPO proceeds to AIG Inc. to delever further to meet its leverage targets of
<25% at AIG Inc. and 25-30% at L&R.
Raise PT to $53 from $50 and maintain EW rating. We took up our EPS estimates to
reflect the new buyback program, slightly lower borrowing costs with $2.5bn debt
retirements in 2H, 2QA results, and more expedient underlying margin expansion. Our
PT reflects a 50/50 weighting of 10.0x '22 EPS of $5.26 (+$0.12) and 0.7x '22 BVPS ex
AOCI of $75.18 (+$4.6).

Why Equal Weight? We view AIG as a wait-and-see
proposition as it goes down the complex path of
seperating L&R as well as ongoing initiatives to
achieve underwriting margin objectives.
Upside case
USD 57.00
Eventual successful seperation of L&R that yields a
fair market value resulting in a rerating of AIG
RemainCo. If AIG surpasses its underlying combined
ratio < 90% by YE 2022 on a sustainable basis, inc.
AIG 200 execution. Our upside case of $57 assumes
~10.8x our '22 EPS estimate.
Downside case
USD 42.00
Adverse reserve development accompanying
expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too
soon. Our downside case of $42 assumes ~8x our '22
EPS estimate.

Higher Retentions and New Business Counterbalances Rate Moderation
Global Commercial pricing in 2Q21 dropped to +13% from 1Q21 (+15%) and 4Q20 (+15%).
Looking at the segment contributions, International Commercial pricing (+13%) pricing was
down slightly from 1Q21 (+14%) and 4Q20 (+14%) and NA Commercial pricing (+13%)
showed continued moderation vs. 1Q21 (+15%) and 4Q20 (+21%).
While Lexington business showed the steepest rate deceleration, it is noteworthy to
mention that Lexington also had the strongest quarter of new business since AIG has
repositioned its risk appetite in the E&S market. We are less clear if that means AIG has
loosened its risk appetite within Lexington or if compounded rate increases finally reach its
risk return hurdle rate. Overall, AIG saw higher retention and 25% new business in global
commercial.

It is tough to make quarterly pricing comparables for AIG since the composition of its book
has changed significantly over the years. We do not have a good sense if AIG is moving up
its loss picks in concert with rising loss cost trends. However, we do think the company is

building in a reserve margin. Looking at past experience is less meaningful given its current
books looks very different than prior accident years. We have to rely more on management
execution than we typically would like.
Enhanced Catastrophe Management
Within AIG's property catastrophe reinsurance program, the company reduced its per-
occurrence attachment point in NA through strategic cat layers for peak exposures. At June
2021, AIG also reduced Validus Re limits by 40% through its AlphaCat arm. Validus'
catastrophe exposure in FL is marginal at 2% of NPW. Validus increased use of
retrocessions to further reduce its catastrophe exposure. Overall, <25% of AIG's Re NPW is
property.
Key guidance from 2Q21 earnings call
AIG provided a number of modelling considerations for 2Q21 and over a multi-year period.
See below for details:
· BX 9.9% stake in L&R expected to close in September. AIG expects to recognize a
$3bn after-tax gain from the affordable housing sale in 4Q.
· AIG expects to fully utilize its foreign tax credits in 2022 including the portion
that would have expired in 2023, about $1.1-$1.2bn left as of June 30, 2021.
. Pay down $2.5bn in debt in 2H21. AIG already announced for 3Q to retire its
4.875% $1.5bn senior debt due 2022.
· AUM fees to BX will precede yield enhancements as the L&R asset turnover rate
is approximately 7 years. The fee structure is 30 bps on the initial $50bn of AUM,
increasing to 45 bps for the annual new AUM of $8.5 billion starting 4 quarters
later for the reinvested run-off AUM. Therefore, fees are expected to rise from 30
bps initially towards 45 bps by the end of the initial 6-year contract term for
Blackstone's share of the assets.
. Reaffirmed spread compression in the Life & Retirement business of 8 bps to 16
bps a year. With retail mutual fund operation sale closing post June 30th, AIG will
no longer recognize net outflows in this segment.
· Achieving underlying combined ratio <90% may now come sooner than YE22.
· AIG is tracking its $1bn run rate expense savings with $355mn recognized to
date in its P&L.
2Q21 Earnings Review
AIG demonstrated strong results in the second quarter as we are seeing more clearly the
pivot from remediation to growth. AIG beat our expectations of underlying combined ratio
(CR) improvements. Compared to the prior quarter, Gl's underlying CR (91.1%) improved
~130 bps sequentially.
Strong Commercial Growth Moving Parts: NA Commercial and Intl Commercial NPW were
up considerably +15% y/y and +17% y/y, which was down on 1Q21/1Q20 respective
growth of +29% y/y and +20% y/y. In order of magnitude, robust commercial premium
growth driven by new business first, improved retention and rate second, not GDP growth
related so not exposure driven. We understand AIG is not changing its policy limits.
Capital deployment emphasizes both buybacks and deleveraging: AIG upsized its share
repurchase authorization to $6.0bn, including about $900mn remaining under the prior
authorization; AIG repurchased $230mn shares in 2Q21 in line with our estimate. In 2H21,

Barclays | AIG, Inc.
AIG expects to repurchase $2bn of shares and redeem $2.5bn of debt. Parent company
liquidity fell to $7.2bn in 2Q21 from $7.9bn at 1Q21. Parent liquidity does not include yet
the proceeds from the Blackstone transaction.
AIG plans to redeem all of its outstanding 4.875% $1.5bn senior debt due 2022 starting on
September 2, 2021. We are assuming that AIG will partially retire $1bn out of $1.2bn senior
debt due 2035 during 4Q21 to round out its targeted $2.5bn of early debt redemptions
during 2H21.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $53 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 10x our 2022 EPS estimate of
$5.26 and 0.7x YE22 estimated book value per share (ex-AOCI) of $75.18. Our target multiples for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given
we expect lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a
separation. Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to
walk away from business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings
or capital but undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post
separation may temper AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.
