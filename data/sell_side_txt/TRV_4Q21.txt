TRV: Pricing Discussion Sends Shares Higher; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 1/20 to discuss Q4 results. The call focused on
pricing, underlying trends within its businesses, and its expectations for taking price within
personal auto. Our 2022 EPS is unchanged at $12.20, while 2023 goes to $13.65 (from
$13.00), reflecting adjustments to our NII, premium, margin, and tax rate assumptions.
2022 stayed unchanged as we modeled weaker margins in personal auto following the Q4
result. We are also rolling out an initial $15.10 EPS estimate for 2024. Our price target
rises to $172 (from $161) and is based on 1.28x our 2023E book value. TRV [$165.18]
got a lift from earnings coming in above expectations, as well as the company pointing to
earned price continuing to exceed loss trend for some time. We had perhaps expected the
slowdown in earned rate versus loss trend (which went to 1.5 points from 2.0 points this
quarter) to temper the price performance, but that didn't seem to be the case.
· TRV leaves many tea leaves for the rest of earnings-including: (1) commercial lines
pricing slowed (as shown within its renewal rate within BI), which was expected, but
TRV still expects earned rate to stay on top of loss trend for some time; (2) exposure
growth was 4.0%, which was the strongest levels TRV has seen as serves as a good
sign for the insurance brokers (on top of the good print from TFC earlier this week);
(3) within its personal auto book TRV will continue look to take rate over the coming
quarters, and saw the weakest margin that it has seen since Q4 2017, which is a
negative lateral for the other auto insurers; and (4) it was a strong investment income
quarter, driven by alt investments.
· Pricing and loss trend discussion. TRV was positive on commercial lines pricing and
pointed to price remaining above loss trend for some time. In making this comment,
TRV is looking at price through the RPC, which consists of RRC (+5.2% in Q4) and
exposure (+4%). Travelers saw 150bps of rate over loss trend earn into its margins in
the Q4, which decelerated from 200bps over the other three quarters of 2021, and
our expectation is that it will continue to decelerate from here even as rate exceeds
loss trend. TRV continues to assume around 5% loss trend within BI, which has not
changed since Q2 2020.
. Personal lines color unchanged. TRV said it will look to continue to take rate
in personal auto (with 11 rate increases effective since August, and another 25
earmarked for Q1), while Q4 was a strong result in homeowners' that would not
necessarily expect to continue (especially as it deals with elevated weather and
non-weather losses, and realize that Q4 is seasonally the best quarter for property
business). The RPC in auto was only 1.2% in Q4 as TRV has only taken rate in about
20% of its book.
· Aggregate color. TRV placed its aggregate reinsurance cover for 2022 at January
1. The company took up the per event deductible and is also ceding fewer losses to
the reinsurers - it placed 45% of the coverage layer (as compared to 70% in 2022)
of $500 million of losses above a $2 billion retention. We believe the changes in the
treaty do point to price increases that the market saw during the recent renewal
season.
· Other guidance. TRV upped its investment income guide by $10 million a quarter in
2022 as growth in its invested assets will be partially offset by a lower average yield on
the portfolio given the low interest rate environment. The company also pointed to an
expense ratio in the mid-29s in the near term and then trending down to around 29%
(prior estimates for expense ratios was 29.2% in 2022 and 2023).

Commercial Lines Insurance
Equity Research
Summary. TRV hosted a conference call on 1/20 to discuss Q4 results. The call focused on pricing
trends (with commercial and personal lines), underlying trends within its businesses (including the
drivers of the underlying margin improvement within Business Insurance), and its expectations for
taking price within personal auto. Our 2022 EPS estimate is unchanged at $12.20, while 2023 goes
to $13.65 (from $13.00), reflecting adjustments to our investment income, premium, margin, and tax
rate assumptions. 2022 stayed unchanged as we modeled weaker margins in personal auto following
the Q4 result. We are also rolling out an initial $15.10 EPS estimate for 2024. Our price target rises to
$172 (from $161) and is based on 1.28x our 2022E book value.
The quarter in a nutshell. This morning (1/20), TRV reported Q4 core EPS of $5.20, beating both
our $3.98 estimate and the $3.86 consensus estimate. TRV beat on many items including: (1) better
underlying results, (2) lower cat losses (due to recoveries under its aggregate reinsurance cover),
(3) better reserve development, and (4) stronger investment income (principally from its other
investments). This more than offset a higher tax rate, which came in at 19%, higher than our 16.5%
estimate. The underlying combined ratio of 88.7%, beat our 90.2% estimate, with Business Insurance
beating us (Business Insurance saw 1.5 points of earned rate over loss trend, 1.5 points from the
combination of lower property losses and the favorable impact from the pandemic, and around 25bps
from the impact of aggregate recoveries), while Bond & Specialty missed us. Personal Lines was just
above us due to a better expense ratio, while the underlying loss ratio missed us as weaker results in
auto more than offset a strong quarter from the homeowners' business. Net premiums written rose
by 10.1%, beating our 6.7% estimate driven by stronger growth in Business Insurance and Bond &
Specialty, whereas Personal Insurance was pretty close to us. Net investment was $743 million, better
than our $556 million estimate with the majority of the upside due to other investments (the fixed
income investment income was modestly above the guided range for the quarter). Cats were only $36
million (due to $221 million of recoveries under its aggregate reinsurance cover), lower than our $90
million. Repurchases were $600 million, ahead of our $400 million. Book value per share rose by 3.5%
and the core ROE was 19.8%. TRV should get a lift from earnings exceeding expectations.

Takeaways for the Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us, and the laterals for the rest of the group are below.
Net-net, the biggest takes are that TRV pointed to pricing remaining strong within commercial lines
and that personal auto is being affected by frequency trends that are at pre-pandemic levels and
elevated severity (as vehicle replacement and repair costs remain at high levels; see our most recent
CPI note). Highlights of the laterals that we see for the group follow below:
1. Commercial lines pricing remains strong, but is decelerating, with renewal rates up 5.2% in Q4 in
Business Insurance, slowing from 6.3% in Q3, 7.1% in Q2 and rates that were around 8.0% in the
three previous quarters before that. TRV is still getting positive rates in all lines, except workers'
comp, with rates up nearly 7% excluding workers' comp. Rates staying above loss trend is a
positive for the commercial insurers (AIG, CB, HIG, and WRB) and specifically, AIG and CB,
where workers' comp represent a smaller portion of their book, in our view.
2. Underlying margin in Business Insurance benefited from rate exceeding trend, and the favorable impact
of non-cat property losses and the pandemic. TRV said that earned rate exceeded loss trend by
around 1.5 points, which slowed from around 2% over the other three quarters of 2021. This
would be a positive as well for the commercial lines insurers, including AIG, CB, HIG, and WRB.
3. Strong exposure growth. Exposure growth was 4.0%, which was higher than 3.8% in Q3, and is a
bullish sign for the insurance brokers. This adds to the strong lateral we already have from the
strong organic growth quarter from Truist. This appears to be a good sign for all insurance
brokers-given that TRV is more of a small-middle market insurer, it is the best take for AJG
and BRO, but does point to a strong quarter for the group in general.
4. No Covid-19 direct losses were called out. This was the case over the past few quarters as well, and
ties to our overall thought that Covid-19 related losses have largely subsided for the P&C sector.
Travelers did not see direct losses, but did see favorable frequency trends within commercial
auto (which it also highlighted in the Q3 as well). We do not expect to see many, if any, Covid-19
losses from P&C insurers in Q4.
5. Personal auto frequency trends remain at pre-pandemic levels. TRV's Personal Auto book was
affected by frequency trends that remain at pre-pandemic levels. The Personal Auto segment's
underlying margin came in at 103.8%, which was the worst quarter since Q4 2017. The weaker
auto results at TRV point to a weak quarter for the group. We remain cautious on the personal
auto insurers (ALL [Underweight, $119.49] and PGR [Underweight, $107.17]), due to the lack
of pricing in the market and elevated/frequency and severity trends. TRV is looking to take to
continue to take rate in personal auto, and does expect its RPC to rise from the 1.2% in the Q4.
6. Net investment income guide was raised. The company raised its guidance for fixed income
investment income of $430-440 million after-tax on a quarterly basis, up from the prior
$420-430 million This is a good lateral for most (if not all) insurers, in our view.
7. Strong alternative investment quarter. Alternative-related investment income totaled $243
million in Q4, down from $281 million in Q3, but well above our $69 million estimate. We think
alternative-related investment income could surprise to the upside, for both P&C and life
insurers, based on TRV's strong results.
8. Repurchases picked up in Q4. TRV repurchased $800 million in Q4, higher than $600 million in Q3,
and exceeding our $400 million estimate. We expect most insurers, P&C and life, to pick up their
level of buyback activity in the Q4, especially given the attractive valuations across both the
P&C and life insurance sectors.
2022 Soundbites
Highlights of its updated outlook for 2022. Exhibit 2 below highlights TRV's commentary and
expectations for 2022. TRV did not provide much specific 2022 guidance other than fixed income NII,
expense ratio, and general pricing expectations.
. TRV raised its 2022 quarterly fixed income NII to be in the $430-$440 million range on an after-
tax basis, which is up from the $425-$435 million guidance provided in the Q3 earnings call as the
benefit of expected growth in invested assets will be partially offset by lower average yield.
· On the reinsurance side, TRV provided color following renewing its program. TRV highlighted
that its excess of loss reinsurance cover 2022 providing coverage for the $2 billion layer above
the unchanged $3 billion retention. TRV increased its coverage in the $2 billion layer from 75%
to 90%, thus increasing the amount of coverage available from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. TRV
also provided details on the renewal of its Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty. With its
aggregate cover TRV placed 45% of the coverage layer (as compared to 70% in 2021). The treaty

Equity Research
provides aggregate coverage of $225 million for the $500 million of losses above TRV's aggregate
retention of $2 billion. The per event deductible has increased from $5 million in 2021 to $10
million for 2022. Hurricane, wildfire and earthquake events once again have a $250 million per
occurrence cap under its aggregate reinsurance cover.
· In Business Insurance, TRV saw 3.8 points of improvement Y/Y on the underlying combined ratio
where a little more than 1.5 points came from higher earned pricing that continues to exceed
loss cost, 0.5 points from a lower expense ratio, 1.5 from a combination of lower property losses
and a favorable impact associated with the pandemic, and the remainder (25bps) from recoveries
under its aggregate reinsurance cover. With inflation continuing to persist, TRV mentioned it will
continue to take price, and as a result, expects earned pricing to exceed loss trend for some time.
Within BI, rate exceeded loss trend by 1.5 points, which is down from around 2.0 points in Q3, and
compared to 2.0 points in Q2, a little less than 2.0 points in Q1, and over 1.5 points in Q4 2020. We
are modeling for that 1.5 points of earned rate over loss trend to continue to decline from here as
we move through 2022.
. In Bond and Specialty TRV did not lay out specific guidance for the year.
. In Personal lines mentioned that frequency and miles driven are at pre-pandemic levels and that
it will be seeking additional increases in about 25 states throughout the first quarter of 2022
with more actions planned in subsequent quarters. Travelers has taken rate increases in 11 states,
representing around 20% of its auto business, since August 2021.
·
TRV laid out an initial expense ratio target of mid-29s in the near term, essentially flat to 29.4%
2021, while also laying out expectations that the ratio should move down to around 29% over the
next couple of years. We had previously been looking for a 29.2% expense ratio in both 2022 and
2023, and are now looking for expense ratios of 29.4% in 2022, 29.1% in 2023, and 29.0% in 2024.

auto margins offsetting the Q4 quarter, while 2023 goes to $13.65 (from $13.00), and introduce a
2024 EPS estimate of $15.10, reflecting adjustments to our investment income, premium, margin,
and tax rate assumptions. Our price target rises to $172 (from $161) based off 1.28x our 2023E book
value.

· In Q4, the Business Insurance renewal rate change was +5.2%, decelerating from +6.3% last quarter,
and below the +7.1% in Q2 2021, +8.0% in Q1, and +8.3% in Q4 2020. Exposure growth was +4.0%,
versus +3.8 last quarter, +2.9% in Q2 2021, +1.3% in Q1, and -0.1% in the Q4 2020. Exhibits 4 and
5, below, show the recent trends in TRV's quarterly domestic Business Insurance (BI) renewal rate
change. Travelers, for its part, seemed positive on the forward pricing outlook and said that some
part of the RPC acts as rate. This is why TRV expects earned pricing to exceed loss trend within
Business Insurance for some time.
· TRV stopped providing forward guidance on its RPC (in the summer of 2020), as the company was
unsure of how the economy would be affected by Covid-19. The company has yet to bring back
RPC forward guidance, but has pointed to margin improvement, as Business Insurance earned rate
remains in excess of loss trend. Our assumption is the exposure bucket of the RPC remains positive
in Q1 2022 with some flattening as we navigate through 2022, especially as we come up against
some tough comps when the economy started to improve post the pandemic lows.

Personal Lines-TRV Continues To Take Price in Auto and Home
· Within Personal Insurance, TRV saw a modest acceleration in rate in personal auto in the quarter,
as pushes for price. The RPC in auto was +1.2% in Q4, versus flat last quarter, +0.5% in Q2, +0.6%
in Q1, and +0.8% in Q4. On the auto side, TRV said that auto driving frequency remains at pre-
pandemic levels and that it is anticipating rate increases in 25 different states in the Q1 (following
taking rate in 11 states since August 2021) with more actions planned in the subsequent quarters.
The company did note that it has been successful so far in getting the rates it needs approved
with a few states being anomalies such as California. The RPC however was modest at 1.2% as TRV
only got rate in about 20% of states that it is writing business in so far. This ties into our theme
that we need to see more rate going through more of the personal auto premium base, not just
for Travelers, but across the auto insurance industry. See our recent note on personal auto pricing
trends.
· Homeowners' pricing was relatively flat sequentially and up Y/Y at 8.7% in the Q4, compared to
8.8% last quarter, 8.1% in Q2, 7.5% in Q1, and 8.1% in Q4. On the home side, TRV said it will look to
take rate as homeowners product lines continue to experience elevated weather and non-weather
loss activity as well as taking into account labor and material-related inflation.
· Travelers' new business in auto decreased 6.1% sequentially, but was slightly up when compared
to last year, with auto new business premiums totaling $279 million, versus $297 million in Q3,
$299 million in Q2, $278 million in Q1, and $269 million in Q4 2020. New business was down
sequentially and flat Y/Y in home in the quarter at $273M, versus $312 million last quarter, and
$272 million last Q4.

$36 million were better than our $90 million estimate, while favorable reserve development of
$95 million was better than our estimate for favorable development $59 million, due to better-
than-expected PYD in Business Insurance (from workers' compensation) and Bonds & Specialty.
The underlying combined ratio of 88.7% was favorable to our estimate of 90.2%, and in line with
last year. Underlying results beat us in Business Insurance (due to earned pricing exceeding loss
cost trends, a favorable impact associated with the pandemic as well as favorable impact of non-
cat weather, and a lower expense ratio) and Personal Insurance (due to a lower expense ratio), while
Bond & Specialty was above us due to a higher than expected PYD. Within auto, the underlying
combined ratio rose by 5.6 points due to higher losses due to comparison to a lower level of
loss activity in the prior year quarter as a result of the pandemic and to a lesser extent, elevated
severity.
. Catastrophe losses totaled $36 million, well below our $90 million estimate as losses were reduced
by $255 million under its aggregate reinsurance treaty.TRV did note that catastrophe losses
primarily resulted from tornado activity in Kentucky, windstorms in multiple states and a wildfire in
Colorado.
. Prior year favorable reserve development came in at $95 million, better than our estimate of $59
million, due to higher releases in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty. Business Insurance
saw favorable development of $74 million, better than our estimate for a release of $44 million,
which was driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic operations in workers' comp
product for multiple accident years. Bond & Specialty saw a release of $24 million (better than our
estimate for no development), due to better-than-expected loss experience in fidelity and surety
for recent accident years. Personal Lines saw unfavorable development of $3 million (worse than
our estimate for reserve releases of $14 million) due to adverse development within auto.

Price Target Basis and Risk
Price Target for ALL: $105.00
Our price target of $105 represents around a 1.03x multiple on our 2023 book value per share estimate of approximately $102.
Risk for ALL
Risks to the upside include margins coming in above expectations if severity and/or frequency trends are better-than-expected, if the
elevated severity trends abate much quicker than expected, and if policy and premium growth coming in above expectations.
Price Target for PGR: $85.00
Our $85 price target is based on (1) about a 2.1x multiple of our 2023 GAAP book value estimate of around $40.50 per share and (2) just
above 14.7x our 2023 EPS estimate.
Risk for PGR
Risks to the upside include continued favorable frequency trends, an improvement in severity trends, and stronger-than-anticipated
premium and policy growth.
Price Target for TRV: $172.00 from $161.00
Our price target of $172 is based on around a ~1.28x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $135 and 12.6x our
2023 EPS estimate of $13.65.
Risk for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.
Investment Thesis
ALL
We believe ALL's margins have peaked and the company should be impacted by elevated severity trends and a spike in frequency as driving
picks up, both of which should pressure its margins. As margins are constrained by the higher loss trends, we believe valuation could
contract and thus have an Underweight rating on the shares.
PGR
We have an Underweight rating on the shares. As Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out and driving picks up, frequency should revert back to
more normalized levels, which combined with elevated severity trends, should cause pressure margins for PGR over the remainder of 2021
and into 2022, in our view. Further, PGR's policy growth should slow as there is less shopping in the market as most players advertise less
and look to lower top-line growth in response to the higher loss trend. The combination of weaker margins and slowing top-line growth
should cause the PGR shares to underperform the insurance sector.
TRV
We believe that TRV will benefit from one of the hardest commercial pricing environment since 2003. Although we are positive on the
commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers due to its smaller account exposure and higher workers'
comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation, lower
reserve releases, and Covid-19, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral
and rate its shares Equal Weight as a result.

Asset Investors, LLC ("SAI"), an investment adviser subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co. If you are paying directly for this research, it is being provided by SAI. For all other
recipients in the U.S. this report is being provided by Wells Fargo Securities.
Wells Fargo Securities' research department may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject
companies on which Wells Fargo Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject
company's common equity may trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on
a subject company's common equity does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the
subject company's common equity may perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental
investment rating and price target for a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary
to our fundamental investment rating and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to
maintain, update or close out short-term trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual
investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in Wells Fargo
Securities research reports.
