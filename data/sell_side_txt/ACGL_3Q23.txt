Arch Capital
Firing on All Cylinders
ACGL reported robust 3Q23 results, marked by upside in EPS, strong
margins, and higher than assumed premiums. We consider Arch a premier
franchise, but are Neutral on the stock due to valuation. Still, we feel that ACGL
is the best name for those seeking to invest in the hard pricing theme.
· Sizable EPS beat; raising forecasts. ACGL announced 3Q23 operating EPS
of $2.31, significantly above our $1.48 estimate and consensus of $1.55.
Compared to our model, the upside was driven partly by more favorable prior-
year development ($0.13 variance) and lower catastrophe losses ($0.08
variance). Still, EPS would have handily beaten projections, helped by
favorable underlying loss trends and, to a lesser extent, higher investment
income. We are raising our 4Q23 EPS projection from $1.60 to $1.70 and our
2024 forecast from $6.91 to $7.11.
· Business trends exceeded relatively high expectations. Reinsurance results
were marked by robust margins (CR 80.0% versus our 90.3% estimate) and
strong premium growth (NWP up 45%, exceeding our 36% assumption).
Margins were better than assumed in the insurance division as well (CR 90.9%
vs. 93.6%E), but premium growth was weaker (NWP +11% vs. +15%E). As
in recent quarters, insurance premiums increased across most product lines
except for professional lines, which is suffering from soft pricing and weak
demand. Mortgage insurance margins were robust as well (CR 4.7% vs.
38.0%E), helped by favorable development (CR ex. PYD 38.2% vs. 45.0%E),
while premium growth was weak (NWP -2% vs. - 6%E). As assumed, ACGL
did not repurchase stock in the third quarter. Management commentary on the
operating environment was upbeat.
. Our long-term outlook for ACGL is mixed, but we forecast the company
to report robust results in the near term. We expect strong margins and top-
line growth in the reinsurance business, and healthy margins but weak
premium growth in the MI business. In the MI division, reserve releases related
to COVID delinquencies should wane, but we expect ongoing favorable
development due to the strong labor market and increase in house prices. While
higher interest rates are suppressing top-line growth in the MI business, they
are a tailwind for margins. Meanwhile, results in the re/insurance business
should benefit from firm pricing. Still, we expect additional capacity to enter
the reinsurance market over the next 1-2 years and remain skeptical of a
sustained hard market. Our model assumes no share repurchases over the next
few quarters given ACGL's current stock price and management's intent to
deploy capital into the business amid the favorable pricing backdrop.
J.P. Morgan
· We maintain our Neutral rating. In our view, ACGL is a top-tier franchise,
but in commoditized markets. We believe that ACGL is among the best
positioned carriers to take advantage of hard reinsurance pricing. Still, our
long-term outlook for the reinsurance market is cautious. Also, we believe that
ACGL's valuation is full given its long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Arch is a premier re/insurance franchise with a track record of
higher and less volatile underwriting margins than most peers.
Still, we are Neutral given our cautious long-term outlook for the
P&C reinsurance market and the stock's valuation. In our view,
near-term results in the MI business will be marked by weak
premium growth and moderating margins as reserve releases
moderate. Over time, we expect MI returns to be held back by the
commoditized nature of the product, black box pricing, and
higher capital requirements. In P&C reinsurance, hard pricing
and tighter terms/conditions should boost underwriting results
in the near term, but our long-term outlook is negative as we
expect the entry of additional capacity in the next 1-2 years to
preclude a sustained hard market.

We view ACGL as the best investment for those seeking to take advantage of the
firm pricing theme but are Neutral on the stock due to valuation. In our view,
ACGL has an industry-leading reinsurance business with a unique culture and approach
to underwriting that should produce above-average and less volatile margins over time.
Also, Arch is a top competitor in the mortgage insurance (MI) market, which we
consider a structurally better business than P&C reinsurance. In primary P&C, ACGL
has gained share and expanded margins, helped by firm prices. We expect ACGL's near-
term results to benefit from higher prices and tighter terms/conditions in the reinsurance
market. In MI, our model projects moderating, but healthy, margins and weak premium
growth. Despite our near-term optimism, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance
market remains cautious because of structural concerns such as low barriers to entry and
limited pricing power. We expect additional capacity to enter the market in the next 1-2
years and remain skeptical of sustained hard prices. Moreover, investor sentiment on the
stock is very bullish and its valuation seems full.
P&C Reinsurance: Near-Term Outlook Positive; L-T Cautious
We expect ACGL's reinsurance results in the near term to benefit from hard
pricing and tighter terms, but our long-term outlook for the market is cautious.
Arch has historically generated better and less volatile margins than most reinsurers,
which we attribute to its focus on specialty reinsurance (where pricing tends to be less
competitive), conservative underwriting, ability to shift mix based on changing market
conditions, and judicious management of catastrophe risk. In particular, ACGL prices
business using the risk-free rate (leading to more conservative underwriting) and uses a
long-term compensation plan for underwriters that pays based on underwriting margins
over a multi-year period. Furthermore, the creation of 3rd party capital vehicles such as
Premia Re has allowed Arch to earn fee income. Overall, we consider Arch a top-tier
reinsurer and expect firm pricing to boost results through 2024. Still, our long-term
outlook for the reinsurance market is cautious given its commoditized nature, the ease of
entry of new capital, and a broad set of capital providers (including some, such as
pension funds, with lower return thresholds). We are skeptical of prolonged hard pricing
and believe that 1-2 years of strong margins will attract new capacity into the market. In
our view, any signs of additional capacity entering the market would hurt investor
sentiment on reinsurance stocks, which have become consensus longs since late 2022.
MI: Margins to Moderate but Stay Healthy; Growth Weak
ACGL expanded in mortgage insurance through acquisitions (CMG in 2014 and United
Guaranty in 2016) when market conditions were favorable, marked by appreciating
home prices, stringent lending standards at mortgage issuers, and disciplined pricing by
mortgage insurers. Arch's MI business has generated healthy margins since then and,
despite the temporary setback from COVID-related delinquencies in 2020, results have
been strong. In our opinion, MI margins will remain healthy in the near term, but will
moderate from recent levels as the benefit of COVID-related reserve releases tapers off.
Still, margins should remain healthy overall given the strong labor market and
appreciation of house prices. Although higher interest rates should suppress mortgage
origination volumes, they bode well for margins as they are extending duration of
policies and prompting homeowners to stay in their houses (where they have built
considerable equity) longer than in recent years.

3Q23 Details
This evening, ACGL announced third quarter operating EPS of $2.31, well above our
$1.48 estimate and consensus of $1.55. Compared to our model, underwriting income
was better than assumed in all three divisions, and was especially strong in reinsurance
and mortgage insurance. Margins were lifted by favorable prior-year development, but
were stronger than assumed on a core basis as well. Also, investment income was
slightly higher than our forecast.

Business trends exceeded high expectations. Reinsurance results were marked by
robust margins (CR 80.0% versus our 90.3% estimate) and strong premium growth
(NWP up 45%, exceeding our 36% assumption). Margins were better than assumed in
the insurance division as well (CR 90.9% vs. 93.6%E), but premium growth was weaker
(NWP+11% vs. +15%E). As in the past few quarters, management indicated that
insurance premiums rose across all major market segments with the exception of
professional lines, which continues to suffer from soft pricing. Mortgage insurance
margins were robust as well (CR 4.7% vs. 38.0%E), helped by favorable development
(CR ex. PYD 38.2% vs. 45.0%E), while premium growth was weak (NWP -2% vs. -
6%E). As anticipated, Arch did not repurchase stock in the quarter.

Mortgage Ins .: Favorable Development Drove Robust Margins
We expect mortgage insurance (MI) results to be marked by weak premium
growth, healthy persistency, and strong (but lower) margins. Higher interest rates
should suppress mortgage insurance volumes. Also, we expect moderating reserve
releases from cures of COVID-related delinquencies to drive a decline in margins to
more normal levels in the next few quarters. However, division results were
significantly better than assumed in the third quarter and, although we believe that
margins in the business will eventually moderate, there could be ongoing upside in the
near term. The MI division generated underwriting income of $283 million in 3Q23,
well above our $171 million estimate, driven by upside in margins (CR 4.7% vs.
38.0%E) and higher earned premiums (+3.9% from 3Q22 vs. - 5.3%E). The upside in
margins was due to a lower attritional loss ratio (21.4% vs. 25.0%E), much greater than
assumed favorable reserve releases (-33.5% vs. - 7.0%E), and a lower expense ratio
(16.8% vs. 20.0%E). On a core basis, CR ex. cats and PYD was 38.2%, also better than
our 45.0% assumption. Management attributed the reserve releases to better than
expected cure rates and more favorable assumptions (lower average per claim reserve
and lower ultimate loss per notice of default) for business issued in accident years 2020-
2022. Meanwhile, attritional losses benefited from lower estimated claim rates, partially
offset by higher new delinquencies. Similar to recent periods, the negative for MI was
gross written premiums, which decreased -4.0%, the fourth consecutive quarterly
decline. Net written premiums declined as well (-1.8%), but not as much as gross
written premiums due to higher retentions and growth in the credit risk transfer
business, which offset lower mortgage originations in the Australia segment.

In 2020 and early 2021, MI margins were hurt by artificially high delinquencies caused
by homeowners availing of government forbearance programs. However, after an initial
spike in 2Q20, the number of delinquent loans has steadily declined. With the expiry of
the forbearance programs, a significant portion of previously delinquent loans has cured,
particularly loans by borrowers who were taking advantage of the mortgage payment
holiday but were not in financial distress. Meanwhile, higher house prices have provided
a cushion to homeowners under stress who are struggling to pay their mortgages,
limiting losses for MI carriers. The percent of loans in default in the U.S. primary MI
business was 1.7% at 9/30/23, slightly up from 1.6% at 6/30/23 and flat with 1.7% at
9/30/22.

In our view, MI margins will continue to benefit from reserve releases, but to a
lesser extent than in recent quarters. Higher reported delinquencies at the onset of
COVID led Arch and its MI peers to establish corresponding reserves despite the
healthy labor market and appreciation in house prices. A meaningful portion of these
delinquencies was due to homeowners taking advantage of the government's
forbearance protection programs (to preserve liquidity), not actual financial hardship.
Under U.S. GAAP accounting, Arch had to establish reserves based on reported
delinquencies despite the high likelihood that the delinquencies would eventually cure
(unlike other P&C lines an IBNR component is disallowed under U.S. GAAP for
primary MI business). With most of these delinquent loans curing following the
expiration of forbearance programs (initially set for 12/31/20, but then extended through
9/30/21 and, in some cases, year-end 2021 or beyond), ACGL has been releasing these
previously incurred reserves. Currently, more than 80% of MI reserves are from
accident years after COVID, suggesting less of a benefit from the release of reserves
related to COVID delinquencies. Despite an expected decline, we project MI margins to
remain healthy given the strong labor and housing markets, cures on previously
delinquent loans, and the equity cushion accumulated by homeowners due to the
appreciation in house prices. Higher interest rates are a positive for margins as well as
they are resulting in homeowners' staying in their existing houses (where they have
more equity) longer then typical and are thereby improving persistency in the MI book.
On a cautious note, top-line growth is likely to be weak as higher interest rates reduce
mortgage originations. While a weaker economy could deflate home prices and lead to
higher mortgage defaults, a material uptick in losses seems unlikely in the near term.
Barring a recession, we expect core margins to stay healthy, though declining reserve

releases will drive margins and earnings lower even if economic trends stay favorable.
ACGL has become a leading competitor in the MI market through acquisitions and
could expand further via M&A, although deals seem unlikely in the near term.
ACGL entered the mortgage re/insurance business in 2011 but was only marginally
involved in the market at the onset, competing as a primary insurer through credit
unions and as a reinsurer through the GSE credit risk transfer program. The company's
2014 acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance from Cuna Mutual gave it a bigger
foothold as it received a ratings upgrade for its MI business (from BBB+ to A- at S&P)
and gained distribution in the bank channel. Following the deal, Arch became a top 10
competitor in the domestic private MI market. Arch's market position strengthened
further following its 2017 acquisition of United Guaranty (UGC) from AIG, which
catapulted it to a top-3 spot (as part of the deal AIG retained 50% of mortgage insurance
blocks originated by UGC pre 2017). Arch has also expanded in foreign MI markets
through M&A, including its acquisition of Westpac's mortgage insurance business in
Australia (closed in August 2021).
Insurance: Strong Margins Offset Weaker Premiums
The insurance business reported strong underwriting margins and lower than
expected written premium growth. In 3Q23, the division reported underwriting
income of $129 million, well above our $90 million estimate, due to upside in margins
(CR 90.9% vs. 93.6%E). Net earned premium growth (+19.0% vs. +18.8%E) was
roughly in-line. Most of the margin beat was from lower catastrophe losses (2.6% vs.
4.0%E), but favorable development (-0.8% vs. - 0.3%E), a lower attritional loss ratio (
55.7% vs. 55.9%E), and a lower expense ratio (33.4% vs. 34.0%E) contributed as well.
Net written premiums grew +11.2% from 3Q22, slower than our +14.9% assumption.
Management noted that net written premium growth benefited from new business,
higher prices, growth in existing accounts, and higher reinsurance retentions, partly
offset by a decline in professional lines writings, where pricing has been more
challenging.

J.P.Morgan
Arch's primary P&C business is benefiting from favorable pricing, but we expect
margin improvement in the business to be less than implied by price hikes. After
shrinking its "cycle managed" business (now called as wholesale/large capacity) from
2012 to 2017, ACGL is seeing strong growth in this part of its primary book, driven by
price hikes in the broader market, particularly E&S. Results in less opportunistic parts
of ACGL's book (specialty small/middle market and franchise) have been healthy as
well. High inflation and rising reinsurance costs are driving an uptick in insurance
pricing, especially in property and cat-exposed lines. Despite the increase in prices, we
do not anticipate a material improvement in primary commercial lines margins at Arch
and peers due to headwinds from higher inflation and reinsurance costs. Management
teams at insurance underwriters as well as many investors are optimistic about
improving non-cat margins at commercial insurers, but we feel that assessing results on
a non-cat basis is not as relevant given the significant increase in reinsurance retentions
at primary companies. On an overall combined ratio basis, results for most primary
insurers have been weak through 2023 given elevated cat losses. In contrast, reinsurers'
cat losses have not increased to the same extent. We feel that consensus EPS forecasts
for commercial lines insurers do not adequately reflect the shift in cat loads from
reinsurers to primary carriers following the uptick in retention levels with 1/1/2023
reinsurance renewals.
Reinsurance: Robust Results, Near-Term Outlook Positive
The reinsurance business reported robust margins and premium growth.
Underwriting income in 3Q23 was $310 million, much higher than our $147 million
assumption, reflecting strong underwriting margins (CR of 80.0% vs. 90.3%E). The
attritional loss ratio (49.9% vs. 58.3%E), catastrophe losses (9.3% vs. 10.0%E), and the
expense ratio (9.3% vs. 10.0%E) were favorable compared to our model, and only partly
offset by slightly lower favorable reserve development (-2.8% vs. - 5.0%E). On a core
basis, the combined ratio (ex. cats and PYD) came in at 73.5%, better than our 85.3%
assumption. Net written premium growth was strong, up 44.8% to $1.6 billion, above
our +36.3% assumption, which management attributed to growth in property coverage
(ex. cats) and other specialty lines, as well as higher retentions. Management sounded
upbeat on Arch's positioning amid capacity constraints at some competitors, and noted
that it expects the prices and terms/conditions to remain firm longer than previous hard
market cycles. Also, ACGL affirmed our view that most primary insurers are retaining
more risk given higher reinsurance pricing, implying higher potential catastrophe loads
for primary insurers and lower for reinsurers relative to historical levels.

We remain skeptical of sustained hard reinsurance pricing, but market trends are holding
up better than our initial expectations and we believe that Arch is better positioned than
peers in the current environment. ACGL's reinsurance segment was initially established
to take advantage of the hard market for casualty coverage in the early 2000s. Over the
years, however, management has shifted Arch Re's business mix away from casualty
risks towards other specialty lines such as surety, accident and health, agriculture, and
trade credit, which are generally less competitive and have more attractive risk-reward.
The hard pricing environment has boosted results in recent years and should drive
continued strong premiums and margins in the near term. Still, we expect the pace of
price hikes to moderate longer term and remain skeptical of a sustained hard reinsurance
market given the expected entry of additional capacity. Factors that contributed to a
multi-year soft market prior to 2018 (glut of capital, greater fluidity/speed of capital,
more providers of capacity, broker consolidation) are still prevalent, and should
preclude a prolonged hard reinsurance market. On a positive note, ACGL's reinsurance
results could benefit from the release of COVID-related reserves, a significant
proportion of which remain in IBNR. Similarly, loss reserves for Ian could ultimately
prove to be too conservative (most primary companies booked lower Ian-related losses
than reinsurers).
Increasing EPS Estimates
We are raising 4Q23 EPS from $1.60 to $1.70 and 2024 EPS from $6.91 to $7.11.
Our 2023 EPS forecast is increasing as well, from $6.73 to $7.66. Our updated estimates
mainly reflect better than expected loss experience, even excluding the impact of
catastrophes and prior year development. We consider catastrophe losses (which would
affect reinsurance and insurance margins) and housing market trends (which affect MI
margins and premium growth) the key sources of potential variance in reported results
and our projections.

Arch Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $86.00)
Investment Thesis
We view Arch as a premier re/insurance franchise, but are Neutral on the stock due
to bullish investor sentiment and current valuation. In our opinion, ACGL has an
industry-leading reinsurance business that will generate superior and less volatile
underwriting margins over time due to its unique culture and approach to the market. Also,
Arch is a top competitor in mortgage insurance (MI), which we consider structurally better
than P&Creinsurance. In the near term, we expect MI results to be marked by weak premium
growth and compressing, but healthy, margins as reserve releases taper off. Meanwhile, hard
pricing should boost premium growth and margins in the reinsurance segment. On the other
hand, our long-term outlook for the reinsurance business remains cautious and we are
skeptical of sustained hard pricing given structural issues such as low barriers to entry,
increased participation by third-party capital, and limited pricing power. Furthermore,
investor sentiment on ACGL is very bullish and the stock's valuation is not compelling
relative to the company's long-term ROE and EPS growth potential.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2024 price target from $82 to $86 to reflect updated EPS
and book value forecasts. Our price target assumes a 1.5x multiple on our 12/31/24E BV ex.
AOCI forecast, a 1.6x multiple on our 12/31/24E BV forecast, and an 11.0x multiple on our
2025 EPS estimate, and we corroborate this approach with a sum-of-the-parts analysis that
values ACGL's re/insurance business separately from mortgage insurance. Our target
multiples for ACGL reflect its current business mix, which has become more skewed to
mortgage insurance. ACGL trades at 2.2x BV and 11.7x 2024E EPS compared to 1.6x and
8.5x for the reinsurance sector, 1.0x and 7.8x for MI peers, and 2.0x and 11.4x for the broader
P&C group.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
In our opinion, ACGL could outperform and exceed our price target if:
· Re/insurance pricing stays firm for an extended period. A prolonged hard market
could drive upside to our EPS estimates and lift sentiment on the stock.
· Management sustains insurance underwriting margins close to the recent level. In
our view, investor sentiment could improve if ACGL is able to sustain insurance
combined ratios in the low to mid 90s, a significant improvement from ~100%
previously, even as the tailwind from the current hard market recedes.
We feel that the stock could underperform the group and fail to reach our target if:
· Additional capacity enters the reinsurance market. This, in turn, could result in a
reversal in pricing trends and potentially drive a reduction in EPS estimates as well as
hurt sentiment on the sector.
· The housing market deteriorates. Given Arch's meaningful exposure to mortgage
insurance and the more systematic nature of mortgage insurance risk, rising
unemployment, higher mortgage defaults, and decreasing home values would pressure
the company's results and hurt sentiment on the stock.
· The pace of reserve development moderates. Favorable reserve development has
been a notable contributor to ACGL's results in recent years. A slowdown in the pace
of development could pressure margins and returns.

analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock
because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the
price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India)
and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country
market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying
analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
