W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
WRB: A Good Quarter from Berkley; Q1 EPS and Conference Call Round-Up
Our Call
Summary. WRB reported Q1 2022 EPS of $1.10 beating both our estimate of $1.09 and
consensus of $0.95. The upside was mainly due to: (1) better underwriting income due
to a modestly better expense ratio (coming in at 28.3%, better than our 28.5% estimate
and below the mid-point of the 28-29% guidance, (2) a lower tax rate, which came in at
19.0% better than our 21.0% estimate due to a one-time benefit from the release of a
valuation allowance arising from utilization of tax attributes. This was counter-balanced
by lower investment income than we had expected. Catastrophe losses came in at $28.8
million, just above our $27.2 million estimate. There was a minimal $1 million of prior
period favorable development in the quarter, just below our estimate for adverse reserve
development of $0.5 million.
· Estimates go higher on better NII. Following WRB's conference call, we are raising our
2022 EPS estimate to $4.00 from $3.90 while our 2023 EPS estimate goes to $4.70
from $4.40, and our 2024 EPS estimate goes to $5.50 from $5.00 primarily reflecting
higher investment income (as the new money rate is now 100 basis points above the
portfolio yield). Our 2024 EPS estimate goes to $5.55 from $5.00. We are raising our
price target to $80 from $76, which is based on 2.4x our 2023 book value per share
estimate. Shares of WRB should trade up tomorrow reflecting the earnings beat.
· Healthy pricing, but slowing. WRB saw price increases of 8.3% in the Q1 excluding
workers' comp. This is a decline from 9.3% in Q4, 10.1% in Q3, and 9.7% in Q2. Overall,
WRB described market conditions as favorable, and they do not see that trend
changing. In particular, they see this as a good environment for specialty insurers and
especially within the E&S market. Further, while the impact of rate over trend was
60 basis points on the loss ratio in the quarter WRB said that the impact is really in
the hundreds of basis points, but they are being conservative in how they book their
margins given the high inflationary environment.
· Additional positive market color. WRB said that new business is being priced at
around 2% more than renewals. Further, its renewal retention ratio is at around 82%,
which is favorable to them as it shows they are not churning the book to drive the top-
line growth. Further, WRB described the market as shaping up for a strong remainder
of 2022 and also a very strong 2023 (and most likely 2024 as well).
· Underlying margin improvement driven by the loss and expense ratio. The
underlying combined ratio was 86.6%, better than our 86.9% estimate. The underlying
loss ratio of 58.3% (versus our 58.4%) improved by 60 basis points from last Q1 and
was in line with the Q4. The expense ratio came in at 28.3%, better than our 28.5%
estimate, and below the midpoint of the guided 28-29%.
· Strong double-digit premium growth. WRB saw net premiums written growth
of 17.7%, coming in above our 16.4% estimate, and while it did slow from 24.5%
in Q4 it was within the 15-25% range WRB has talked about growth being in. By
segment, insurance net written premium grew by 19.2% beating our 18.2% estimate
and reinsurance growth of 9.6% beat our 6.4% estimate. Within insurance, WRB saw
healthy growth in all lines, with the strongest growth coming from other liability
(+27.1%), short-tail lines (+21.2%), professional lines (+17.4%) and commercial
auto (+12.5%). Reinsurance growth was driven by casualty and monoline excess, as
property reinsurance declined.

Q1 2022 In A Nutshell
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q1 2022 EPS of $1.10 beating both our estimate of $1.09 and
consensus of $0.95. The upside was mainly due to: (1) better underwriting income due to a modestly
better expense ratio (coming in at 28.3%, better than our 28.5% estimate and below the mid-point
of the 28-29% guidance, (2) a lower tax rate, which came in at 19.0% better than our 21.0% estimate
due to a one-time benefit from the release of a valuation allowance arising from utilization of tax
attributes. This was counter-balanced by lower investment income than we had expected. Investment
income came in at $173.5 million, below our $207.7 million estimate due to weaker returns within its
investment funds (as we had assumed a 25% return and the return came in at 13.8%).
Catastrophe losses came in at $28.8 million, just above our $27.2 million estimate. There was a
minimal $1 million of prior period favorable development in the quarter, just below our estimate for
adverse reserve development of $0.5 million. The underlying combined ratio of 86.5% beat our 86.9%
estimate driven by a better expense ratio, with the underlying loss ratio coming in slightly better than
us (at 58.3% versus our 58.4% estimate). WRB didn't repurchase any shares in the quarter while we had
modeled a $50 million buyback. The operating ROE was 18.2% and the net income ROE was 35.5%.
Book value per share rose 3.2% QoQ and increased 7.4% YOY in the Q1.
Showing the conservatism within its margins, WRB highlight that the paid loss ratio was 45.3%, better
when compared to 48.2% in Q1 2021, 56.1% in 2020, 54.2% in 2019, 58.8% in 2018 and 55.5% in
2017. Further, WRB said that the impact of rate over loss trend is really in the hundreds of basis points,
versus the 60 basis points booked in the quarter, but they are being conservative in how they book
their margins given the high inflationary environment.

Highlights of Its Pricing Thoughts
Healthy pricing trends persist, even with some deceleration. WRB saw price increases of 8.3%,
excluding workers' comp (they do not provide the price increase with workers' comp until the 10Q
comes out although we estimate that it was around 6.5% in the Q1). This compares to the 9.3%,
excluding workers' comp (8.1% including comp), in the Q4 and 10.1%, excluding workers' comp (8.8%
including comp), in the Q3. Overall, WRB described market conditions as remaining favorable, and they
do not see that trend changing in 2022. In particular, they see this as a good environment for specialty
insurers and even more for the E&S market, where they continue to see a good flow of opportunities,
which they do not think will be impacted by any new market entrants. Exhibit 2 below shows recent
commentary that WRB has provided on pricing since H2 2019.
Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period Pricing Comments
Period Pricing Comments
The market is dearly in the throes of firming. When WRB looks at the marketplace overall, they think that is
very appropriate. And whether it proves to be similar to what we saw in sort of late 2001 and 2002 and
2003, we will only see with time. But the reality is, no cycle looks like any other cycle. When WRB looks at
Q4 2020 Q4 every product line at this stage, with the exception of workers' compensation, is achieving rate in excess
of loss cost trends, which they view as appropriate and necessary. They are seeing meaningful firming
continuing in much of the PL market as well as the excess and umbrella market, while property continues to
be notably hard and auto is also quite firm. One of the laggards has been primary GL and but over the past
couple of quarters that seems to be building some momentum.
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis
points. New business pricing is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains
Q1 2022 well within range and will continue to take rate as weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very
strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market eroding any current
opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.
The drivers of the firming marketplace, with the exception of workers' compensation, are becoming more
acute. As far as workers' compensation goes WRB expects that that marketplace is more likely than not to
begin to firm as we make our way into 2021 or sometime next year. The loss ratios that WRB selected at
Q3 2020 the beginning of the year assumed that they would not be outpacing loss cost trend by the level that they
are. The rate increases throughout the year, by and large, are above and beyond what was anticipated.
Given the uncertainty around loss cost trend and specifically social inflation, WRB has deliberately decided
to take a wait-and-see attitude.
Q4 2021
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace
trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers
comp market, but one needs to be very cautious and most of the growth seen is really being driven by
payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive on WC pricing in addition to
leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this
stage, particularly in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any
current opportunities.
It's a good moment for the P&C space. Quite frankly, most of the workers' comp market, which
continues to feel a bit of a growing headwind. Obviously, property felt some pain in the quarter, but just
general market conditions are reasonably attractive. And we don't see that trend changing. More
We saw the firm market accelerate throughout 2019 and it continued to accelerate into 2020, very evident
in Q1. The evidence of this was demonstrated, at least in part by business leaving the standard market,
making its way to the specialty market and in particular, the E&S market, Rate increases were at a level not
Q2 2020 seen in some number of years and there was a reduction in capacity that various carriers were offering. All
of these things were being driven by two major factors: (1) low interest rate environment and a knock-on
effect for what that means for investment income; and (2) loss cost trends, driven to a great extent by
social inflation, which had been benign for an extended period of time and then crept up on the industry
when it was least expecting it and it has proven to be much more of an issue.
Q3 2021 specifically, it is a good moment for specialty writers, particularly casualty-related specialty writers and
even more so the E&S market. We continue to see a growing flow of opportunities, both in specialty and
even more so in E&S, and there's nothing that leads us to believe that, that tide is going to reverse
anytime soon. So that's definitely encouraging.
And as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines
with the exception of workers; compensation all of them continued to get rate increases that outpace
our view of loss trend. And that is even as we have been factoring in a bit more for financial inflation.
It's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as the rate increase and
what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior
Q2 2021
year. The simple fact is that when we think about our economic model it is multi-dimensional. We look
at the margins that are available in the business. And as we become pleased with the available margins
we start to think about possibly how we re-prioritize exposure of growth versus pushing further on rate.
01 2020 Rate increases that continue to progress in response to past conversations around social inflation and
keeping up with loss costs.
WRB described the current market environment as one that it has only seen two times previously, with
the prior two being the early 2000's hard market and the 1985-1986 hard market. The company
sounded very optimistic about its outlook and looks to take advantage of the hardening market
environment where some lines are seeing rate on rate compounding for just shy of three years, while
most lines are approaching rate adequacy. Further, the company called out seeing continued tailwinds in
the E&S market, driven by: (1) the standard market revisiting its appetite for the specialty market; (2)
expectations for increased audit premiums; and (3) new ventures. In addition to E&S tailwinds, WRB
indicated that most all lines are at or approaching rate adequacy with the exception of workers' comp.
Not all of the lines, however, are seeing the same increases and gave the example of professional
liability having seen rate increases for quite some time, while commercial auto has started to firm more
recently and workers' comp is in a soft market.
The challenges that the market faces has stemmed from a low interest rate environment, frequency of cat
activity, and social inflation has gotten to the point where it is no longer solely being talked about but it is
actually being acted upon. This is a meaningful sea change that became very visible in the Q4, and there is
Q4 2019 no sign of that slowing down. WRB said that they were excited about what was in front of us. They were
enthusiastic earlier in 2019, and the Q4 2019 built on that enthusiasm. Further WRB said that while there
are some that would suggest that they tend to be an optimistic organization, and that is a fair statement,
the data that they see in their business and the data the industry data supports this optimistic view.
June 2021 8
Non-Deal
Roadshow
(6/21/21)
Q1 2021
We are coming up for some of the major product lines on a third year in a row where we are getting
meaningful rate increases. And at this stage, we are seeing, as Rich suggested, rate on rate and in
many product lines where we have been getting rate on rate in excess of loss cost trend, again, we
think that is very encouraging for what that means for margin.
The fear factor is on the rise. If a low interest rate environment and consistent global cat activity over the
Q3 2019 past several years wasn't enough, it would seem as though social inflation is finally coming into focus for the
broader audience. People are beginning to realize that it is real and it is here. Frequency of severity can no
longer be ignored, both in the property space, but even more so in the casualty space.

Additional Thoughts On The Quarter
See below for an overview of additional thoughts on Q1 2022 earnings versus our estimates.
· Premium growth close to us and remained in the double digits. Gross written premium growth
of 15.1% was just below our 16.3% estimate and net written premium growth of 17.7% came
in above our 16.4% estimate (although did slow from +26.6% in Q4). By segment, insurance net
written premium growth of 19.2% beat our 18.2% estimate driven by growth in all lines (with
the strongest growth in other liability, short-tail lines, professional liability and commercial auto),
while reinsurance growth of 9.6% was above our 6.4% estimate driven by growth across the board.
Earned premium growth of 21.6% was just below our 22.0%.
. NII below us on alternatives. Net investment income of $173.5 million was below our $207.7
million estimate due to weaker alternative investment income (as we had assumed an elevated
return for all companies under our coverage given the strong S&P results in the Q4). Core portfolio
income of $112.3 million was above our $105.9 million estimate, while investment funds of $52.0
million was below our $91.4 million, arbitrage trading accounts of $9.2 million did fall modestly
below our $10.4 million estimate. The investment yield on the core portfolio was 2.14% was up
from 2.04% in Q4, 2.00% in the Q3 and 2.03% in the Q2.
· Other revenues above us. Revenues from non-insurance businesses was $97.8 million versus our
$95.0 million estimate, insurance service fees was $28.0 million above our $24.0 million estimate,
and other income of $0.8 million slightly beat our $0.5 million estimate.
. Combined ratio beat us on better expense ratio. The combined ratio of 87.8% beat our 88.2%
estimate due to a lower expense ratio. The insurance combined ratio was 87.6%, a beat versus our
88.4% estimate and the reinsurance combined ratio of 89.4% came in slightly above our 86.3%
estimate. The loss ratio was 59.5% versus our 59.6% estimate, while the expense ratio of 28.3%
beat our 28.5% estimate and WRB alluded to continued leverage on the expense side as earned
premium continues to grow. Catastrophe losses of $28.8 million (1.3 points) were just above our
$27.2 million (1.2 point) estimate. WRB did not call out any Covid-19 losses this quarter.
· Underlying results beat us mostly on better expense ratio. The underlying combined ratio
was 86.5% versus our 86.9% estimate, due to a stronger-than-forecasted expense ratio, while
the underlying loss ratio of 58.3% was just better than our 58.4% estimate, and improved by 60
basis points from last Q1. The insurance underlying combined ratio of 87.1% in Q1, was better
than our 87.3% estimate driven by a better expense ratio with the insurance underlying loss ratio
coming in at 59.0% in line with our estimate. The reinsurance underlying combined ratio came in at
83.1%, better than our 84.3% estimate driven by a better loss and expense ratio. The reinsurance
underlying loss ratio was 53.6%, better than our 54.3% estimate. In getting the segment underlying
loss ratios we attribute all the favorable reserve development to the insurance segment (WRB
provides the breakout of its reserve development in its 10Q/10K).
· Capital return below us given lack of buyback. WRB did not repurchase shares during the quarter,
versus our 0.8 million shares for $50 million estimate, the $0 million in Q4, and the $93 million that
was repurchased in the Q3. Including dividends (regular and special), total capital return was $23.0
million, or 7.5% of operating earnings of $306.9 million.

Summary Of Estimate Changes
Estimates Move Higher on Better Investment Income. See Exhibit 4 below for an overview of our
estimate changes following Q1 2022 earnings. Post WRB's conference call we are raising our 2022
EPS estimate to $4.00 from $3.90 while our 2023 EPS estimate goes to $4.70 from $4.40, and our
2024 EPS estimate goes to $5.50 from $5.00 primarily reflecting higher investment income (as the
new money rate is now 100 basis points above the portfolio yield). In general, we view this as a bullish
quarter and call from WRB as they: (1) pointed to the still healthy market conditions, including the
E&S market remains attractive, (2) leverage they continue to see on the expense side, and (3) their
conservatism as they said they are seeing hundreds of basis points from earned rate exceeding loss
trend, but only booked about 60 basis points in the quarter.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases
in 2022 which should translate into underlying margin improvement, and we do not believe this is currently reflected in consensus
expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $80.00 from $76.00
Our price target of $80 is based on a 2.4x multiple of our year-end 2023 book value estimate. Our price target also represents a ~17.0x
multiple against our 2023 EPS estimate. The 17x is a premium to the standard commercial players given that WRB is showing better
growth. Further, it is a discount to its peak historical multiples, further supporting the choice of multiple in our view.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe and/or Covid-19 losses.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
