Mar. '22 Earnings: Lifting the Mirage
We think headline pricing approvals in select states and a less
severe CPI indicator (used car sales) can only go so far to turn
around results. AYLR deterioration is disappointing. Bottom
line, auto pricing remains inadequate relative to loss trend, we
anticipate a long journey ahead for auto insurers.

PGR's underlying loss ratio of 74.2% in March deteriorated from 74.1% in February. We were
anticipating deterioration m/m, yet PGR came in slightly better than our estimated 74.5%. Over
the last 17 years, only Feb 2015 had worse AYLR results than Feb-March 2022. Moreover, agency
business tends to perform better than direct, we saw a reversal of trend this month (agency LR
of 77.5% > direct LR of 77.2%). We think the preceding months saw a boost from Omicron. We
also started to see a large influx of return to office starting in March, increasing frequency.
PIF growth slowdown: PGR's total personal auto PIF y/y growth slowed (+0.6%, slightly better
than our estimate of -1.0%) driven by a slowdown in auto direct (+2.2% vs. our +0.3%) and auto
agency (-1.3% vs. our -2.5%). We were probably a month too early estimating negative PIF auto
growth, but we have high conviction that is imminent. PGR is taking multiple bites of the apple
in its rate request journey. We include in this note our analysis of PGR's approved and
pending rate filings. PGR is making progress in its rate filings journey, yet we have not seen
nationwide momentum. We think some state regulators question if miles driven will ever return
to pre-pandemic levels. Other states (particularly catastrophe prone) may want to put a lid on
overall consumer costs when considering higher homeowners' premiums and utility costs, in
our view.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving business
mix, which could lower ROEs. Likewise,
we struggle to see how PGR could
return to its historical PIF growth rate,
as the company cut rates early during
the pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 125.00
If PGR is able to achieve personal auto
rate adequacy and return to historical
PIF growth rates. If PGR leverages its
multivariate pricing model across
newer business lines. Upside case
reflects ~25x '23E EPS.
Downside case
USD 75.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with greater
rate catch up. Downside case reflects
~15x '23E EPS.

Looking at March renewal effective dates, PGR received 35 rate approvals in 11 states: AK, CT,
IA, KY, LA, NM, OR, PA, RI, VA, and WI, ranging from 0% to ~16%. PGR's rate approvals show a
weighted average of +6.2% approvals on ~$3.2bn of subject premiums, or ~$199mn in
additional premiums, which in our view does not move the needle that much.
Last year, PGR swiftly graduated from rebates to rate decreases well ahead of the industry. This
implies that PGR has to catch up more than other industry participants on the rate side to get to
a better baseline pricing spot.
Rate Approvals April - June '22 (based on renewal effective dates):
So far the total ask is +5.3% on subject premiums across just 19 states, not nationwide: AL, AR,
AZ, DE, GA, ID, IL, KS, LA, MN, MS, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, SC. PGR's upcoming rate increases
show a weighted average of 5.3% approvals on ~$9.2bn of subject premiums, or ~$492mn in
additional premiums.
Pending Rate Requests: So far the total ask is +10.5% (weighted average) on subject
premiums
PGR has submitted 72 pending rate changes for renewal effective dates: April '21 (meaning still
in limbo for 12 months) through April '22 in just 10 states, not nationwide: DC, FL, GA, HI, MD,
NJ, OR, RI, TN, TX. PGR's pending rate increases show a weighted average of 10.5% rate
requests on ~$6.4bn of subject premiums, or ~$673mn in additional premiums. We do not think
pending filings is enough to make a significant impact considering the scope of PGR's total
personal auto written premiums. To put that in context, PGR reported ~$36.2bn of personal
auto premiums in 2021, therefore pending rate requests represent about 2% of its total
premiums.
PIF Growth Spotlight
PIF growth y/y trend continued to moderate in March
PGR's total personal auto PIF y/y growth slowed (+0.6%, slightly better than our estimate of -
1.0%) driven by a slowdown in auto direct (+2.2% vs. our +0.3%) and auto agency (-1.3% vs. our

high conviction that is imminent.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related

M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC

Valuation Methodology: Our $88 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.9x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2023E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
