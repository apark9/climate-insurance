May '21: Summer Glimpse
Stock Rating
UNDERWEIGHT
Unchanged
Industry View
POSITIVE
Frequency normalizing and summer road trips should worsen trends: PGR's reported
monthly underlying combined ratios (Figure 1) continue on an upward trend (81.5%
Jan, 88.9% Feb, 88.7% March, 90.0% April, and 91.2% May). We think summer months
will increase miles driven contributing to worsening frequency trends. This is on the
back of potentially higher auto physical damage in light of higher used car
sales/rentals.
NWP growth comparison to last year is a noisy benchmark: Net written premium was
meaningfully lower for both auto direct (1.1% versus our 11.2% estimate) and auto
agency (0.7% vs. our 8.0% estimate) than historical levels. PGR mentioned that NPW
growth in personal lines would have been 5-7 points higher in light of last year's
countrywide moratoriums and benign policy cancellations. PGR's policies in force (PIF)
growth was in line with our expectations on both auto direct (+13%) and auto agency
(+9%) see figure 6. We were surprised that PGR filed rate cuts in June (based on
weighted average filing change - see figure 7). We think there is a possibility that auto
insurers may have to raise rates in response to worsening loss trend. In hindsight, it
appears PGR and others may have taken rate cuts taken too soon in a fluid loss trend
environment.
EPS in line with our expectations: Operating EPS of $0.38 was in line with our $0.38.
Cats were better than our expectation (1.8 pts vs. our 2.9 pts estimate). The underlying
loss ratio was 71.3%, which was worse than our 68.4% estimate, though PGR's
expense ratio of 19.8% was better than our 21% forecast.

Unchanged
We maintain our price target at $86 and Underweight rating. Our PT is based on a
50/50 weighting of 16.5x '22E $5.08 EPS and ~2.7x '22E book value ex AOCI per share
of $32.81. We reduced our EPS estimates for 2021, from $5.53 to $5.11, to reflect
worsening underlying loss ratio for the personal auto business. We expect underwriting
to normalize to pre-COVID-19 levels quicker than we had originally anticipated. We are
modestly lowering our operating EPS for 2022 from $5.11 to $5.08 for 2022.

Industry View: POSITIVE
Stock Rating: UNDERWEIGHT
Price (16-Jun-2021)
USD 92.92
Price Target
USD 86.00
Why Underweight? Our call on PGR takes a longer
term view. PGR may need to hold more capital to
support an evolving business mix, which could lower
ROEs. We see PGR's business expansion beyond core
personal auto focus to be more defensive vs.
offensive. PGR's excess growth in commercial auto
runs against the industry grain and expands risk
appetite to riskier auto classes.
Upside case
USD 102.00
If PGR is able to leverage its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines, it could achieve
the same measurable success as its core personal
auto book. Our upside case of $102 assumes ~20x
P/E multiple on our '22 EPS estimate.
Downside case
USD 75.00
We think margins peak in 2020 and are not reflective
of longer term trends. Auto pricing reflects artificially
low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic. Our
downside case of $75 assumes a ~15x P/E multiple
on our '22 EPS estimate.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage
universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life

Chubb Limited (CB)

Valuation Methodology: Our $86 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted 16.5x P/E multiple on our '22 EPS estimate of $5.08 and 2.7x P/BV
excluding AOCI on our '22 BVPS ex. AOCI of $32.81.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR were
to meet its 96% combined ratio objective in newer business lines driving the recent expansion of its core business profile by leveraging its
multivariate pricing model. In addition, we think margins are peaking in 2020 due to environmental factors and not reflective of longer-term
trends but if PGR is able to avoid margin pressure over the long term it could maintain a stronger earnings growth profile than anticipated. While
auto pricing currently reflects artificially low frequency trends brought on by a pandemic, a reversion to more normal pricing points should prove
difficult to achieve. However, normalization of pricing could drive better performance in personal auto.
