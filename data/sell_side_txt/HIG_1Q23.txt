1Q23 Earnings Review: Public D&O &
WC headwinds are manageable
Public D&O premiums are marginal at $200mn. WC headwinds
were already built into HIG's 2023 outlook. HIG is taking a more
cautious posture with respect to any green shoots in tougher
states like CA and building in more conservative severity loss
trend assumptions.

Small Commercial Growth Spotlight: Despite some margin compression within Small
Commercial (2 pts q/q, 3.6 pts y/y) from WC, we like seeing HIG grow this segment. On an
absolute basis, a 89.5% underlying CR is still impressive and is better than its business
segments. HIG is constructive that small commercial can exceed $5bn of annual premiums in
the near term vs. $4.6bn in FY22 thanks to new business and E&S momentum. Spectrum, its
Business Owner's Product, is taking off. In a downturn scenario, having scale matters. There is
plenty of headroom where at $5bn of PF premiums we estimate HIG would only have 3-4%
market share.
We think 1Q23 results put HIG on track to meet many of its 2023 financial targets with the
exception of Personal Lines Underlying Combined Ratio and Core ROE clouded by headwinds in
Personal Auto.

1Q23 results on track to meet many FY2023 targets. While we only have one quarter of data,
we think HIG will meet many of its 2023 outlook guideposts with the exception of personal lines
combined ratio and core ROE. First, on personal lines: HIG's personal lines underlying
combined ratio was 97.0% in 1Q23 vs. 88.5% in 1Q22 and above management's target range of
93%-95% in 2023 (shared in Feb.), driven by unprofitable auto lines. The auto underlying
combined ratio was 105.1% despite 1Q typically being a better quarter on a seasonal basis.
Management noted that they are facing more headwinds in auto underlying combined ratio
than expected last quarter. If the inflation and severity pressure observed in 1Q23 continues into
2Q and 3Q 2023 and starts to revert in Q423, the auto loss ratio would be 4 to 6 pts higher than
management's target for the full year. On commercial lines, management remains confident in
the 87%-89% underlying combined ratio guidance in 2023 and believes it can beat the 88.3%
reported in 2022 due to (1) higher rate premiums earning in; (2) business mix shift, notably more
property; and (3) underwriting / risk selection initiatives across all businesses that will improve
margins.

Standard lines pricing (ex. Global Specialty) and ex WC basis was up 8.1% in 1Q23 from 7.9% in
4Q22. Public D&O rates dropped 20% in the quarter, accordingly Global Specialty pricing fell
sequentially (3.7% in 1Q23 vs. 4.2% in 4Q22.) Public D&O is a $200mn GPW business for HIG.
To recap, HIG shared last quarter its expectations of 1 pt of improvement within its Commercial
underlying combined ratio (ex WC) in '23. Commercial lines ex public D&O and ex WC, pricing
was 7.7% in 1Q23 well in excess of loss cost trend. This compares to 6.8% commercial lines ex
WC pricing in 1Q23. About a 100bps spread. Therefore, excluding both WC and D&O, HIG is
expecting its underlying combined ratio to improve by 200 bps y/y.
Personal lines posts robust rate increases. Auto written price increases were 10.0% (up from
6.2% last quarter) and HIG received an 18.3% rate approval in applicable states (up from 8.3%
last quarter). Management aims to increase pricing to mid-teens by 2Q23. Homeowners
written price increases were 13.9% in 1Q23 (up from 13.3% last quarter). That said, these rates
will take time to earn in. Policies in Force (PIF) were slightly down for both lines of business this
quarter. While new premiums were strong (auto +12% q/q and homeowners +17% q/q),
retention of existing customers in homeowners was flat due to price increases. We view this
decline positively as it means HIG is not actively growing auto, a loss leading LOB.
Net Investment Income (NII). HIG reported $515mn of NII in the quarter (down 19.5% q/q and
up 1.2% y/y). The yields on the portfolio were slightly better than management's Q1
expectations: (1) annualized investment yield ex. LLP (pre-tax) of 3.8% vs. 3.7% last quarter and
2023 guide of 3.75% at mid-point; and (2) annualized LP Returns (pre-tax) of 2.5% vs. 16.8% last
quarter and vs. 2023 guide of 4-6%. Management expects the Q2 return to land at a similar level.
Peer Leading P&C ROE: HIG's core ROE of 14.3% is at the low end of management's 14%-15%
guidance for 2023. Broken down by segment, core ROE was 15.5% for P&C, 13.6% for group
benefits, and 42.8% for Hartford Funds. Note, HIG excludes AOCI from the denominator of its
CORE ROE.

Why OVERWEIGHT?
HIG has sound fundamentals
following transformation, which
should continue to drive a stronger
book multiple. ROE convergence
with peers should make current
valuation look inexpensive.
Navigators acquisition is becoming
more accretive given boost from
hard pricing in specialty lines. HIG
has accelerated the pace of its
expense savings plans.
Upside case
USD 95.00
Our upside case reflects stronger
than expected underwriting margin
expansion and commercial P&C
pricing levels and improving group
benefits margins. Our upside case is
~1.5x '24 BVPS ex AOCI.
Downside case
USD 65.00
Our downside case assumes
unsuccessful underwriting margin
expansion and expense savings as
well as a slowdown in the
commercial P&C renewal rate
environment and recessionary
pressures. Our downside case is
~6.8x '24E EPS.

1Q23 vs. Target Financial Plan
Although we are only one quarter into the year, we track 1Q23 progression against full-year
2023 guidance:
Â· HIG's personal lines underlying CR of 97.0% in 1Q23 was above management's target range
of 93%-95% in 2023. Management implied a higher guide for underlying combined ratio in
FY2023 than what it shared in February with the auto loss ratio potentially rising 4 to 6 pts
higher than management's target for the full year is inflation does not abate from 1Q23.
. Commercial lines underlying CR of 88.5% in 1Q23 was at the high end of the 2023 guide of
87%-89%.
. Group Benefits core earnings margin for 1Q23 came in at 5.2%, below the company's 6%-7%
target range for 2023.
Â· P&C CAY cat ratio of 5.3% vs. management's target of 4.2% in 2023.
. Core ROE of 14.3% vs. management's 14-15% target for 2023. We forecast 13.5% for 2023
and 15.5% for 2024.

Personal Lines - Rates, Underlying Margins, and PIF
Auto rates. As discussed with 4Q23 results, HIG expects to accelerate auto renewal written
pricing to the mid-teens by 2Q23 and stabilize thereafter for the rest of the year. The company
projects they will be price adequate by mid-year and sees loss cost trends remaining elevated in
1H23 and then decreasing to normalized levels in 2H23. In 1Q23, auto written price increases
were 10.0% (up from 6.2% last quarter) and the company achieved an 18.3% rate approval in
applicable states (up from 8.3% last quarter). We believe both written rates and approved rates
will take time to earn in, especially considering that the bulk of HIG's policies are 12 months
(though more recent marketing efforts for Prevail are centered on 6-month policies).
Auto underlying combined ratio of 105.1% was down 3.8 pts sequentially but up 11.8 pts y/y.
Typically 1Q is a seasonally better quarter for auto yet underlying results remain unprofitable.

Barclays | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
HIG saw continued auto liability and physical damage severity, partially offset by higher pricing
earning through and a lower expense ratio.
Homeowners rates. Homeowners earned pricing is expected to track closely to loss cost trends
throughout 2023. HIG continues to push for rate with a 13.9% written rate increase in 1Q23 (up
from 13.3% last quarter).
Homeowners underlying combined ratio of 78.9% was up 10.6 pts sequentially and up 1.5 pts
y/y due to higher weather related frequency and severity and non-weather related severity (e.g.,
higher rebuilding costs). This was somewhat offset by higher rates earning through and a lower
expense ratio.
The loss ratio for Personal Lines increased to 79.6% in 1Q23 compared to 74.4% in 4Q22 and
62.8% in 1Q22.
Policies in Force (PIF) slightly down. PIF declined 1.4% q/q for Auto (vs. down 0.6% q/q last
quarter) and 1.2% for Homeowners (down 1.2% q/q last quarter). While new premiums were
strong (auto +12% q/q and homeowners +17% q/q), retention of existing customers was flat for
homeowners due to price increases. We view this PIF decline in auto positively as it means HIG
is not actively growing a loss leading LOB.

Commercial Lines - Spotlight on Small Commercial,
Rates and Underlying Margins
Spotlight on Small Commercial. Management believes Small Commercial is on track to exceed
$5 bn in annual written premiums in the near term (1Q23 print annualized implies $5.3 bn). In
addition, having doubled its E&S premium, HIG is focused on maintaining the E&S growth
momentum which has opened up an incremental $7.5 bn of addressable market.
Commercial Lines pricing ex workers' compensation (WC) is re-accelerating slightly to 6.8% in
1Q23 from 6.6% in 4Q22. Looking at Standard Lines (i.e., ex. Global Specialty) and ex WC, pricing
was up 8.1%.
Workers Compensation pricing: WC pricing remained positive due to higher than expected
average wage growth (an exposure than acts like rate). On the rate side, peer WRB mentioned
that California WC is showing potential signs of firming, which is ahead of the rest of the market.
When asked if HIG was observing the same signs, management said they are "a little more
sanguine and cautious" and that they are watching for "green shoots" in CA and other states
closely. On the loss trend side, HIG reiterated 5% severity which they think is more conservative
than peers. HIG would not quantify loss trends on the frequency side, but it characterized it as
an improvement and negative.

Commercial Lines underlying margin deteriorated by 0.2 pts y/y and 1.1 pts q/q to 88.5%. HIG
is targeting commercial lines underlying combined ratio of 87%-89% in 2023. Broken down by
segment:
Â· Middle & Large Commercial underlying combined ratio of 89.9% in 1Q23 improved from
90.2% in 4Q22.
. Small Commercial underlying combined ratio at 89.5% in 1Q23 deteriorated from 87.5% in
4Q22.
Â· Global Specialty underlying combined ratio of 85.2% in 1Q23 deteriorated from 83.0% in
4Q22.
Group Benefits
Core earnings margin of 5.2% in 1Q23 was worse than our estimate of 6.3% and below the full-
year 2023 guidance of 6%-7%. 1Q is typically worse for core margins on a seasonal standpoint.
Group Benefits loss ratio improved to 75.2% from 82.0% y/y, driven by lower mortality followed
by favorable long-term disability incidence. Recall, HIG expects excess mortality losses to
improve y/y in 2023 yet stabilize above pre-pandemic levels, and is pricing accordingly.
Forward-Looking Commentary/Model Updates
. Net Investment Income (NII). As discussed with Q422 results, HIG anticipates (1)
annualized investment yield ex. LLP (pre-tax) of 3.75% at mid-point in FY2023 (up 50-60 bps
from FY2022); and (2) annualized LP returns of 4%-6% in FY2023. Management expects the
2Q23 LP return to land at a similar level to 1Q23 at 2.5%. We increased our estimates for
commercial premium growth, in turn we are estimating higher net invested assets and

is inflation does not abate from 1Q23. We model a more conservative 98.1% in FY2023.
Â· Capital Returns: During 1Q23 HIG repurchased $350mn of shares (in line with our $350mn
estimate). HIG has $2.4bn remaining on its board authorized buyback programs through
YE24. We are modeling a $345mn quarterly buyback run-rate.
. CRE. HIG has $6 bn of commercial mortgage loans with 9.6% in office. Management is
confident that 2023 and 2024 CRE maturities are manageable.
We reiterate our Overweight rating on HIG. Our $87 price target on HIG is based on a 50/50
weighted 9.5x (unchanged) $9.54 '24E EPS (was $9.34) and 1.27x (was 1.3x) 2024E book value
per share ex AOCI of $65.10 (was $65.47).
1Q23 Variance
Core EPS. HIG reported 1Q23 core earnings per diluted share of $1.68, up 1% y/y, which it had
pre-announced on April 13 (see our April 14 note Model Update: 1Q23 Preliminary Results).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our $87 price target on HIG is based on a 50/50 weighted 9.5x '24E EPS and 1.27x 2024E book value per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Risks to HIG reaching our PT include greater
exposure to a reduction in policies in force from business closures/affordability issues (beyond a drop in insurable losses as work forces partially
migrate remotely going forward). If unexpected adverse reserve development (e.g. exhaustion of HIG's ADCs) could also materialize.
