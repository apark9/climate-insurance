Jan '23 Earnings: Unfavorable PYD
While unfavorable PYD in January is seasonal to some degree,
the level taken is higher than typical. Sequential PIF growth
feels less sustainable given capital constraints.

Unfavorable PYD: It appears every January PGR takes a reserve charge since any changes in
prior month re-estimates is accounted for in prior AYs rather than the CY given it is the first
month of the year. Even so, the company's 6.5 pts of unfavorable PYD is higher than the 2.6 pt
average run rate (from Jan '22-Jan '18). The majority (75%) of the $330mn of unfavorable PYD
related to an uptick in December case reserves for personal auto property damage, collision,
and comprehensive coverages given higher settlements and changes to re-estimates including
inflationary factors. The balance of adverse PYD came from commercial auto (20%) and
property.

Potential Upside/Downside
-11.7%
We note, PGR's reported combined ratio in January was exactly at its 96% target, a factor that
may have played into PGR's thinking on the ultimate amount of adverse PYD it was willing to
take in the month.
The cost & sustainability of growth: Personal auto PIF grew +2.4% sequentially (Jan '23 vs.
Dec '22), up from +0.4% sequentially (Dec. vs. Nov.). On an annualized basis, that would imply
PIF growth of 29% vs. 5% (keeping monthly growth constant over 12 months), though there are
seasonality adjustments needed. We question the sustainability of growth, as PGR's premiums
to surplus is near 3x. On a y/y basis, PGR recognized positive personal auto PIF growth over the
last four months (+5.4% in Jan, +2.6% in Dec, +1.7% in Nov and +0.5% in Oct '22). PGR's pricing
may appear more competitive as the insurer believes taking rates is behind it, a sentiment that
we think is premature. PGR may be leaving rate on the table.

Favorable seasonality in January contributed to PGR's improved underlying loss ratio of 68.5%
in Jan from 75.4% in Dec and 75.7% in Nov. PGR's expense ratio rose to a much more normal
20.2% in Jan from 17.3% in Dec and 18.0% in Nov. To recap, PGR's pre-pandemic expense ratio
ran just north of 20%. We previously mentioned that an expense ratio well below 20% was not
sustainable. However, a higher expense ratio in Jan is not coming from a higher policy
acquisition ratio that is remaining steady, rather from higher other underwriting expenses.
PGR's underlying loss ratio three-month simple average of 73.2% has a way to go to return to
pre-pandemic levels (~68%). We think auto insurers will approach rate adequacy in 2024 - to be
sure, not a return to 2019 levels.

commercial premium growth was down (5.8)% in Jan '23, on an adjusted basis down (1%). We
estimated a (3)% reduction in Commercial NPW.
PGR continues to see more NII gains, as the duration of its assets is shorter, leading to a quicker
turnover rate, and its total investments to shareholder equity is high at 3.3x. On a capital
adequacy standpoint, while auto is a less capital-intensive business than other lines, we think
PGR's high asset leverage may pressure an already constrained capital position. PGR's premium
growth levels (+16% NPW y/y) consume capital and it is generating lower organic capital
through earnings than its historical trend. PGR's pre-tax net investment income (ex expenses)
this month was $131mn vs. our $128mn estimate. Higher equity market returns (6.4% common
stock yield) boosted NII in the quarter.
January operating EPS of $0.43 missed our $0.62 estimate, reflecting adverse PYD and a higher
expense ratio. We had modeled catastrophe loss of $63mn vs. PGR's $40.3mn.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 152.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~21x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 90.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~13x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +5.4% in January (well above our estimate of
+3.2%), as auto agency PIF (+0.9% vs. our -0.6%) was augmented by growth in auto direct
(+9.2% vs. our 6.3%). We note, this is the first time auto agency PIF was in positive territory since
February '22.

Underlying loss ratio - Favorable Seasonality
Favorable seasonality in January contributed to PGR's improved underlying loss ratio of 68.5%
in Jan from 75.4% in Dec and 75.7% in Nov. PGR's expense ratio rose to a much more normal
20.2% in Jan from 17.3% in Dec and 18.0% in Nov. Collectively, PGR's underlying combined ratio
of 88.7% has improved from 92.7% in Dec, 93.7% in Nov, and 95.9% in Oct.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
Our focus is on an absolute basis, where used car pricing remains significantly elevated (see
Figure 3). Likewise, if we compare used car & truck pricing to Jan '19 levels, it is up 34.7% vs. all
items at 18.9%. We pay lesser attention to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban
Consumers, which rose 6.4% over the 12 months from Jan 2022 to Jan 2023. Used car and truck
CPI trails all items at -11.6% in Jan vs. - 8.8% in Dec.

Manheim pricing was +1.5% m/m. We put less weight on Manheim pricing -13.7% y/y basis.
More importantly, if we compare Jan '22 to Jan '20, Manheim pricing is still up 44%.
Compounded auto pricing during that period has not caught up - not anywhere close. There is
still significant rate catch-up needed to see that inflection point. It will be like an "x"; loss costs
go down, then pricing goes up - where the two intersect in our view can take a bit longer,
especially given how long it is taking auto pricing to actually "earn" in.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC

Valuation Methodology: Our $123 PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
