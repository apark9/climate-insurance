Dec '21 Earnings: Long Grind
Even though PGR is once again showing a combined ratio
below its target, we think getting back to rate adequacy and
double-digit PIF growth will be a long grind.

December results show that PGR's underwriting results are again below its 96% target (with
94.6% reported), though we recognize that the company had to sacrifice meaningful PIF growth
to get there (see Figure 2). Just like last month, PGR once again recognized favorable
development from Ida losses (0.4 pts on the combined ratio). While Ida favorable development
was on auto business opposed to homeowners, we still think it may be premature to take such
actions.
PGR's underlying loss ratio of 75.4% was worse than our expected 74.4% as we expected a
frequency benefit from Omicron. Just like we said post Nov. '21 results, we do not think a month
or two is an indicative trend and still side with more caution.
We anticipate a long grind for PGR to get back to rate adequacy and double-digit PIF
growth. PGR plans to take multiple bites of the apple in its rate request journey. That approach
could aggravate rate adequacy. In the meantime, we will see accumulation of loss trend with
severity on the rise and more rate catch-up needs. We include in this note our analysis of
PGR's approved and pending rate filings. We think it can take until late 2023 for auto
insurance pricing to be rational, even though most policies are 6 months.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving business
mix, which could lower ROEs. Likewise,
we struggle to see how PGR could
return to its historical PIF growth rate,
as the company cut rates early during
the pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 120.00
If PGR is able to achieve personal auto
rate adequacy and return to historical
PIF growth rates. If PGR leverages its
multivariate pricing model across
newer business lines. Upside case
reflects ~29x '22E EPS and ~23x '23E
EPS.
Downside case
USD 75.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with greater
rate catch up. Downside case reflects
~18x '22E EPS and ~14x '23E EPS.

Looking at December renewal effective dates, PGR received 2 rate approvals only in AZ ranging
from 3.5% to 6.9%. January appears to serve more of a catch up with 25 rate approvals received
in: VA, TN, PA, MS, NC, KS. AR. ME. SC and AL ranging from 0%-11.7% (latter in TN, all other
states are single digits).
Last year, PGR swiftly graduated from rebates to rate decreases well ahead of the industry. This
implies that PGR has to catch up more than other industry participants on the rate side to get to
a better baseline pricing spot.
Pending Filings: So far the total ask is +2.3% on subject premiums
PGR has submitted pending rate increases through renewal effective dates May '22 in just 11
states, not nationwide: CT, DC, FL, GA, HI, ID, MD, MI, NV, OR, and TX.
PIF Growth Spotlight
PIF growth y/y trend continued to fall in December across agent (+3.4%)
and direct (+7.7%).
PGR reported -0.4% m/m decline in auto PIF growth (in line with our modeled -0.4%).

Underlying Combined Ratio Improving Sequentially
Though we would like to see greater improvements within auto (total auto loss ratio ex
catastrophes improved 30 bps m/m). We think PGR's property loss ratio (ex cats) of 48% is not
sustainable though it has kept up near this level in the last few months. Part of PGR's combined
ratio improvement story is on the expense ratio side. Lower advertising is a lever PGR can pull

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Barclays | Progressive Corp.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $83 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.7x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2022E/2023E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
