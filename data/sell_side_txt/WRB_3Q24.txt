Price Target Change - October 21, 2024
Commercial Lines Insurance
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
October Growth Less Scary; Q3 Earnings and Conference Call Roundup
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
WRB posted in-line EPS even with $0.05 from FX. Premium growth was light (but
improved in October) with underlying margin beating expectations and modest $1m of
PYD (from insurance). Pricing moved up 10bps sequentially to 8.4% ex workers' comp.
Estimate and price target changes: Our 2024 EPS estimate goes to $4.00 (from $4.03)
as we up the Q4 cat load to 2.7 pts (from 2.1 pts) as we assume $44m of Milton losses
(Helene was about half of Q3 cats, $97.8m). Our 2025 and 2026 estimates go to $4.40
and $4.80 (from $4.25 and $4.65) reflecting modestly better underlying loss ratios, a
lower FY cat load and higher fixed NII. Our price target is $68 (from $63) based on 15.4x
our 2025 EPS estimate / 2.6x our estimated 2025 book value of ~$26.
Takes for the group: (1) pricing improved: pricing ex comp ticked up modestly and
Berkley was positive on underlying conditions in E&S market, (2) rate exceeded loss
trend: WRB said rate remains in excess of trend and underlying margin improvement
should continue, (3) reinsurance color: reinsurance rates could come under pressure at
1/1 if Milton losses don't worsen, and (4) no movement in reserves: there was $1m of
releases as releases in insurance offset modest strengthening in reinsurance.
Premium growth and current AY discussion: Premium growth was 7%, below our 10.5%
and 11.1% in Q2 and the 10-15% it targets (on an annual basis) with WRB attributing
the slowdown to commercial auto, which has improved in October. Berkley has said that
premium growth can bounce around by quarter but annually should be in 10-15% range.
Overall WRB believes rate increases are keeping up and perhaps exceeding trend, and they
expect their underlying margin to continue to improve.
Investment income: Investment income should grow, when adjusting for outsized
investment income from Argentina in H1 2024. Argentinian inflation-securities should be
stable going forward. WRB sees an opportunity to nudge out duration (from 2.4 years)
as yield curve takes on a more traditional shape. As a result they do not expect to give up
much on new money rates (currently above 5%). Additional NII guide was for investment
funds to generate income of $10m/qtr in short-term and pick-up to $20m.
Other conference call highlights: New units should help both premiums earned and the
expense ratio as they ramp up. New initiatives added about $25m of premium in Q3 and
should grow from here. Also helping premium they were positive on flow to the non-
admitted market. Tax rate should be high end of 23-24% in Q4 and 23.5-24% in 2025 as
international makes up larger piece of business. See inside for highlights of key issues for
WRB. We also hosted a lunch last week in Boston (see our note here).

Base Case | $68.00
. Our price target of $68 is based on just
around 2.6x our 2025 estimated book.
· Our price target also represents a
~15.4x multiple against our 2025 EPS
estimate.
· The 14.8x is a slight discount to where
WRB has historically traded as we
look to be conservative given social
inflation impacting both current and
prior accident years.
Upside Scenario | $78.00
· Our $78 upside price target assumes a
multiple of 3.0x 2025 book value, close
to peak valuation levels.
. We assume WRB is able to see
consistent double-digit premium
growth (at the high end of 10-15% or
above), margin expansion and good
investment returns resulting in industry
leading returns.
· Assumes lack of significant adverse
reserve development.
Downside Scenario | $52.00
. Our $52 downside price target assumes
a multiple of 2.0x our estimated
2025 book value (11.8x P/E) and is
below trough levels (although those
multiples were in lower interest rate
environments).
·
In this scenario WRB could see lower
premium growth (below the expected
10-15%), margin compression and
investments volatility.
· The downside scenario includes adverse
development on the softer market
years / more recent accident years.
Upcoming Catalysts
· Monthly pricing surveys, which will highlight the overall
strength (or lack thereof) of the commercial lines pricing
environment
. The filing of its 10Q, which should provide more color on the
reserve movement within the insurance segment in Q3

Q3 Earnings Highlights
In a Nutshell. WRB reported Q3 EPS of $0.93, in-line with our $0.93 and just above consensus
of $0.92 even with a $0.05 hit from FX (we did not include FX in our estimate). Cat losses came
in at $97.8m (3.3 pts), modestly higher than our $85.0m (2.9 pts). Prior year favorable reserve
development was $1 million, relative to estimate for $3m of adverse development (0.1 pts) with $3m
of favorable development in insurance offset by $2m of adverse development within reinsurance. The
investment income was fairly in line with us ($323.8m vs our $324.3m) as higher core portfolio income
of $301.1m vs our $297.7m offset a lower investment funds income of $4.7m (1.2% return) vs our
estimate of $8.0m (2.0% return).
The underlying combined ratio of 87.6% was better than our 88.2%; the underlying loss ratio came in
40bps better than us and was 60 basis points better than the prior year quarter. The expense ratio was
28.5%, 20 basis points lower than us. WRB bought back $12.5m of shares, relative to our $50m, and
returned an additional $125.8m through dividends (included a special dividend) for a payout ratio of
37%. The average diluted share count of 401.8m was modestly higher than our 401.5m estimate. The
operating ROE was 20.0%, and the net income ROE was 19.6%. Book value per share grew by 8.2%
sequentially to $22.11.

What the Companies Are Saying - WRB
Outlook
Overall, WRB believes rate increases are keeping up and perhaps exceeding trend, and they expect
their underlying margin to continue to improve. WRB expects that the yield curve will take more of a
traditional shape, which should create an opportunity for them to nudge out their duration and their
book yield to pick up. As a result, they do not expect they will have to give up much on new money rate
(currently just north of 5% but below 5.25%) as they nudge out duration.
WRB sees opportunity emerging in the non-admitted market as we deal with climate change
and social inflation. Additionally, on the regulatory front regulators are struggling from a staffing
perspective which is also driving more business to the specialty, and in particular the E&S market.
Lastly, there are some new initiatives that should help both the expense ratio and earned premium as
they ramp up (around $25+ million of premiums moved to segments in the quarter, and they are in the
early stages of scaling).
Pricing
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8.4% in Q3, 10 bps higher than 8.3% in Q2 with auto
leading the way followed by excess and umbrella. On the reinsurance side, if Milton does not prove to
be uglier WRB would expect it to be hard for reinsurers to see flat pricing at 1/1. Hurricane Helene hit
areas where cats are not supposed to happen and individuals are taking a step back and analyzing what
this means for exposure.
Guidance
On the guidance side, they remained confident in achieve premium growth between 10 and 15%,
although they did caveat some quarters may be below or above the range with the shortfall in the Q3
being attributed to commercial auto (and lines such as umbrella/excess that auto touches), which has
improved in October. Away from premium growth guidance included: (1) the expense ratio should be
comfortably below 30%, (2) Argentine inflation-linked securities should provide normalized levels of
income going forward as the Q3 2024 income from these securities was comparable with the prior
year quarter, although the level was not quantified (our sense is around $20-30m which was part
of their original guide), (3) investment funds should add around $10 million a quarter, (4) The Q4
tax rate should fall at the high-end of the 23-24% range as the tax rate has moved higher due to a
higher contribution from foreign earnings. The FY 2025 rate should be close to the 2024 rate (in the
23.5-24.0% range) but they are looking at ways to keep the rate down as much as they can, and (5)
They said it was premature to give a loss estimate for Hurricane Milton and the outcome would be
within what would be expected from the company.
Investments
Net investment income was $323.8m in Q3, below $330m in Q2 but close to our $324.3m estimate
as income from the Argentinian-linked securities slowed in the quarter. The duration of the portfolio
was 2.4 years, down modestly when compared to 2.5 years in Q2, but stable with year-end 2023. They
see opportunity to nudge their duration given the average life of their loss reserves is just under 4
years. The yield on the portfolio was 4.5%, relative to current market yield that is above 5.0% (but less
than 5.25%). For investment funds, they are expecting around $10m a quarter in the short-term and
expect this to rise to around a more normalized $20m a quarter over time.
Liquidity and Capital
WRB said the have a comfortable surplus of capital. WRB's debt to capital ratio ended Q3 at
25.2%, lower than end of Q2 (26.7%) and below the YE 2023 level of 27.6%. There were $12.5m of
repurchases in the quarter / $126m of dividends (including $95m of special dividends) after $224m
of repurchases / $157m of dividends (including $127m of special dividends) in the prior quarter. In
the past WRB has used both share repurchase and special dividends as a way to return excess capital ;.
The company's payout ratio was 37.0% of operating earnings, relative to 91.1% in the Q2 (included a
special dividend), 10.0% in the Q1 and 77.0% in FY 2023.
WRB's call focused on pricing,
reserves, loss trend, investment
income, and underlying
conditions in the E&S market.
WRB's guidance included:
(1) expense ratio should be
comfortably below 30%, (2)
premium growth in the 10-15%
range, (3) consistent income
from the Argentinian inflation-
linked securities, (4) investment
funds returns around $10m a
quarter in the short-run, and
(5) tax rate at the high end of
the 23-24% range in the Q4 and
in the 23.5-24% area in 2025
(assuming no drastic change in
foreign earnings contribution).

Exhibit 2 - WRB Historical Pricing Commentary
Period Pricing Comments
Q3 2024
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8.4%, which was up modestly from 8.3% in the prior quarter. Pricing is being led by I
commercial auto followed by excess and umbrella. WRB noted the with the 8.4% pricing, the company is clearing the hurdle (of
loss cost) by a margin. On the reinsurance side, WRB said reinsurance companies are positioning themselves to achieve flat
pricing but they think it will be difficult for them to achieve that unless Milton proves to be uglier than expected.
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8.3%, which was above the 7,8% in the prior quarter. When asked about the
sequential acceleration, the company highlighted commercial auto as the leading candidate for the uptick given the line grew
almost 16%, which is being driven by higher rate. For the current year, the company noted they are building in a risk margin
that they feel is reasonably comfortable. The company highlighted that they have received 68% cumulative rate ex comp since
2019 with loss trend cumulative uptick below that. The company noted that professional liability ex D&O) is having a
reasonably good moment on both the admitted and non-admitted side while D&O continues to be challenged, specifically
transactional liability is very concerning and they are shrinking the line rapidly. WRB said there are many insurance
departments not operating in a timely manner and in some cases quite resistant to allows carriers on the commercial side to get
rate increases they need which is pushing business into the specialty and E&S market. The company pointed out that the E&S
business is probably growing at give or take 50% more than the standard market rate.
Q2 2024
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 7.8%, which was a touch below the 8.0% in the prior quarter. They said that despite
some commentary around E&S losing some momentum, they see the momentum for liability lines continuing as strong as ever
and pointed to property most likely being some of the slowing in the non-admitted market. They still think there is additional
momentum in property but it probably does not have the level of momentum it had last year. They are still seeing rate move up
in the line and expect they will continue to see it move up in the immediate future. For general liability, submission remains very
robust, both on the admitted and non-admitted side with the main driver being social inflation. They said commercial auto has
been in the cross-hairs of social inflation and they expect to see considerable firming in that line for that reason. In addition,
excess and umbrella to the extent it relates to commercial auto market. they expect to see firming there as well. In workers'
comp, they pointed to seeing signs of California rate bottoming out and think the rest of the country is probably a pace or two
behind. In D&O, their view is pricing has not bottomed yet but it is closing in on the bottom. On the reinsurance side, they
believe pricing is peaking but still view opportunity in the line as margins remain strong.
Q1 2024
Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8% in Q4, a touch below 8.5% in Q3, due to business mix. Overall they view this
8% as exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss trend. Within property cat reinsurance, WRB viewed the market at
1/1/24 as very attractive, but maybe not as attractive as at 1/1/23. Further, they highlighted that there is a distinction between
property cat and property per risk reinsurance. They also said there is a distinction with the primary property market, where
they are pushing hard on rate, and it is sticking. Rate excluding workers' compensation was 8% in Q4, a touch below 8.5% in
Q3, due to business mix. Overall they view this 8% as exceeding any reasonable assumption around loss trend. Within
property cat reinsurance, WRB viewed the market at 1/1/24 as very attractive, but maybe not as attractive as at 1/1/23. Further,
they highlighted that there is a distinction between property cat and property per risk reinsurance. They also said there is a
distinction with the primary property market, where they are pushing hard on rate, and it is sticking. They spoke positively about
business continuing to go to the E&S market.
Q4 2023
WRB is very focused on social inflation and they said that you can see that in their rate increases (8.5% excluding workers'
compensation) and they intend to stay on top of it. The market has been accepting of its rate increases as shown in its steady
renewal retention of 80%. Specifically WRB is pushing very hard on rate within commercial auto and the market is accepting of
it - this led to strong growth in commercial auto in the quarter.
Q3 2023
WRB saw rate of 8.2% (ex workers' comp), which was relatively stable with the Q1 (at 8.3%) and reflective of its business mix.
WRB said that there continues to be a bifurcation in the standard market and E&S market. Within the standard market, where
National carriers do not have an appetite to write business that is leading to opportunities on the E&S side. WRB said that
submission flow remains robust, and they are encouraged about activity over the balance of the year, and flagged good results
in July. Overall WRB's view is that the industry is struggling with the balance between rate needs and keeping up with loss
trend versus their desire to grow.
Q2 2023
Source: Company reports and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Period
Pricing Comments
Q1 2023
Regarding property, the company noted that its disappointment in Q4 pricing discipline has improved month over month,
resulting in what is regards as real progressing being made on the pricing front in April. The company feels the rationalization of
pricing in the property market, while more pronounced on the cat side, is broad-based overall. The company called out public
D&O, certain professional liability lines, and commercial auto as being the most irrational parts of the market. Still, WRB does
see pockets of opportunities even within professional liability, especially if written on an E&S basis.
WRB said they were disappointed in the discipline in property pricing in the Q4 as they said many carriers failed to take into
account limited reinsurance capacity and higher reinsurance costs. They believe that property pricing should continue to
improve as 2023 develops. For workers' comp, they said they missed the timing on when the market would begin to harden and
they expect pricing to be bumpy in 2023 with expectation for considerable firming in 2024 and beyond given severity trends,
particularly medical inflation. For auto, they said there is rate to be had but remains the most susceptible line to social inflation
and requires thought and judgement in underwriting for loss costs. Umbrella and general liability excess are amongst the
brighter opportunities with one area on the cautious watchlist being large account excess lines. Professional liability is a tale of
two stores with D&O being pressured given the rising competitive landscape but other lines within professional liability should
provide good opportunities. WRB said they participated at 1/1 renewals and said the clock is right to lean in with good discipline
with the US offering more attractive returns than international.
Q4 2022
Q3 2022
The marketplace remains an interesting one from their perspective - there are pockets of the market that remain extremely
attractive and there are others where there is a surprising level of competition. In the specialty space, and in particular the E&S
market remains extremely attractive to WRB. Berkley said that they have the ability to pivot into product lines as opportunities
emerge and that they could become a more active participant (for perhaps a year or two). They did flag both workers'
compensation and professional lines (particularly public company D&O) as lines become increasingly competitive.
Top line remains very healthy. WRB is seeing continued growth in submissions within Specialty and E&S and is beginning to
see resilience in the reinsurance market. WRB does not see short-term headwinds to de-rail growth off of their 15-25% growth
target, which they have been achieving. Within Insurance, seeing good growth in Other Liability and commercial auto is robust.
In workers' comp, WRB expects the market to bottom and start to firm over the next 12-24 months, reflecting loss cost severity
and erosion of pricing power we have seen; medical inflation is likely to increase rapidly and workers' comp is not insulated from
that. Despite concerns around the economy and a recession, WRB noted that audit premiums are seeing considerable
momentum, up 45% YOY.
Q2 2022
Q1 2022
Continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something measured in the hundreds of basis points. New business pricing
is currently outpacing renewal pricing by about 2 points. Retention remains well within range and will continue to take rate as
weeded. Submission flow in the E&S market is very strong & encouraging, not seeing standard carriers entering the market
eroding any current opportunities. Feel that WC is still facing a difficult pricing environment but will eventually come back.
There's nothing that leads us to believe that we will not continue to see rate increases that outpace trend by something
measured in the hundreds of basis points. Opportunities remain in the workers comp market, but one needs to be very cautious
and most of the growth seen is really being driven by payroll growth. We are starting so to see some folks being very aggressive
on WC pricing in addition to leaning through on commissions. Submission flow in the E&S market is pretty overwhelming at this
stage, particularly in January, and we don't really see standard carriers entering the market eroding any current opportunities.

Summary of Estimate Changes
Estimates lowered. See below for an overview of our estimate changes following Q3 2024 earnings.
. 2024 EPS is down to $4.00 (from $4.03) as we incorporate a high Q4 cat load given Milton (we
assume about $44m of losses from Milton in the Q4) and assume a modestly lower investment
funds return.
. 2025 EPS is up to $4.40 (from $4.25) reflecting a better underlying loss ratio, higher fixed NII and
modestly lower cat load vs our prior estimate (FY cat load is 2.2 pts).
. 2026 EPS is up to $4.80 (from $4.70) reflecting a better underlying loss ratio, higher fixed NII and
modestly lower cat load vs our prior estimate (FY cat load is 2.2 pts).

Valuation
Current Valuation. WRB trades at 2.76x Q3 2024 book value, which is above the 5-year and 10-
year average multiples of 2.29x and 1.93x, respectively. The 5-year minimum is 1.42x and 10-year
minimum is 1.24x. The 5-year and 10-year max is 2.99x, which is above where the shares are currently
trading. We do note that for the P&C sector price-to-book valuations are fuller given the unrealized
losses we have seen in this rising interest rate environment. For WRB, if we exclude AOCI, the shares
are trading at just around 2.5x adjusted Q3 book vs the 5-year average of 2.07x. On a P/E basis, WRB
is trading at 13.9x our 2025 EPS estimate, which compares favorably to the 5-year and 10-year
average multiples of 15.5x and 16.8x, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year maxes are around 25.0x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on shares of WRB. We believe that WRB is positioned to continue to see a healthy level of rate increases and
growth in 2024 and 2025, which we do not believe is currently reflected in consensus expectations.
Target Price Valuation for WRB: $68.00 from $63.00
. Our price target of $68 is based on just around 2.6x our 2025 estimated book.
· Our price target also represents a ~15.4x multiple against our 2025 EPS estimate.
· The 14.8x is a slight discount to where WRB has historically traded as we look to be conservative given social inflation impacting both
current and prior accident years.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WRB
Risks to achieving our price target include a slowdown in the firming pricing environment, a spike in inflation resulting in higher loss costs
and underlying margins falling short of expectations, adverse reserve development, and a high level of catastrophe losses.

Important Disclosure for U.S. Clients
This report was prepared by Wells Fargo Securities Global Research Department ("WFS Research") personnel associated with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells
Fargo Securities").
WFS Research may, from time to time, provide clients with short-term trading views in its research reports regarding subject companies on which Wells Fargo
Securities currently has equity research coverage. A short-term trading view offers a view on how the market price of a subject company's common equity may
trend in absolute terms during the 30 days following the date of the short-term trading view. A short-term trading view on a subject company's common equity
does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
