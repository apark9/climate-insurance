EQUAL WEIGHT

There is a lot of unpack - both on the 4Q print and other developments. We continue to be
impressed with AIG's execution of its key initiatives and want to be more constructive on the
stock. We are gaining a closer understanding of the pro-forma balance sheet, though some
questions remain. It is encouraging that AIG guided $3.9bn of buybacks in 2022 and 60-65% FCF
conversion for L&R including a $400-600mn dividend, a 2-3% yield on BV (post IPO). Lastly, AIG
anticipates having flexibility of use of IPO proceeds and a path to achieve a 10% ROE. Minority
IPO target: 2Q22, retain majority ownership following IPO. We also recognize 2 notable
achievements: 1.) An underlying combined ratio <90% (ahead of exit '22 expectation); and 2.)
Leverage below 25%.

1.) $8.3bn promissory note: Last quarter we acknowledged SAFG, the holding co. for L&R,
declaration on Nov. 1st of a $8.3bn dividend payable via intercompany debt to AIG that is due
prior to its public offering, based on our read of the 3Q 10Q. On the 4Q earnings call, AIG
confirmed our interpretation that it will use the majority of the SAFG promissory note proceeds
(from the issuance of debt at the SAFG level) to redeem part of AIG Inc. debt. End goal: AIG Inc.
leverage low 20s and L&R leverage high 20s. Since L&R's ~$8bn debt proceeds will go to AIG Inc.
(no corresponding contra asset for L&R), we expect incremental debt to compress L&R's adj.
segment common equity. Currently AIG has allocated $6.9bn of debt to L&R's segment balance
sheet. Taken together, $15bn of debt at L&R implies $35-40bn of BV equity to arrive at a high 20s
leverage, which feels impractical. We think AIG may update its presentation of debt allocation
amongst its segments, putting segment balance sheet items in flux. We would like to
understand if the separation would lead to any revaluation of historical carrying values that is
allocated to L&R and the split of Other Operations between L&R and Gl. Side note, it appears
that NCI related to the BX deal is parked in other operations, not L&R segment balance sheet.

2.) LDTI appears manageable: AIG expects to decrease shareholders equity of $1-3bn at
January 1, 2021 (transitional date, new rules go into effect in 2023). AIG is leaning towards the
low end of this range. We were struck by the reference of a gain to retained earnings (there is a
balance act between retained earnings and AOCI). On the margin, higher retained earnings
could slightly impact analysis of financial metrics excluding AOCI, i.e. adjusted ROCE. On the
flipside, it appears that AIG calculates leverage including AOCI. Again given the $1-3bn range,
the corresponding impacts to metrics are on the margin.

3.) S&P Capital Model Proposal: See our thoughts: AIG, Inc .: Quick Thoughts: S&P's Proposed
Capital Model and AIG 17 Feb '22. While we raised concerns about the extent parent co liquidity
Barclays Capital Inc. and/or one of its affiliates does and seeks to do business with companies
covered in its research reports. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a
conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this
report as only a single factor in making their investment decision.

($10.7bn as of YE21) can be deployed for uses outside operating company needs under the
purview of the S&P proposal, we are still including in our estimates full utilization of AIG's
targeted $3.9bn of buybacks in 2022. Recall AIG mentioned a reduction not eradication of the
benefits of hold co liquidity.
3.) 10-K quick takeaways (details in the note): 1.) Cat Reinsurance Renewal: Lower worldwide
aggregate coverage to $1.1bn from $2.05bn (with less staggered attachment points). Expanded
per occurrence protection within regional towers. With less aggregate cover, we suspect AIG
could be subject to multiple reinstatement premiums if 2022 shapes up to be a frequent cat
year. We also suspect there was less reinsurance capacity for aggregate cover at 1/1 renewals.
2.) Lower PMLs in '21 vs. '20 (doesn't reflect Jan. 1 '22 reinsurance update). 3.) PYD CY '21:
Outside WC and short tail lines (and to a modest extent excess casualty) AIG showed adverse
reserve development (balance longer tail lines). 4.) Collectively AIG received $5.1bn in cash and
fixed maturities from GI and L&R subs in 2021.
3.) Management signaled a path to 10% ROE - however a walk to get there not shared. AIG's
achievement of a 9.9% adjusted ROCE this quarter was partly driven by higher than typical
alternative investment returns and slightly offset by worse FV changes to bonds, contributing
~90 bps to its adj. ROCE.
Valuation: Our $61 PT, up from $59, reflects a 50/50 weighting of 11.0x our blended 2022 and
2023 EPS estimates of $5.30 and $5.87 (previously $5.06 and $5.67), and 0.8x our blended 2022
and 2023 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimates of $76.79 and $82.50 (previously $75.29 and
$80.50).

Why EQUAL WEIGHT?
We view AIG as a wait-and-see
proposition as it goes down the
complex path of separating L&R as
well as ongoing initiatives to achieve
underwriting margin objectives.
Upside case
USD 65.00
Eventual successful separation of L&R
that yields a fair market value resulting
in a rerating of AIG RemainCo. Our
upside case assumes ~12.3x our '22
EPS estimate.
Downside case
USD 50.00
Adverse reserve development
accompanying expansion of
underwriting risk appetite too fast too
soon. Our downside case assumes
~9.4x our '22 EPS estimate.

10-K Quick Takeaways
· Subsidiary dividend payments: AIG changed their reporting of its contributions from
operating companies as it no longer distinguishes operating dividends, rather, AIG
references cash/fixed maturities proceeds. Therefore, we are less clear if we can truly make
year over year comparisons. AIG received $5.1bn from operating subs in '21 consisting of
$2.3bn of cash and fixed maturity securities from GI and $2.8bn of cash from L&R. In
comparison, AIG received $1.8bn of subsidiary dividends in '20 consisting of $1.3bn from GI
and $473mn from L&R. Undisclosed 2022 ordinary dividend capacity allowance, will
become available upon annual statutory filings.
. Net PMLs are down y/y but these figures do not reflect January 1 reinsurance
updates ... World-wide all peril (1-in-250) - net after tax to $3.316bn from $3.872bn. U.S.
Hurricane (1-in-100) - net after tax to $920mn from $1.035bn, U.S. Earthquake (1-in-250) net
after tax to $873mn from $980mn. Japanese Typhoon (1-100) net after tax to $453mn from
$445mn and Earthquake (1-in-250) net after tax to $388mn from $481mn. Terrorism
exposure in NYC (net of TRIPRA reflecting a 5 ton truck bomb) steady fell to $1.3bn from
$1.7bn.
.
... Reinsurance updates: more per occurrence protection less aggregate protection.
With less aggregate cover, we suspect AIG could be subject to multiple reinstatement
premiums if 2022 shapes up to be a frequent cat year. We also suspect there was less
reinsurance capacity for aggregate cover at 1/1 renewals. AIG characterized total aggregate
reinsurance spend to be modestly down.
o 2022 worldwide aggregate property catastrophe program protection decreased to
$1.1bn from $2.05bn. The maximum aggregate retention globally, after the impact of
the per occurrence deductibles, is $600 million for 2022 (down from $750mn in 2021).
· Regional tower changes: NA per occurrence protection for personal lines held steady at
$1.275 billion however the first $275mn is only partially placed (vs. 100%), NA per
occurrence protection for commercial lines increased to $1.75bn from $1.0 billion,
NA aggregate decreased to $1.1bn from $2.05bn.
· On the frequency side, NA per occurrence protection retentions increased to $250mn
from $200mn (except Southeast/Gulf at $500mn). Likewise, NA aggregate retention
dropped to $400mn from $500mn.
o Rest of the world regional tower: Japan per occurrence protection increased to $1.45
billion from $550mn (both attach in excess of $200mn), Rest of World per occurrence
protection increased to $1.3bn from $300mn (both attach in excess of $100mn).
o Rest of World and Japan aggregate decreased to $1.1bn from $2.05bn. Rest of World and
Japan aggregate attachment point changes: $160mn and $250mn, respectively, up from
prior $100mn and $200mn, respectively.
· PYD reserve development major moving parts: Total 2021: $115mn of reserve releases
reflects favorable: $383mn in workers compensation, $413mn U.S. personal, other products
$110mn, UK/Europe Property and Special Risks of $118mn and UK/Europe and Japan
Personal Insurance of $173mn. Offset by unfavorable development: $7mn other casualty,
$521mn U.S. Financial lines, $189mn U.S. Property and Special Risks, $210mn of UK/Europe
Casualty and Financial lines, and other products of $74mn. AIG experienced more
unfavorable development in accident years 2016-2018, years that are out of scope with its
18 February 2022

ADC. Lastly, NICO is the beneficiary of most of AIG's favorable PYD for workers
compensation.
4Q Highlights
EPS Beat: AIG's 4Q21 Operating EPS of $1.58 was above our $1.22 estimate and $1.19 consensus
Street estimate. The beat primarily reflects better-than-expected NII and better combined ratio
(92.4% vs. our estimated 93.1%).
Relative to our estimates, AIG reported slower GI premium growth of 7% y/y vs. our 11%
expectation. Premium slowdown seen within personal lines, ex A&H (down 12% y/y). Alternative
investment income appears more pronounced in GI ($458mn above trend) than L&R ($299mn
above trend). However, it feels like NII was inflated in GI and L&R since a healthy haircut for
eliminations was taken in other operations ($469mn).
Significant variances: On the revenue side, better-than-expected after-tax alternative returns
of $676mn contributed ~$0.80 to EPS and worse than expected FV change on fixed maturity
securities detracted $73mn (~$0.09) from EPS.
Earnings Mix Shift: GI adj. earnings now surpass L&R. Typically L&R is a larger earnings
contributor than GI. We saw this quarter L&R report adj. pre-tax income of $969mn. (Note from
Nov. 2 through YE21 the NCI portion was $89mn.) In comparison, GI reported adjusted pre-tax
income of $1.5bn.
Cat losses as expected: $189mn vs. our $200mn estimate.
Asset Management:
AIG entered into a long-term asset management relationship with Blackstone, pursuant to
which Blackstone is managing an initial $50bn of L&R's existing investment portfolio, with
annual increases of $8.5bn for the next five years. Ultimately BX will manage $92.5bn of assets.
During 4Q, AIG incorporated BX into its ALM process, finalized investment guidelines and is
originating new asset classes. It appears that AIG is trying to optimize the operating model and
AUM fee structure. We suspect there is sensitivity by AIG talking about this on a public call since
optimization probably means a lower headcount of internal asset managers.
Pricing moderation in 4Q is more noticeable in
International than NA
Global Commercial pricing in 4Q21 dropped to +10% from +12% in 3Q21, +13% in 2Q21, +15% in
1Q21 and +15% in 4Q20. Digging into the segment contributions, International Commercial
pricing declined sequentially to +9% from +13%. In contrast, NA Commercial pricing was steady
q/q at +11% following sequential moderation in prior quarters: 2Q21 (+13%), 1Q21 (+15%) and
4Q20 (+21%). Even though NA commercial lines pricing held up better than commercial, we saw
moderation of premium growth in NA while Intl Commercial NPW growth held up. Specifically,
NA Commercial NPW grew +11% y/y vs. the 3Q print of +18% y/y. Conversely, Intl Commercial
NPW grew grew +15% y/y, same as the 3Q print.

Prior year reserve development: In total, AIG recorded $44mn favorable. Looking through the
moving parts, we are paying attention to the $69mn unfavorable development for accident
years 2016 through 2020. We are watching these accident years that predated some of AIG's
remediation efforts and are post its ADC (2015 and prior).
Underwriting Margin Expansion
Underwriting - Achievement of underlying CR under 90% ahead of YE'22 target: Compared
to the prior quarter, GI's underlying CR (89.8%) improved ~70 bps sequentially (90.5% in 3Q21)
and was better than our 4Q estimate (90.2%). Underlying CRs from here? Notwithstanding
quarterly variability owed to different underlying business mixes, AIG expects to see further
improvements through 2022 and likely into accident year 2023, thanks to rate exceeding loss
trend. Property is an area that appears to remain firm to contend with inflationary spike. AIG did
point out that it is investing in underwriting teams, especially on the A&H side. That may slow
18 February 2022
6
Barclays | AIG, Inc.
down expense savings improvements in our view. Also A&H business comes with higher policy
acquisition costs. We are modeling underlying combined ratios of 89.5% in 2022E and 89.0% in
2023E.
Catastrophe Management
Higher Cat Load New Normal
AIG has pegged a 2022 cat load above its AAL to reflect inflationary pressures. While AIG feels
good about all the structural changes it has made and reductions in PMLs, AIG wants to be
conservative when thinking about a cat load. We would have liked to hear quantification of its
cat load. A higher cat load is not reflected in AIG's combined ratio targets that exclude
catastrophe losses and PYD. We expect elevated non-modeled events to be the new normal
and had raised our catastrophe estimates across our P&C coverage when we published our '22
Outlook, see: Non-Life Insurance: UPDATE: 2022 Outlook: Reserves and Inflation in Focus (05
Jan. 2022).
PCG Portfolio Update in Response to Catastrophe Developments
AIG's high net worth property homeowners product to be offered exclusively on an non-
admitted basis in certain states including CA. We think that these accounts will not roll over
easily to Lexington. A broker has to prove that three admitted writers declined the risk. We can
see take up by competition with exceptions. CA is a displaced market, we can see a more likely
migration of risk to E&S. Likewise, AIG tends to offer large limits, not every insurer has the same
latitude.
Model Updates
Our 2022E operating EPS is $5.30 (prior $5.27), and $5.87 in 2023E (prior $5.76). Our updated
book value per share ex AOCI for YE22E is $76.79 (prior $75.46), and for YE23E is $82.50 (prior
$80.64). Our price target of $61 (prior $59) is based on 50/50 weighted average using unchanged
11x our blended 2022/2023 EPS estimates and 0.8x 2022/2023 BVPS (ex-AOCI).
. Raised our '22 buyback assumptions to $3.9bn from $2bn. Majority of the buybacks to be
completed in 1H22.
. Further underlying margin expansion, we trimmed AYCR ex cat by 30 bps per our '22
estimate and AYCR ex cat by 50 bps per our '23 estimate.
· Lowered NA personal lines top line growth reflecting its PCG portfolio update in certain
states.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

the same 12-month period.

Barclays Equity Research's "Top Picks" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry (as defined by the relevant
"industry coverage universe"), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that industry. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-
rated stocks in their published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one "Top Pick" for each industry. To view the current list of Top
Picks, go to the Top Picks page on Barclays Live (https://live.barcap.com/go/keyword/TopPicks).

Valuation Methodology: Our Equal Weight rating and $61 price target are based on a 50/50 weighted average of 11x our blended 2022 and 2023 EPS
estimates of $5.30 and $5.87 and 0.8x our blended 2022 and 2023 book value per share (ex-AOCI) estimates of $76.79 and $82.50. Our target multiples
for AIG are below the P/C insurance group given we expect lower ROEs, especially for GI standalone.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Potential calls on capital to complete a separation.
Expansion of underwriting risk appetite too fast too soon and/or over exuberance at hardening pricing that falter AIG's resolve to walk away from
business that does not meet risk return hurdles. Unexpected adverse reserve development which would not only impair earnings or capital but
undermine the creditability of its underwriting remediation actions to date. Ultimately we think a smaller capital base post separation may temper
AIG's ability to compete at the upper end of the market where we see less trading partners.
