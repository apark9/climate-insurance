Adj Operating EPS of $1.30 beat our estimate of $1.24 and consensus $1.23, primarily driven by
lower cat losses and better than expected underlying loss ratios in North American Commercial
Lines and Global Personal Lines. General Insurance pretax income came in at $1,233mn which
was better than our expected $1,181 as the underlying loss ratio beat more than offset a
modestly higher expense ratio than we expected. AIG also provided an estimate of ~$500mn
pretax before reinstatement premiums for catastrophe losses in 1Q25 related to the California
wildfires which came in a bit higher than we anticipated, but still at a manageable level relative
to BVPS. Further, AIG guided to a Core ROE of 10% plus in 2025 despite the impact of wildfires in
1Q. This comes in materially better than we expected and our current ROE estimate for 2025
including the wildfire impact is 9.6%. We will look to the call for more color on what is driving
the companies' increased confidence in the ROE.

NA Commercial - Strong underlying offset by adverse cats. 4Q combined ratio was 98.8% (vs
93.1% Barc and 91.6% Street), or 84.4% on a comparable basis excluding CRS and Validus Re.
This was driven primarily driven by higher cat loss of $301m (vs $184m Barc and $173m Street)
due to higher charges from Milton and adjustments from prior quarter adjustments related to
Helene, resulting in reported loss ratio of 75.4% (vs 69.6% Barc and 68.3% Street). Prior year
development was nearly flat in the quarter. Excluding the impact of cats and PYD, underlying
loss of 61.2% was slightly better than our 61.8% Street's 61.7% estimates. From a topline
standpoint, net written premiums grew 5% to $2.2b, or 9% on a comparable basis. The growth
was led by Casualty and Lexington Insurance (E&S), from a combination of strong new business
which grew 17% y/y as well as strong retention and positive rate trends.

Intl Commercial - Robust NPW growth and favorable cat/PYD drive CoR beat. 4Q combined
ratio improved by 240 bps to 83.2% (vs 86.2% Barc and 85.6% Street). The beat was driven by a
combination of favorable cat loss of $3m (vs $88m Barc and $76.2m Street) and higher favorable
PYD of $28.0m (vs $6.2m Barc and $7.7m Street). These factors resulted in reported loss ratio of
52.4% (vs 56.0% Barc and 56.1% Street), which more than offset a modest overage in expense
ratio (30.8% vs 29.3% Barc and 29.6% Street). From a topline standpoint, net written premiums
grew 9% to $2.1b, or 7% on a comparable basis, driven by strong new business and retention in
Global Specialty and Property.

Global Personal - Material CoR beat from favorable underlying losses, cat, and PYD. This is
a newly created segment, which combines International - Personal and North America -
Personal into one. 4Q combined ratio improved by 340 bps y/y to 95.4%, which beat our 101.9%
estimate. This was primarily driven by underlying loss ratio (52.6% vs our 53.8%) as well as
larger than expected favorability on cat losses ($21m vs our $90m) and PYD ($81m vs our $16m).
Net premiums grew 2% to $1.8b, or 5% on a comparable basis, driven by growth in High Net
Worth and Auto offset by lower Warranty.
Capital: The company repurchased $1.8b of stock and distributed $244m in dividends in 4Q. We
note that the buyback amount was higher than both our and the street's estimates of $1.6b. The
company ended the year with holdco liquidity of $7.7b due to $3.8b proceeds from sale of 21.6%
stake in Corebridge to Nippon Life and other transactions which have resulted in reducing AIG's
ownership stake to 22.7%.
CA Wildfire: $500 Million Net Loss. We note that this is modestly higher compared to our high-
end estimate of $400 million, which assumed 1.2% share of losses based on $30 billion industry
loss estimate. The loss occurrence may come close to the attachment point in Despite the
heavier cat load in 1Q25, AIG maintains their guidance of 10%+ core ROE inclusive of the impact
of the wildfires.
Reinsurance: The company launched a reinsurance Lloyd's syndicate via a multi-year strategic
partnership with Blackstone. It began underwriting on Jan-1 and will serve as a key component
of the company's reinsurance strategy, including improvements to terms and conditions of
many of its reinsurance treaties placed at Jan-1.
Other Operations: Starting in 4Q24, the company began excluding results of run-off businesses
that were previously reported in Other Operations from Adj Pre-Tax Income (APTI). Through the
recast, this segment now primarily consists of NII from Holdco liquidity, Corebridge dividend
income, corporate general operating expenses (GOE), and interest expense. For 4Q24, GOE
improved by $42m due to savings of AIG Next and reclassification of some GOE into General
Insurance.

Price (10-Feb-2025)
USD 75.09
Price Target
USD 90.00
Why OVERWEIGHT?
We are optimistic on AIG's balance
sheet strength and growth
prospects as it looks to re-lever its
balance sheet following years of
underwriting improvement and
expense cuts. The excess capital
levels over the next couple of years
should allow the company to
surprise to the upside on capital
deployment including distributions
through buybacks and dividends.
Upside case
USD 96.00
Our upside case reflects an increase
in ROE expectations to account for
improvement in profitability
stemming from current expense
management initiatives at play, in
addition to sustained benign claims
cost trend compared to the

Model Update
We updated our estimates to reflect the company's $500mn 1Q25E cat loss projection from the
CA wildfires, as well as other modest favorable adjustments to underwriting based on the
company's guidance for +10% Operating ROE inclusive of the wildfire losses. We have also
updated our model to reflect the new operating segmentation and changes made to the Other
Operations segment. Following our adjustments, our 2025E/2026E/2027E Adj Operating EPS
estimates changed from $6.64/$8.21/$9.59 to $6.24/$8.25/$9.64.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

Valuation Methodology: Our price target of $90 reflects a 1.0x P/BV xAOCI multiple on our 4Q25E BV xAOCI estimate which we derive from a P/BV vs
ROE regression, resulting in $82 standalone value, and adding $8 per share value from CRBG stake and deferred tax asset.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Downside Risks: We see the shares potentially
underperforming if AIG lets the greater levels of excess capital remain undeployed and ROE is constrained due to the ROE drag associated with it. This
could potentially cause negative EPS revisions. Additionally, if we are wrong about balance sheet strength and AIG's needs to adjusts reserves upward
it would likely weigh on the stock.

Barclays Israeli branch previously held an investment marketing license with the Israel Securities Authority but it cancelled such license on 30/11/2014
as it solely provides its services to eligible clients pursuant to available exemptions under the Advisory Law, therefore a license with the Israel
Securities Authority is not required. Accordingly, Barclays does not maintain an insurance coverage pursuant to the Advisory Law.

information about or description of the features of financial instruments not admitted for public offering and/or circulation in the Russian Federation

Sustainable Investing Related Research: There is currently no globally accepted framework or definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor
market consensus as to what constitutes a 'sustainable', 'ESG', 'green', 'climate-friendly' or an equivalent company, investment, strategy or
consideration or what precise attributes are required to be eligible to be categorised by such terms. This means there are different ways to evaluate a
company or an investment and so different values may be placed on certain sustainability credentials as well as adverse ESG-related impacts of
companies and ESG controversies. The evolving nature of sustainable investing considerations, models and methodologies means it can be
challenging to definitively and universally classify a company or investment under a sustainable investing label and there may be areas where such
companies and investments could improve or where adverse ESG-related impacts or ESG controversies exist. The evolving nature of sustainable
finance related regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific regulatory criteria also means that there is likely to be a degree of divergence
as to the interpretation of such terms in the market. We expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations in this field to continue to evolve.
