Price Target Change - April 19, 2023
Commercial Lines Insurance
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
TRV: Surprised with the Move in the Shares Post Earnings; Conference Call Round-Up
WELLS
FARGO
Our Call
TRV was bullish on commercial pricing and is focusing on improving its auto results and
saw a better-than-expected underlying margin in Business Insurance (BI). With that being
said, we were surprised with the move in the shares.
Surprised with the move in the shares today: TRV traded up given the strong BI margins
and bullish commentary around commercial pricing, which was well-received given that
HIG previewed weaker commercial results. Further, TRV numbers should go higher as the
better BI margin and higher NII, counter-balance weaker personal auto results. With that
being said, we were still surprised with the 7.6% move (vs. flat S&P) but believe the stock
may have also been shorted into the print.
Estimate and price target changes: Our 2023 EPS estimate goes to $14.85 (from
$14.95), 2024 EPS goes up to $18.10 (from $18.00) and our 2025 EPS goes to $20.55
(from $20.30) to reflect weaker personal auto results, counter-balanced by slightly better
Business Insurance results and higher earned premiums. Our price target is now $183
(from $182) reflective of similar multiples on slightly higher EPS/book value.
Read thrus: (1) Strong commercial pricing as shown by the sequential acceleration in the
BI RRC, (2) exposure decelerated in the quarter but remains at historically high levels, (3)
personal auto margins continue to struggle despite uptick in RPC as TRV still needs more
rate to reach rate adequate levels, and (4) Travelers took a modest level of D&O losses
within its BSI book, which drove the Y/Y deteriorating in margin, and we believe points to
manageable exposure for the industry.
Strong results in BI: BI saw a 89.6% underlying combined ratio, with the underlying loss
ratio improving 1.8 points and benefiting from more favorable non-cat weather and
earning in price increases. TRV did not quantify the magnitude of the non-cat weather but
said the Q1 2023 underlying loss ratio was a good starting point for forward modeling.
TRV noted the pricing environment remains strong and property saw a continued
acceleration given hardening reinsurance market and capacity constraints.
Personal auto continues to struggle: TRV maintained they expect to reach written
price adequacy in the majority of states by mid-year, but noted it would take time to
show in the margins. Further, they said that they now need more price than they had
previously thought to get to rate adequate levels as vehicle replacement / repair costs and
BI severity remain elevated. TRV said they expect to see more pressure on PIF growth as
they push for more rate and work to get back to their target margins.

Takeaways for the Non-Life Insurance Group
The main takes that stand out from TRV to us, and the laterals for the rest of the group are
below. Net-net, the biggest takes are that TRV continues to see pretty poor personal auto results,
commercial lines continue to see strong rate (despite some exposure deceleration), and investment
income continues to be a strong tailwind for earnings as they raised their NII guide. Highlights of the
laterals that we see for the group follow below:
路 Commercial lines pricing benefiting from commercial property momentum. TRV said that its
renewal rates in BI were +4.7% in Q1, accelerating sequentially from +4.5% in Q4 showing pricing
still has legs despite seeing exposure start to come down. TRV did say that commercial property
rates continued to improve sequentially. The still strong pricing and strong new business growth
in commercial in addition to TRV not change in loss cost assumptions is a positive for the
commercial peers, especially after HIG previewed commercial lines results that were short of
expectations.
路 Exposure growth starting to show slowdown but still at good level. Exposure growth saw a
sequential downtick in BI in Q1 as TRV saw exposure growth of 4.9% vs the 5.6% in Q4, 5.1% in
Q3, and 5.2% in Q2 2022. When looking at the RPC, the lower exposure was only partially offset
by higher renewal rate change (TRV usually says that most of its exposure counts as rate). The still
good exposure levels should be a good sign for all insurance brokers. Further, TRV is more of a
small-middle market insurer (exposure in their select business actually accelerated), it is the
best take for AJG and BRO, but does point to a good quarter for the brokerage group in general.
A focus of other commercial insurers (AIG and CB) is usually on pure price (rate plus exposure)
so the slowdown in the BI RPC at TRV could imply lower price from others (with the caveat that
TRV did see a slowdown due to its heavier workers' comp concentration in Select).
路 As expected, personal auto continue to struggle. TRV printed a 103.4% personal auto underlying
combined ratio well above the company target of mid-90s to perhaps a range above the upper-
end of the mid-90s. We believe the Q1 result shows that despite the big uptick in RPC, these rates
take time to earn in and inflation has been higher for longer than carriers expected. A positive was
that TRV got a 19% rate in California, which is state that has started to get more rates approved
but the 19% was still well below the 40%+ indicated rate. These results highlight personal auto
carriers still need more rate and will take time to show in margins as most carriers are still not
near written price adequacy.
. Some D&O losses from the banking crisis, but level should be manageable. Within Bond &
Specialty, TRV attributed the 3.9 point Y/Y increase in its underlying combined ratio to financial
losses related to the banking crisis. Our sense is these were one off in nature and not expected to
continue in the Q2 and beyond. This means there losses were around $34 million and since they
have around a 4% share of the D&O market translates into an industry loss of just under $900
million, which we believe is modest and more than absorbable by the industry.
. After-tax fixed Income NII revised modestly up. The company modestly revised its fixed income
investment income guidance (after lowering it modestly last quarter), highlighting the volatility of
interest rates over the last few quarters. We believe this could perhaps point to modestly higher
investment income at other players, although we do not expect much to provide specific NII
guidance as most carriers don't provide specific guidance.CB guides one quarter ahead and HIG
preannounced NII that was also better than us.
路 Weaker alternative investment quarter. TRV saw modestly worse alts versus us at they saw a
pre-tax yield of 3.6% vs our estimate of 5.0% (real estate is only 2% of their total portfolio and the
majority is wholly owned properties carried at their depreciated historical cost i.e. not written up
when appraisal values are higher) and HIG also preannounced better than expected NII seeing a
2.5% return in their alt investments. Given TRV results and HIG's preannouncement, we expect
other insurers could beat our alternative investment income assumptions.

What the Companies Are Saying-TRV
Outlook. Within Business Insurance, Travelers was asked about rate picking up in the Q2 as there is a
higher percentage of property business within the book, and they said they are trying not to forecast /
provide guidance but did say that they are responding to the loss environment. Within personal lines,
Travelers said they are confident in the actions that they have taken / continue to take to improve
the profitability of the business as they move through 2023 and beyond. They noted the uptick in
Florida lawsuits did not have a major impact on their results as Florida is only 2% of their exposure but
noted the recent Florida legislation is encouraging and the state is being watched as a potential growth
opportunity.
Pricing. In Business Insurance, TRV said that within Business Insurance the renewal rate ticked up in
property, umbrella and auto. Pure rate did slow in Select (small accounts) in the quarter reflective of
a higher concentration of workers' compensation business in the Q1, although they did say that the
Select RPC was 10.0% and that a meaningful portion of the exposure behaves like rate. Broadly within
BI, TRV pointed to environmental factors helping with rate. These factors include: higher reinsurance
pricing, economic inflation, weather (including frequency and severity of events) and the tight labor
market. For personal lines, they expect the RPC to continue to rise in auto and to be modestly higher
than the 13.9% in Q1 during the other quarters of the year. In homeowners', they expect the RPC to
remain at these elevated levels (the RPC in homeowners' was 20.2% in Q1). Travelers did call out the
19% rate increase they received approval for in California last Friday (the 19% is versus an indicated
needed rate of 42%). Within Bond and Specialty, Travelers said that the 3.9% year-over year increase in
the underlying combined ratio was due to a higher expense ratio (1.8 points), with the remainder (2.1
points) due to losses from banking sector, partially offset by higher earned pricing.
Guidance. The exhibit below highlights TRV's commentary and expectations for 2023.
路 Fixed income investment guide raised. The only precise guidance that Travelers provides is
around its quarterly view for fixed income plus short-term investment income, on an after-tax
basis. TRV is now looking for fixed income and short-term investment income to be $530 million
after-tax in Q2, $555 million in Q3 and $575 million in Q4. This is up from a range of $515 million -
$560 million provided with Q4 earnings.
路 Personal auto needs more price. Within personal auto, TRV still expect to be at a rate adequate
level in the majority of their states by the middle of this year (at least close to it), but given
the elevated losses they are filing for more price than they previously had expected. On the
homeowners' side, Travelers expects its RPC to remain at levels that are consistent with the Q1.
Investments. TRV raised their fixed income and expects after-tax investment income of $575 million
in Q4 (up from the prior $560 million). The non-fixed income portfolio delivered positive returns (2.8%
in the quarter), but lower than last year (7.5% return in Q1 2021). Further, TRV said that only 10% of
its portfolio turns over on an annual basis, so it will take a while for the higher rates to fully impact the
run-rate of net investment income. Their non-fixed real estate exposure accounts for only about 2.4%
of their total portfolio, but 33% of their non-fixed portfolio, but the majority of the assets are wholly
owned properties (50% of real estate non-fixed exposure) that are carried at historical depreciated
values rather than market value (i.e. they have not adjusted those values for the uptick in appraisal
values over the years). They also have an additional 2.0% exposure to CMBS and REITs on the fixed side
with an average credit rate of Aal.
Liquidity and Capital. TRV has $1.6 billion of capital at the holding company (up from just under $1.5
billion at the end of 2022) with all of their capital ratios at or better than target levels (debt to capital
ratio is 21.3% in target range of 15-25%). They added $5 billion to their share repurchase program
with earnings (bringing the authorization up to $6.6 billion) and increased their dividend by 8% to
$1.00. Overall, they said their capital strategy is unchanged and there is no time horizon associated
with the buyback program.

Pricing Highlights-Personal Lines
Personal Lines-TRV Continues to See Rate Acceleration, but Margins Still Short Of Targets
路 Within Personal Auto, TRV saw renewal premium change continue to accelerate sequentially at
13.9%, which was up from the 11.4% last quarter; however, their auto underlying margin remained
above 100% for the fourth straight quarter and was up 4.6 points Y/Y highlighting the need for
additional rate (and the lag in these rates earning through), but did pull back from the 110.5% last
quarter (which was the highest CR since Q4 2016) as Q1 is a seasonally favorable quarter. They
said RPC should modestly increase from the 13.9% in Q1 and remain there for the remainder of
the year. They also said that they still expect written pricing will achieve rate adequacy (at least
be close to) in a majority of their states by mid-year 2023, but did not disclose their loss trend
assumptions other than noting that inflation has been higher for longer than they previously
thought. They also said they expect to see further headwinds to PIF growth as they focus on
getting to target margins. They highlighted they received a 19% rate in California last week, which
will come through in May 2023.
路 Homeowners' RPC also accelerated sequentially, jumping to a record-high 20.2%, up from 14.3%
last quarter. They expect the RPC in home to remain at these elevated levels for the remainder of
the year.
. Auto and Home PIFs decline sequentially showing new business pullback. Travelers' new
business in auto decreased 4% Y/Y to $277 million, after decreasing 3% Y/Y last quarter and
marked the second straight quarter with Y/Y declines as TRV is pulling new business away from
states where they are not getting enough rate and introducing stricter underwriting standards.
This is also reflected in the PIF numbers, as auto PIFs declined 1.0%, which was the biggest
sequential drop since Q1 2014. Home new business was flat Y/Y at $258 million and down from
the 4% Y/Y growth in the prior quarter. From a PIF standpoint, home saw a 0.3% sequential
decrease, which was a slowdown from the 0.2% sequential increase last quarter and the first
sequential decline since Q1 2015.

Valuation
Current valuation. The TRV shares are now trading at 1.84x Q1 2023 book value, which is above its 5-
year (1.45x) average, and its 10-year (1.40x) average multiple but below the peak level of 2.05x. The
P/B multiple continues to be elevated as reported book value has higher unrealized losses on TRV's
investment portfolio vs historical averages; when excluding unrealized losses (net), shares are currently
trading at 1.40x Q1 adjusted book of $123.11 (more in line with the 5- and 10-year averages). On a
price-to-earnings basis, the shares are trading at 12.3x our updated 2023 EPS estimate and 10.1x our
2024 EPS estimate versus the 5-year average of 11.8x, 10-year average of 11.6x and the 5-year and
10-year peak of 13.9x.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)
Investment Thesis
We believe that TRV will continue to benefit from the hard commercial market as pricing should continue to have legs given inflation and
higher weather volatility. Although we are positive on the commercial lines space as a whole, we are more cautious on TRV relative to peers
due to its smaller account exposure, higher workers' comp focus as both are getting less rate than other lines/account sizes, and personal
lines exposure, particularly auto, which is well above target margins of mid-90s. We still believe that risk remains around social inflation,
lower reserve releases, but we believe that these risks are adequately reflected in shares with the risk/reward now more neutral and rate
the shares Equal Weight as a result.
Target Price Valuation for TRV: $183.00 from $182.00
Our price target of $183 is based on around a ~1.6x multiple of our projected 2024 book value estimate of around $115.82 and just
around 10x our 2024 EPS estimate of $18.10.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and reported / underlying margins coming in better
than expected.

does not impact our fundamental investment rating or price target for that company, which reflect our view of how the subject company's common equity may
perform over a one-year period. A short-term trading view may reach a different conclusion than the firm's fundamental investment rating and price target for
a subject company and, therefore, short-term trading views could result in short-term price movements that are contrary to our fundamental investment rating
and price target. Short-term trading views are not ratings and the firm does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain, update or close out short-term
trading views. Short-term trading views may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any short-term trading views discussed in WFS Research reports.
