May '22 Earnings: PIF Decline (again)
Highlights Commoditization
With monthly PIF declines since Nov. '21, personal auto PIF
compression could persist at least through YE22. If we don't see
PIF growth inflection in '23, we would question PGR's superior
franchise value. Especially after its first mover status in
curtailing rate increase actions (except key states).

We appreciate your consideration in the Institutional Investor All-America & All-Canada Research
Survey 2022. View our analysts. Vote for Barclays.
PGR's underlying loss ratio of 73.0% in May deteriorated from 72.6% in April. On a seasonality
perspective, May tends to be worse than April. But so is June, being progressively worse. PGR's
PYD has been bouncing around, favorable and unfavorable by the month. PGR's catastrophe
losses (6 pts of its combined ratio) was more atypical, we suspect Midwest hailstorms impacting
auto physical damage to be the culprit (PCS events by catalog numbers: 2232, 2233, and 2235,
cumulatively comprise $2.3bn of industry losses reported thus far). Higher catastrophe losses
contributed to PGR missing its targeted 96% combined ratio (96.5% at May '22).
We expect PGR's monthly personal auto PIF growth (y/y) to remain negative at least
through YE22. We look at sequential PIF movements as a precursor, with monthly declines
transpiring since Nov. '21. May '22 personal auto PIF declined (1.8)% y/y (vs. our estimate of -
1.7%) driven by a slowdown in auto direct (+0.0% vs. our +0.2%) and auto agency (-4.1% vs. our
-3.9%). As PIF declines remain more evident in agency vs. direct, we expect PGR's customer mix
to continue to shift, with a greater bias to direct over time. To recap, direct represents 55% of
personal auto PIF in May '22. We are cautious about PGR's stance that the majority of personal
auto rate increases are behind them (with the exception of a few key states).

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving business
mix, which could lower ROEs. Likewise,
we struggle to see how PGR could
return to its historical PIF growth rate,
as the company cut rates early during
the pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 125.00
If PGR is able to achieve personal auto
rate adequacy and return to historical
PIF growth rates. If PGR leverages its
multivariate pricing model across
newer business lines. Upside case
reflects ~25x '23E EPS.
Downside case
USD 75.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with greater
rate catch up. Downside case reflects
~15x '23E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PIF growth y/y trend once again negative in May
PGR reported personal auto PIF growth of (1.8)% in April (vs. estimate of -1.7%), mostly seen in
auto agency (-4.1% vs. our -3.9%) and a slowdown in auto direct (+0.0% vs. our +0.2%). Personal
auto PIF growth on a m/m basis has been negative for 7 consecutive quarters: - 0.4% Nov. '21, -
0.4% Dec. '21, -0.3% Jan. '22, -0.1% Feb. '22, -0.4% March '22, -0.3% April and -0.2% May. We
look at sequential PIF declines as a precursor.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers rose 8.6% over the 12 months from
May 2021 to May 2022. Used car and truck CPI incline has been decelerating since March '22, yet
on an absolute basis 16.1% (May) remains severely elevated. We think CPI is a better indicator of
used car prices than Manheim, as the latter focuses on wholesale prices.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life
AIG, Inc. (AIG)
Chubb Limited (CB)

Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $90 PT is based on 16x EPS and 2.9x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2023E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
