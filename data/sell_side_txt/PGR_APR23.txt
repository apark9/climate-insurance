April 23' Earnings: PYD Continues as
expected
Despite a lower ER (17.1%) and improved AYLR ex cats of 71%,
PGR didn't meet its 96% CR target thanks to continued adverse
PYD (2.6 pts vs. our 2.0 pts estimate) and higher cat losses. FL
backlash persists and bodily injury and PIP were key drivers of
PYD. Conversely, in 1Q auto physical damage was the culprit of
PYD.
We are surprised that PGR cited FL legislation as a driver of adverse PYD, we assumed that was
"once and done." PGR is also the lone insurer citing this FL issue which gives us pause. Unlike 1Q
adverse PYD were PGR cited higher auto property and physical damage, this month the key
drivers of adverse PYD were bodily injury and PIP. In general, we are cautious about
Progressive's undeterred stance with respect to social inflation. Peers vocalize more concerns
about higher attorney representations more than PGR, especially on the commercial auto side.
Conversely, we continue to expect severity pressures to lead to adverse PYD, and modeling a
20% haircut in the preceding months in our forecast period (i.e. 2.1 pts in May and 1.7 pts in
June, etc.)
Combined ratio (i.e., bottom line) beat our estimates
PGR beat our combined ratio estimate (97.9% vs our estimated 99.3%) but was above
management's 96% target (Personal Lines at 96.2% vs our estimated 98.6%, Commercial Lines
at 93.1% vs our estimated 100.4%, and Property at 154.0% vs our estimated 108.0%).
· PGR reported a fifth consecutive month of unfavorable PYD of $144mn (vs. $101.4mn
estimate) or 2.6 pts on the loss ratio (vs. our 2.0 pt estimate). This follows 6.5 pts, 3.5 pts,
and 3.4pts of unfavorable PYD in January, February, and March, respectively.
o We estimate that adverse PYD hurt the personal lines auto loss ratio by 2.8 pts, as
personal auto represented 85% of total PYD due to FL claims and higher severity (PIP
and BI). Commercial auto made up 20% of the unfavorable PYD due to claims brought
forward ahead of FL reform implementation. Property had a favorable development (5%
of PYD) due to actuarial changes.
. PGR's underlying loss ratio of 71.0%, was better than our estimated 75.9%. PGR took
$27mn of actuarial adverse adjustments to its current AY, or 0.5 pts. We would have
expected a higher loss pick given the company's concerns about severity and needing to
take rate. We question if PGR's loss picks are too optimistic and would be subject to re-

estimates (i.e. unfavorable PYD) in future periods.
· PGR's expense ratio was at 17.1% in Apr. vs. 21.1% in Mar. and 20.6% in Feb. We estimated a
19.9% expense ratio. To recap, PGR's pre-pandemic expense ratio ran just north of 20%.
· PGR reported catastrophe losses of $393mn vs our $79mn estimate.
Top line growth (Policies in Force and Net Investment Income) outperformed our
expectations
Personal auto PIF grew +1.9% sequentially (Apr '23 vs. Mar '23), below the previous +2.1%
sequential print (Mar '23 vs. Feb '23). On an annualized basis, that would imply PIF growth of
23% (keeping monthly growth constant over 12 months), though there are seasonality
adjustments needed. On a y/y basis, PGR recognized positive personal auto PIF growth over the
last six months (+13.3% in Apr., +10.8% in Mar., +8.1% in Feb., +5.4% in Jan., +2.6% in Dec, and
+1.7% in Nov.).
PGR's pre-tax net investment income (ex expenses) this month was $142mn vs. our $136mn
estimate, reflecting a 3.0% pre-tax annualized book yield.
April operating EPS of $0.30 beat our $0.20 estimate, reflecting a lower combined ratio (97.9%
vs our 99.3% estimate) and 5% beat on NII. Combined ratio outperformed due to a lower
expense ratio and improved AYLR.
On May 12th, PGR renewed their company's share repurchase authorization of up to 25mn of
the company's common shares (~4.3% of shares outstanding).

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 152.00
PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~20x '24E EPS.
Downside case
USD 110.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~15x '24E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +13.3% in April (above our estimate of +11.8%), as
auto agency PIF (+8.2% vs. our +6.9%) and auto direct (+17.3% vs. our 15.9%) outperformed our
estimates.

Underlying combined ratio - lower underlying losses
and expense ratios
PGR's underlying combined ratio of 88.1% improved from 98.6% in Mar. and 91.2% in Feb.
driven by an improving underlying loss ratio of 71.0% (77.5% in Mar. vs 70.6% in Feb.) and lower
expense ratio (17.1% in Apr. vs 21.1% in Mar. and 20.6% in Feb.) The construction of PGR's
underlying combined ratio is different than pre-pandemic. To recap, PGR's pre-pandemic
underlying loss ratio stood at ~68% and expense ratio ran just north of 20%. For us to get more
constructive about the stock we would need to see a reversion to this pre-pandemic
composition.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
Our focus is on an absolute basis, where used car pricing remains elevated (see Figure 3).
Likewise, if we compare used car & truck pricing to Jan '19 levels, it is up 35.6% vs. all items at
20.5%. We pay lesser attention to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers,
which rose 4.9% over the 12 months from Apr 2022 to Apr 2023. Used car and truck CPI trails all
items at -6.6% in Apr vs. - 11.2% in Mar.
Manheim pricing was -3.1% m/m and -4.4% y/y. More importantly, if we compare Apr '23 to Apr
'20, Manheim pricing is still up 68.2%. Compounded auto pricing during that period has not
caught up - not anywhere close. There is still significant rate catch-up needed to see that
inflection point. It will be like an "x"; loss costs go down, then pricing goes up - where the two
intersect in our view can take a bit longer, especially given how long it is taking auto pricing to
actually "earn" in.

Valuation
Our PT of $123 (was $118) is based on 16.5x our new '24E EPS and 3.24x (from 3.20x) '24E BVPS
(ex AOCI).
Model Updates:
We increase our loss ratio expectations to reflect lower expense ratio and the continuation of
adverse PYD, albeit tempered from April levels, reflecting higher severity expectations. Lastly,
we are using a 3 month average AYLR as a starting point in May.
Updated Operating EPS: We revise '23E from $4.75 to $5.19 and '24E from $6.99 to $7.46.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":

*This is the closing price referenced in the publication, which may not be

Historical stock prices and price targets may have been adjusted for stock
splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Allstate Corp ..
E: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Allstate Corp. within

J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Allstate Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Allstate Corp. within the past 12 months.
L: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, an investment banking client of Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate.
M: Allstate Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC and/or
an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $122 price target is based on a 50/50 weighted average of our blended 11.5x our 2024 EPS and 1.78x our 2024 book value
per share ex AOCI.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Steeper acceleration of loss cost trends,
particularly on the severity side, which would pressure the company's margins. A prolonged period of low interest rates will likely pressure net
investment income. Allstate has substantial exposure to natural catastrophe losses, stemming from its large homeowners insurance business. Despite
the acquisition being relatively small, integration of National General could be challenging and lead to execution risk in combining business units
under one operational model.

CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related
derivatives.
K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC

Valuation Methodology: Our $123PT is based on 16.5x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2024E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double-digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
