Kinsale
3Q22: Ian Losses Elevated, But Mostly Offset By
Strong Core Margins and Investment Income
Hurricane Ian losses hurt KNSL's underwriting results but were easily absorbed by
favorable core underwriting margins and higher net investment income. We
consider KNSL a high-quality E&S franchise and expect it to perform well
through the underwriting cycle. Also, we think KNSL's financial results are likely
to exhibit positive momentum over the medium term as it unwinds excess reserves
on its balance sheet, writes business at favorable prices/terms, and benefits from
higher interest rates. Still, we remain Neutral on the stock given its valuation as
well as the risk of multiple compression when P&C pricing eventually turns
(recognizing that Ian may further extend the already long running hard market).
· EPS roughly in-line. KNSL reported 3Q22 operating EPS of $1.64, close to our
$1.63 estimate but well above consensus of $1.25. Compared to our model,
KNSL's underwriting margins were lower (-$0.12 per share), with elevated cat
losses ($26 million vs. $10 million est.) partly offset by strong core margins
(CoR ex. cats and PYD 76.4% vs. 80.5%E) and favorable reserve releases
($11 million vs. $7 million est.). However, the underwriting shortfall was more
than absorbed by higher net investment income (+$0.13), driven by growth in
invested assets and higher new money rates. Net written premiums rose +38.2%
from 3Q21, above our +33.0% assumption. Notwithstanding elevated
catastrophe losses this quarter, KNSL's past results have consistently exceeded
our expectations, and we think there could be further upside in our estimates
from a lower combined ratio, higher investment income, and premium growth.
· The overall operating environment remains favorable for KNSL. Although
price increases in the broader P&C market have slowed in recent years since
hitting a peak in 2020, KNSL has consistently reported price increases in the
low-double-digit range over the same timeframe. In our view, this is partly due
to the small account focus of KNSL, a market that has historically been more
insulated from the boom-bust pricing cycles of larger accounts. If large account
pricing continues to trend down, small account pricing could follow suit.
However, we think that that losses from Hurricane Ian (and its implication for
reinsurance pricing) could be another catalyst to extend the hard market. KNSL
reported an average policy size (a proxy for pricing trends) of $14,700 in 3Q22,
up 13% from $13,000 in 3Q21.
· Other points of interest from the quarter: (1) Although not disclosed by
KNSL, the magnitude of catastrophe losses in 3Q22 seems to suggest a close to
full retention loss from Ian (KNSL has a $25 million per event retention). Given
KNSL's push into property lines and its faster growth in Florida in recent years,
management's approach to writing catastrophe-exposed property could be an
area of focus with investors. (2) There could be questions about the sustainability
of the 3Q22 AY loss ratio of 57.2%, which declined 62 bps from 3Q21 and a
much larger 410 bps from 2Q22. (3) The COVID accident years (2020 and 2021)
continue to develop favorably against initial loss picks.

Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that operates
exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small
commercial accounts. Our long-term outlook for KNSL is
upbeat given its large addressable market, superior technology
platform, and low cost base, which we view as a sustainable
competitive advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full
and we are concerned about the risk of multiple compression
as the P&C pricing cycle continues to turn.

KNSL will hold its earnings
conference call at 9:00 AM Eastern
on October 28, 2022.
The dial-in number for the call is
888-660-6493; code: 3573726.
The call replay will be available on
https://ir.kinsalecapitalgroup.com.
We affirm our Neutral rating. We expect KNSL's premiums and margins to
benefit from favorable trends in the E&S market, which continues to generate
outsized growth at attractive pricing/terms. Also, we think that Kinsale's low-cost
operating model is a sustainable competitive advantage across the pricing cycle,
especially against higher cost competitors like Lloyd's writers. On the other hand, the
stock's valuation is full compared to commercial peers and specialist names even
after accounting for KNSL's growth potential and above-average margins. Further,
while favorable P&C market conditions are likely to persist through 2023 and will
have positive implications for KNSL's reserves and future earnings, the eventual turn
in the P&C pricing cycle is a downside risk to its above-average multiple.
Well-Positioned to Capitalize on Favorable P&C Market
We expect the overall E&S market, where KNSL operates exclusively, to see strong
but moderating new business flows and price hikes over time, partly due to more
underwriters focusing on growth and greater appetite from admitted markets. Still,
we think KNSL can grow premiums at a healthy pace because of its relatively small
base as well as the fragmented nature of the pricing cycle whereby certain lines
(property, marine) are only beginning to benefit from harder prices despite a
slowdown in other lines and/or the broader market. With respect to profitability, we
expect the combination of price hikes - historical and prospective - and conservative
reserving to support healthy margins at KNSL over the medium term.
Low Expenses a Durable Competitive Advantage
KNSL operates with a proprietary and fully integrated technology platform that it
built from the ground up, in contrast to many of its peers that use unwieldy hybrid
systems consisting of legacy platforms and newer technologies. The net result has
been an operating model that has the capacity to take on significant business volumes
without sacrificing customer responsiveness, underwriting quality, and expense
efficiency. With this model, our view is that KNSL will outperform higher cost
competitors (especially Lloyd's which is more than 20% of the E&S market) through
the pricing cycle. During softer markets, KNSL can grow premiums as others pull
back while maintaining above-average profitability. In hard markets, Kinsale can
operate as a price taker and generate an even larger excess return.
Eventual Turn in Pricing Cycle Is a Risk
The P&C industry is well into the current hard market and we expect overall price
hikes to moderate over time as re/insurers re-position themselves for growth
(property and catastrophe coverage likely to be the exception to this rule in the near
term). Given this, we see multiple compression as a risk as pricing/volume swings
tend to be more volatile in E&S given its function as a safety valve for P&C. While
we believe that some portion of recent market share gains by the E&S industry are
permanent and that KNSL will thrive even if prices soften, our view is that a
reasonable valuation analysis will have to look several years out because of KNSL's
above-average growth profile and would therefore have to account for how
conditions in the P&C market are likely to be at that future time.

Raising Estimates
We are increasing our EPS estimates (4Q22 from $1.91 to $2.03, 2022 from $7.08
to $7.20, 2023 from $8.16 to $9.06) to reflect higher investment income and
modestly better underwriting margins.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Kinsale Capital (Neutral; Price Target: $250.00)
Investment Thesis
We affirm our Neutral rating. KNSL is the only publicly traded P&C insurer that
operates exclusively in the E&S insurance market with a focus on small commercial
accounts. Our long-term outlook for KNSL is positive given its large addressable
market, superior technology platform, and low cost base, which we view as a
sustainable competitive advantage. Still, the stock's valuation seems full at current
levels and we are concerned about the risk of multiple compression as the P&C
pricing cycle continues to moderate.
Valuation
We are raising our December 2023 price target from $230 to $250 given the
increase in our EPS estimates. Our price target assumes a 4.3x P/BV target multiple
on 2025 book value and a 21x P/E target on 2025 EPS. These target multiples are
well above peers', which we believe is supported by KNSL's above-average
premium growth (long-term low-to-mid teens growth versus mid-to-high single-digit
growth for most large commercial peers) and margin profile (80-85% combined ratio
versus 85- 90% for peers). KNSL trades at 10.1x book value, well above the
specialty peer average (ex. PLMR) of 2.2x and commercial peers at 1.6x.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We believe the main upside risks to our rating and price target are:
· The hard P&C market lasts longer than expected. Kinsale is seeing higher
prices and greater submission flow because of dislocation in the P&C market. If
current conditions persist longer than we assume, there could be upside to our
forecasts and investor sentiment would likely improve.
· Premium growth surpasses already elevated expectations. In our view, part of
KNSL's premium valuation is attributable to its above-average growth. We
would expect KNSL's valuation multiple to expand if it consistently exceeds
growth expectations in the next few years.
· Margin improvement is greater than assumed. The combination of earned
pricing exceeding loss cost trends and management's conservative reserving
suggests margin improvement in the next few years. If KNSL's margin
improvement tracks higher than expectations, there could be upside to forecasts.
We believe the main downside risks to our rating and price target are:
· Increased competition and/or push back from insurance clients dampens the
pricing cycle. The insurance industry is well into the hard market and clients are
beginning to push back more strongly on price hikes while more insurers are
deploying capital and positioning themselves for growth. If the cycle begins to
turn, we believe there is a risk of multiple compression for insurers that have seen
an outsized benefit from higher prices.
· Adverse loss trends or social inflation re-emerge in casualty reserves.
Although unlikely to be a material risk for KNSL given its specific exposures and
low limits, the re-opening of the court system could drive a surge in pent-up
liability claims.

· Unfavorable loss experience emerges from new lines of business. Kinsale has
a strong underwriting track record and it is entering new lines of business in a
strong part of the cycle. Still, given the long-tail nature of casualty coverage, the
impact of badly underwritten risks is likely to persist.

The chart(s) show J.P. Morgan's continuing coverage of the stocks; the current analysts may or may not have covered it over the entire
period.
J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe:
J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the
average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's)
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of
the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's expected
total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe. If it
does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P.
Morgan's research website, https://www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
