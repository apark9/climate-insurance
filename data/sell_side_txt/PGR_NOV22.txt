Nov. '22 Earnings: Preserving capital
for growth?
Growth is coming with less effort (expense ratio 18.0% vs. 20%
pre-pandemic). PGR's pricing may appear more competitive as
the insurer believes taking rates is behind it. Given PGR's
premiums to surplus is near 3x and its negative marks, we are
less surprised that the co. halted its annual dividend this year.
Another step in building capital: Recall, earlier this year PGR raised $1.5bn in senior debt for
general corporate uses (not debt pre-funding). This time, PGR is not declaring an annual
dividend this year as it is evaluating its capital needs and wants to be best positioned for growth
in 2023. That does not preclude PGR from continuing to make its quarterly dividends or to
consider an annual dividend next year. While PGR's PIF growth for personal auto should
continue increasing in 2023, we are not anticipating a return to low-teens PIF growth levels seen
pre-pandemic (years when PGR was able to do both: grow and pay annual dividends).
"We are currently taking no additional actions to
bring the (leverage) ratio below 30% and have no
near-term plan or need for raising further
capital."

PGR tends to maintain underwriting leverage <3x. We think PGR's underwriting leverage
remains ~2.9x as we saw LTM ending Sept. 30, 2022, vs. 2.8x in '21 and 2.7x in '20 & '19. We think
underwriting leverage is a crude metric to inform RBC, and PGR has access to $4.2bn of
securities held in a non-insurance subsidiary. Still, given its actions to suspend its annual
dividend this year, underwriting leverage may matter more than we thought. We also recognize
that PGR's shareholders' equity has declined by 13% since YE '21, in large part reflecting
approximately $2.8bn of unrealized losses. While regulators do not take negative marks into
account, S&P does. S&P's P&C sector outlook is negative, partly reflecting their view of reduced
capital adequacy from these negative marks upon P&C insurers. PGR characterized its negative
marks as "temporary" given its 2.7 year asset duration; still, rating agency pressure could be a
factor.

PGR recognized positive personal auto PIF growth (+1.7% Nov. and +0.5% in Oct.) over the past
two months despite an unusually low expense ratio (18% Nov. vs. 20% pre-pandemic). PGR's
pricing may appear relatively more compelling to customers as it took rate increases on the
earlier side, we already saw, which we think reflects the continuation of higher new business
(new applications +20% in 3Q). As the pendulum swings back to growth, we worry that it may
be challenging for PGR to operationally demonstrate the same restraint and turn down business
when appropriate.
PGR's underlying loss ratio improved to 75.7% in Nov. from 77.6% in Oct. and 77.2% in Sept.
PGR's expense ratio fell to 18.0% in Nov. from 18.3% in Oct. and remains below pre-pandemic
levels (north of 20%). We do not think an expense ratio well below 20% (especially this month's
18.0%) is sustainable. PGR's underlying loss ratio three-month simple average of 76.8% has a
way to go to return to pre-pandemic levels (~68%). We think auto insurers will approach rate
adequacy in 2024 - to be sure, not a return to 2019 levels.
Nov. operating EPS of $0.54 beat our $0.24 estimate, reflecting better underlying income and a
$40mn reduction of September's Hurricane lan loss estimates. We had modeled catastrophe
loss of $42mn vs. PGR's -$4mn.

Why UNDERWEIGHT?
Our call on PGR takes a longer term
view. PGR may need to hold more
capital to support an evolving
business mix, which could lower
ROEs. Likewise, we struggle to see
how PGR could return to its
historical PIF growth rate, as the
company cut rates early during the
pandemic and is now playing catch
up, which is proving tough to gain
approval from regulators.
Upside case
USD 132.00
If PGR is able to achieve personal
auto rate adequacy and return to
historical PIF growth rates. If PGR
leverages its multivariate pricing
model across newer business lines.
Upside case reflects ~24x '23E EPS.
Downside case
USD 90.00
PGR's baseline pricing may be low,
brought on by a pandemic with
greater rate catch up. Downside
case reflects ~17x '23E EPS.

PIF Growth Spotlight
PGR reported personal auto PIF y/y growth of +1.7% in Nov. (in line with our estimate of +1.7%),
as compression in auto agency (-2.4% vs. our -2.3%) is more than offset by growth in auto direct
(+5.2% vs. our 5.0%).
As PIF declines remain more evident in agency, we expect PGR's customer mix to continue to
shift toward direct over time. To recap, direct represents 57% of personal auto PIF in Nov. '22.

Underlying loss ratio improving
PGR's underlying loss ratio improved to 75.7% in Nov. from 77.6% in Oct. and 77.2% in Sept.
PGR's expense ratio of 18.0% in Nov. has declined relative to its run rate. Collectively, PGR's
underlying combined ratio of 93.7% has improved from 95.9% in Oct. and 96.2% in Sept., but is
worse than 92.9% in August.

Inflation: Focus on Absolute Levels
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers rose 7.1% over the 12 months from
Nov. 2021 to Nov. 2022. Used car and truck CPI trails all items at -3.3% vs. 2.0% in Oct. Our focus
is on an absolute basis where used car pricing remains significantly elevated (see Figure 3).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the "industry coverage universe").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative (see
definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the
entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month investment
horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in
an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the "industry coverage universe":
U.S. Insurance/Non-Life
AIG, Inc. (AIG)
Chubb Limited (CB)
Palomar Holdings, Inc. (PLMR)

splits and dividends.
CD: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in debt securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
CE: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a market-maker in equity securities issued by Progressive Corp ..
J: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate is a liquidity provider and/or trades regularly in the securities by Progressive Corp. and/or in any related

K: Barclays Bank PLC and/or an affiliate has received non-investment banking related compensation (including compensation for brokerage services, if
applicable) from Progressive Corp. within the past 12 months.
M: Progressive Corp. is, or during the past 12 months has been, a non-investment banking client (securities related services) of Barclays Bank PLC
and/or an affiliate.
Valuation Methodology: Our $109 PT is based on 20x EPS and 3.2x BVPS (ex AOCI) on 2023E.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: The primary risks to our thesis are if PGR can
improve PIF growth back to double digit levels while producing underlying loss ratios <70% on a sustainable basis. This would require loss cost trends
abating, that is outside our base case. Next, PGR may be uniquely positioned to make a digital breakthrough within the small commercial lines market
($120bn premiums/TAM) if it can successfully leverage its multivariate pricing model it is known for on the personal auto side.
