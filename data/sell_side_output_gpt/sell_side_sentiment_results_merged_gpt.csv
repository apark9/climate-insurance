from 8.4% in the Q3 with property continuing to see pressure, (2) E&S submission flow
remains robust although momentum shifting more towards casualty vs property, (3)
social inflation continues to be a headwind with WRB pointing to casualty reinsurance
being slow in recognizing this dynamic (WRB saw casualty reinsurance NWP down 15%
given competitive environment), and (4) comp continues to see favorable trends.

TRV_1Q23.txt,TRV,2023,Q1,"Target Price Valuation for TRV: $183.00 from $182.00
Our price target of $183 is based on around a ~1.6x multiple of our projected 2024 book value estimate of around $115.82 and just
around 10x our 2024 EPS estimate of $18.10.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and reported / underlying margins coming in better
than expected.

TRV_3Q22.txt,TRV,2022,Q3,"Target Price Valuation for TRV: $180.00 from NC
Our price target of $180 is based on around a ~1.9x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $95.30 and 11.7x our
2023 EPS estimate of $15.35.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.

unclear what the benefit of non-cat weather was for TRV), (2) cats should be muted as
TRV saw extremely low losses, (3) other companies could seek to get more reinsurance
protection as they can offset the higher costs with continued price, and (4) reserves
continue to pose a risk, especially for the soft market years as TRV added more to its GL
