Our price target of $180 is based on around a ~1.53x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $117 and 12.4x our
2023 EPS estimate of $14.50.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.

TRV_1Q23.txt,TRV,2023,Q1,"Target Price Valuation for TRV: $183.00 from $182.00
Our price target of $183 is based on around a ~1.6x multiple of our projected 2024 book value estimate of around $115.82 and just
around 10x our 2024 EPS estimate of $18.10.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and reported / underlying margins coming in better
than expected.

TRV_3Q22.txt,TRV,2022,Q3,"Target Price Valuation for TRV: $180.00 from NC
Our price target of $180 is based on around a ~1.9x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $95.30 and 11.7x our
2023 EPS estimate of $15.35.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.
