Underlying combined ratio - Lower expense ratio is
less sustainable over the long term
PGR's underlying combined ratio of 89.5% in May deteriorated from 88.1% in Apr. and 98.6% in
Mar. driven by a worse underlying loss ratio of 73.2% (vs. 71.0% in Apr.) somewhat offset by a
lower expense ratio (16.3% in May vs 17.1% in Apr. and 21.1% in Mar.)",,PGR,0,0,0,0.026,0.095,0.879,78.45,5.14,7.6,0.7647058823529411,102
