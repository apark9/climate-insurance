from 8.4% in the Q3 with property continuing to see pressure, (2) E&S submission flow
remains robust although momentum shifting more towards casualty vs property, (3)
social inflation continues to be a headwind with WRB pointing to casualty reinsurance
being slow in recognizing this dynamic (WRB saw casualty reinsurance NWP down 15%

Our price target of $180 is based on around a ~1.53x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $117 and 12.4x our
2023 EPS estimate of $14.50.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.

Our price target of $180 is based on around a ~1.9x multiple of our projected 2023 book value estimate of around $95.30 and 11.7x our
2023 EPS estimate of $15.35.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for TRV
Risks to the downside include large catastrophe losses, adverse reserve development, increased competition, a deterioration in loss costs,
and a rise in D&O claims, while risks to the upside include stronger premium growth and margins coming in better than expected.

Our 2023 estimate is up by
$0.01 reflective of the Q2 beat,
which more than offsets a
weaker underlying combined
ratio for Q3/04. 2024 and 2025
go down reflective of a higher
underlying combined ratio in
insurance, counter-balanced by
a better reinsurance margin and
higher investment income.
